centennial , colo in a decision that surprised many in this community , a jury sentenced on friday to life in prison with no chance of parole , rejecting the death penalty for the man who carried out a that killed 12 people in a colorado movie theater as the courtroom waited for judge carlos samour jr to review the verdict , only the sound of him turning pages could be heard family members of the dead who sat through three months of wrenching , sometimes grisly testimony held hands and closed their eyes mr holmes stood flanked by his lawyers , one of them holding his arm a few feet away , his parents stood up to see better and gripped each other then the judge read each sentence of life , noting that jurors were unable to reach a unanimous verdict on any of the counts against mr holmes in colorado , death sentences must be unanimous if even one person dissents , the sentence is life in prison after court on friday , a juror who identified herself only by her juror number 17 said one juror had solidly opposed death nine jurors had favored death and two were unsure , but one wanted a life sentence there was nothing further to discuss at that point , juror 17 said it only takes one mr holmes showed little emotion as the sentence was read , standing before the judge with his hands in his pockets even as his mother collapsed into her husband one of the police officers who had responded to the attack at the theater sobbed , while others sat stoically some families in the gallery cried quietly or slumped in their chairs one man stormed out of the courtroom many had wanted death for the man responsible for so much carnage , but others had said they simply wanted the ordeal to be over , and had hoped to avoid the years of appeals that a death sentence would bring and focus instead on their families and memories of loved ones afterward , some family members expressed anger , with the grandfather of a slain 6yearold girl saying he suspected that a deathpenalty foe had infiltrated the jury others said the mere passing of a sentence , whether for life or death , was never going to bring them closure or an end to missing their sons and daughters our lives are forever altered , said sandy phillips , whose daughter , jessica ghawi , was killed ms phillips said it was difficult to think of her daughter s killer getting letters in prison , but that is what it is dave hoover , whose nephew a j boik was killed , said the process of grieving together and wading through the long trial over three years had made a family out of the people from illinois , arizona , texas , colorado and beyond whose loved ones had been killed we 're going to have a little more pain , a little more hurt in our lives , he told reporters outside the courthouse but the sun will come up some family members were clearly disappointed he s still living and breathing , said robert sullivan , grandfather of veronica mosersullivan , 6 , the youngest killed that night our loved ones are gone since mr holmes was of more than 160 counts of murder and attempted murder , his lawyers and prosecutors have been putting questions of his fate before the jury of nine women and three men prosecutors , emphasizing the human toll and indiscriminate cruelty of opening fire on a happy crowd of moviegoers , argued that he should join the three other men on colorado s death row in an earlier court filing , defense lawyers said they had offered to plead guilty in exchange for life in prison , but the district attorney , george brauchler , pursued a capital trial , saying that in this case , justice is death prosecutors argued that the rampage was so horrible , and the toll mr holmes exacted was so great , that death by lethal injection was the only just punishment after the verdict was read , execution opponents in colorado criticized mr brauchler s decision to pursue the death penalty , saying it needlessly stretched out the legal process through a painful , threemonth trial that cost millions of dollars we are extremely disheartened by the wastefulness of the trial , which could have been avoided two years ago , christopher decker , president of the , said in a statement outside the courthouse , as clouds swept over , mr brauchler said he was disappointed in the decision , and had apologized to the families of the victims for how the trial concluded but he said he still believed death was the appropriate sentence he added that when the defense lawyers had made their plea offer two years ago , they had refused his requests to have mr holmes examined by an independent mentalhealth expert , and had refused to turn over materials including his medical records and a spiral notebook in which he recorded his homicidal fantasies they said , you get none of it , ' he said throughout the trial , defense lawyers said it had not been hatred or a desire for notoriety that propelled mr holmes to plot and carry out the massacre , but a deepening form of schizophrenia that infected his mind with powerful delusions that killing people somehow increased his human capital the sentence surprised many because the jurors returned with their decision after just seven hours , and appeared united during previous deliberations they found mr holmes guilty after about 12 hours and had walked together to the precipice of sentencing him to death , agreeing after earlier sentencing deliberations that he was eligible to receive the death penalty but defense lawyers emphasized that jurors had no legal obligation to sentence him to death , and they urged jurors to listen to their own moral compasses , no matter what other jurors wanted two courtappointed psychiatrists who examined mr holmes and who testified for prosecutors during the guilt phase of his trial but , they said , he was able to know his actions were wrong when just after midnight on july 20 , 2012 , he strode into theater 9 in suburban aurora , clad in black body armor and armed with teargas canisters , a shotgun , a handgun and an assault rifle , and began spraying the crowd with ammunition he had amassed over several weeks nevertheless , the doctors said the shooting most likely would never have happened if not for mr holmes s mental illness the defense seized on that point in arguing to spare his life the shooting during a midnight premiere of a batman movie , the dark knight rises , was one of the worst mass attacks in colorado , a state also scarred by the 1999 massacre at it turned a midnight movie filled with teenagers and families into a bloody melee in which victims fell between the seats and boyfriends died shielding their girlfriends seventy people were wounded , including some who now are paralyzed , walk with canes or live with nightmares and bolts of pain the families of victims said they wanted to keep their focus and any public attention on the lives of their loved ones , and on the dozens of survivors grappling with chronic pain and coping with nightmares and grief as for the man who did it , ms phillips s husband , lonnie phillips , said , we want him to go into oblivion
with three weeks left in the regular season , a tight playoff race , like the one between the yankees and the toronto blue jays , can turn on the most trifling plays , ones that might easily be overlooked on a weeknight in may a groundout that advances a runner , a bobble that kills a chance to turn a double play , or an outfielder s hitting \( or missing \) the cutoff man with this in mind , the yankees signed a minor league outfielder named rico noel on july 2 after he asked for his release from the san diego padres noel has one discernible major league tool his legs noel , who once stole 90 bases in a season in the class a california league , was called up by the yankees when major league rosters were expanded on sept 1 he was making his first trip to the big leagues , having spent a month at class aaa scranton wilkesbarre being groomed as a pinchrunner in the first game of saturday s doubleheader against toronto , with the score tied at 55 in the 10th inning , he pinchran for brian mccann in the 10th inning and promptly stole second base , though he was stranded there , and the blue jays won the game in the 11th , 95 if there is any doubt about his potential ability to influence a game or a season as a pinchrunner , consider the lasting legacy of the man who is the link between noel and the yankees the former major leaguer dave roberts roberts s of second base against the yankees fueled boston s comeback from a threegamestonone deficit in the 2004 american league championship series the red sox went on to sweep the st louis cardinals and win their first world series in 86 years now the bench coach for the padres , roberts worked with noel , mostly during spring training , for the past four years yankees general manager brian cashman could not help laughing when he learned of the link it s ok , cashman said my therapist got dave roberts buried very deep in my head roberts , still a revered figure in boston , also laughed about it in a phone interview but he was not surprised that the yankees thought noel might make a difference late in the season , much the way terrance gore , a speedy lateseason callup , became a vital role player for the kansas city royals in the playoffs last year despite having never had a major league hit obviously , when you 're getting into september and the postseason , every base is important , roberts said when you get a dynamic player like rico or gore , it just changes the dynamic of an inning , sometimes without even stealing a base noel looks at roberts as a mentor , not only because of the work they have done on the nuances of base running but also because of their similar paths noel , like roberts , grew up as a son of a military man , an upbringing that helped imbue in him a strong sense of selfdetermination roberts often reminded noel that he did not reach the big leagues until he was 27 his biggest thing is that he was tough , said noel , who is 26 i'm sure he sees a lot of himself in me , that i 've got a positive mindset every day and that regardless of the situation i 've been put in , i believe i can battle out of it and become a success , no matter what s going on at the moment , noel s ascent is particularly poignant on the day the yankees called him up , his younger brother , orlandus , who has congestive heart failure , was at baylor university medical center in dallas having a batteryoperated pump installed to help his heart function until a suitable heart could be found for a transplant it s crazy how life works , noel said the best opportunity for me and the worst thing for my family are going on at the same time it could be conflicting for most people , but it s been ok for me and my family they have n't been able to come out and visit , but that does n't matter to me what they 're doing with him is more important vincent noel , their father , said that it would be 90 days before orlandus , 24 , would be ready for a transplant but that his condition had improved since the implant each day the yankees play , vincent his wife , mary and orlandus find the game on a hospital room television or a laptop that can be connected to the tv it s definitely a distraction , vincent noel said it allows him and us to get our minds off this at times tattooed on rico noel s right biceps is the outline of the state of louisiana , with intricately woven roots emanating from the bottom it is an ode to where noel was born , in the central city ville platte , where many of his relatives still live but every place noel has been seems to be stamped on him in some way in the years he spent in elementary school outside seattle , he became fascinated watching the many ways ichiro suzuki could influence a game with his speed noel s family moved to lawton , okla , where he played three sports in high school football , basketball and baseball and caught the eye of coastal carolina baseball coaches at a showcase tournament before his senior year noel , who is 5 feet 8 inches and 170 pounds , twice led ncaa division i in stolen bases he also helped the chanticleers reach backtoback super regionals , the second of which ended with a loss to south carolina , the eventual ncaa champion , in 2010 what his college coach , gary gilmore , remembers most is what happened when noel returned to coastal carolina after hitting in the low 200s in the cape cod league after his sophomore season the first time i saw him when he got back , i asked , what did you learn \? ' gilmore said he could have told me a million things , but he said flat out , i'm not good enough , and i'm going to take care of that' the next season , baseball america named noel a thirdteam allamerican he ca n't accept failure , gilmore said he s one of those guys , the more you knock him down , the tougher he gets he has no fear that quality prompted noel to ask the padres for his release in june they had drafted him in the fifth round in 2010 , and at their behest , he had taken up switchhitting for three seasons \( he hits righthanded naturally \) by 2014 , he had progressed to class aaa but with a new management team in san diego , an influx of outfielders and not enough playing time to begin the 2015 season , noel thought he needed to go somewhere else the decision was risky once you do n't have a job , you never know if you 're going to be able to get one again , noel said i knew there was some interest out there from what i 've done in the past , but there s never a guarantee i was n't happy with the situation i felt i was being put on the back burner , and i felt it was my time to get out of there he was released on june 28 the yankees called the next day i said , i'm not really asking for much i just want to play more than i have been playing , ' noel said they said , that will definitely happen' and i said , are you open to me being a callup to run bases , to put what i do best at the bigleague level \? ' they said , yeah , we 're open to it , ' but there were no guarantees and i did n't need any i knew if i had an opportunity , it would all work out noel is unlikely to bat for the yankees he was 1 for 17 with scranton wilkesbarre , and manager joe girardi pinchhit for him last week in boston with a 125 lead in the eighth inning after he had entered the game as a defensive replacement if there was any disappointment , noel kept it hidden on most days , he works with reggie willits , the yankees' baserunning and outfield coordinator on wednesday , noel worked on playing balls off the wall in the rightfield corner at yankee stadium but willits has mostly helped prepare noel for what is likely to be his most important role , as a lateinning pinchrunner we go over how you prepare mentally , willits said sometimes , you 've sat over there for a long time , maybe a week at a time you 're going to get out there and have a lot of adrenaline , so you 've got to fall back on your preparation the video work , trying to keep your jumps and your speed , all that stuff willits is familiar with that role , having performed it for the los angeles angels during the playoffs from 2007 to 2009 he knows it is not always a heroic assignment , such as when he was tagged out between third and home when his teammate erick aybar failed to lay down a squeeze bunt in the ninth inning of game 4 of a 2008 division series at fenway park the red sox won the game , and the series , in the bottom of the inning noel can only hope he will succeed if called upon , so he falls back on his new routine in each game around the fifth inning , he retreats to the clubhouse , stretches on a foam roller and loosens his legs on a stationary bicycle by the seventh inning , he is ready he has studied the pitcher and read the situation perhaps his job will require discretion if alex rodriguez is at the plate , it may be more useful for noel to distract the pitcher into a poor pitch or break up a double play than to try to steal a base but he could also find himself in a position like the one roberts faced in 2004 , when he entered a 43 game as a pinchrunner with mariano rivera on the mound for the yankees , the red sox down to the final three outs of their postseason everyone in fenway park knew that roberts , representing the tying run , had to steal second whatever the circumstances , noel is certain he will do with his opportunity what he has done at every turn on a baseball field he will run with it
chicago for months , it was the biggest political story in wisconsin a secret criminal investigation into whether s campaign in a 2012 recall election had illegally coordinated fundraising and spending with several conservative groups but in july , the state s conservativeleaning supreme court ordered the investigation ended , ruling that state campaign finance law included unconstitutionally vague language now mr walker s allies in the republicancontrolled state legislature are poised to pass new campaign finance provisions that would explicitly allow the practices that mr walker s campaign was accused of engaging in specifically , one proposed measure would make clear that independent groups that take sides on issues , but do not explicitly call for voting for a particular candidate , may indeed coordinate with political campaigns on friday , state senators are expected to consider that provision as part of a sweeping set of changes to the state s campaign finance laws that have already been approved by the wisconsin assembly state lawmakers have also moved with similar speed to attack another law that enabled the investigation into governor walker s campaign in the 2012 recall election , which he won last month , mr walker in political corruption cases , the very tool used to examine his campaign and state senators are also expected on friday to consider a measure , already approved by the state assembly , that would replace the , which oversees ethics and elections in the state , with two new boards in all , the moves highlight the level of lingering anger among conservatives in the state over the nowended investigation into mr walker s campaign , which resulted in no criminal charges you should n't be hounded just because you have a different political belief , robin vos , the republican speaker of the state assembly said in an interview thursday in which he described the largely secret investigation into mr walker s political campaign and conservative groups around the state as a witch hunt none of it was true , mr vos said not a speck of it was true in some of the changes to campaign finance rules , mr vos said lawmakers were simply codifying what the state supreme court had decided but critics said the proposed changes were flawed , blatantly partisan and counter to the state s history this is all just to feather the nests of politicians , said peter barca , the democratic minority leader in the state assembly the era of clean , open , transparent government in wisconsin is over it is just strictly an invitation for corruption the investigation into the 2012 campaign looked at whether mr walker s advisers directed interactions with outside conservative groups , including the wisconsin club for growth and wisconsin manufacturers commerce , and whether that violated state law on disclosure rules and donation limits for political purposes lawyers for some of the groups said no laws had been violated , in part , because the outside groups never explicitly told people whom they should vote for in the 2012 recall another provision of the legislation the senate will be considering friday would allow individual donors to give twice as much as before to political campaigns in the case of a candidate for governor , a person could give as much as 20 , 000 the measure would also permit corporations and unions to give unlimited amounts of money to political parties and to legislative campaign committees the proposal would make it clear that outside socalled issue advocacy groups , which are not required to reveal their donors , could coordinate with political campaigns a notion supporters said was merely conveying the supreme court s july ruling issue advocacy groups are barred from explicitly urging people to cast votes for a particular candidate , yet the boundaries can be murky and ads sometimes imply support for or against a candidate without mentioning names a spokeswoman for mr walker said he would review the campaign finance proposal , and that he supported overall reform of the state s government accountability board this is a real outlier among states , matt rothschild , executive director of the wisconsin democracy campaign , a nonprofit that tracks election spending , said of the proposed changes dark money would have a field day in wisconsin if this thing goes through this renders meaningless any ability to limit a campaign s fundraising
east rutherford , nj giants defensive end jason pierrepaul , who lost his right index finger in a fourth of july fireworks accident , did not report for the first day of training camp thursday , and the team coowner john mara said the giants had no information on the condition of pierrepaul , their best defensive player i do n't know how many fingers he has , mara said we have no idea what type of condition he is in , and that does n't give us any comfort we do n't know anything more than you know asked if he had any idea when pierrepaul planned to report to training camp , mara answered , none mara added that until the giants examined pierrepaul , they could not count on him playing this year we have to plan on moving forward without him , mara said until we see him , i do n't see how we can count on him , certainly not for the opening of the season mara spoke in a calm voice but frequently voiced his frustration with pierrepaul , who did not allow giants medical personnel to visit him at a florida hospital shortly after the accident , which caused other unspecified injuries to his right hand in march , the giants made pierrepaul their franchise player , which guaranteed him 148 million this season if he signed the franchise offer , which pierrepaul did not do the two sides were hoping to reach a longterm deal , and the giants had made pierrepaul a multiyear offer that contract offer has been withdrawn by the team the giants could still withdraw their franchise tag offer , which would make pierrepaul an unrestricted free agent , but mara said that was not in the team s immediate plans i do n't think we 're going to do anything until we actually see where he s at , mara said he s a rare athlete who has played at a very high level before he is a great kid , and we 've loved having him around here he fits in well i can only surmise that he s not receiving very good advice the team could also negotiate a compromise contract for an amount based on how many games pierrepaul might play this season all of that is negotiable , mara said but nothing is on the table until we see him and can assess the damage caused by the accident mara said that various giants officials had contacted pierrepaul since the accident , including coach tom coughlin , who said on thursday that his text to pierrepaul immediately after the accident went unanswered we 're all concerned about this young man first and foremost , coughlin said after a brief giants workout but it is difficult to extend this concern when we feel like he should be here like mara , coughlin said that pierrepaul s absence would not sour his relationship with the team as far as souring , that s not going to sour anything , coughlin said i am concerned about him as a young man and anxious to know exactly what he s dealing with , and then we will know what we 're dealing with giants players for the most part kept a distance from the controversy enveloping pierrepaul , careful not to criticize his decision to stay away from training camp but not putting themselves at odds with management s position either that is a stance players commonly take when a teammate is in the midst of a contract dispute or an impasse with a team s front office to date , most of the communication between the giants and pierrepaul has been by text messages mara said he had texted pierrepaul in the days after the accident he told me that this was a little bump in the road and that he would be back as good as ever , mara said i'm disappointed he s not here because this is the best place for him we have the best training staff in the league and have access to some of the best doctors in the world mara conceded that he was speaking with reporters in an effort to get his message to pierrepaul mara said the giants had had little contact with pierrepaul s representatives asked what his primary message was to pierrepaul , mara said , come home we miss you extra points wide receiver victor cruz appeared to be moving without any discomfort from the serious knee injury he sustained 10 months ago cruz , who tore the patellar tendon in his right knee in a game at philadelphia , participated in the teamwide conditioning evaluation and was running well afterward , cruz , with a smile , estimated that he was at 93 percent of full strength he expected to practice in the giants' first full practice friday afternoon odell beckham jr , who was limited in spring workouts by a hamstring strain , also participated in the conditioning evaluation , occasionally running smoothly side by side with cruz both players passed the test wide receiver james jones , who played for the giants' offensive coordinator , ben mcadoo , when mcadoo was a coach with the green bay packers , is expected to visit the giants on friday and could sign a oneyear contract after seven seasons in green bay , jones , 31 , had 73 receptions with six touchdowns last season for the oakland raiders
daytona beach , fla jeff gordon s last daytona 500 began as an ode to his legacy , but it might be best remembered as a harbinger of what is to come in  joey logano announced his arrival as a star on sunday when he held off a pack of elite , veteran drivers , kevin harvick , denny hamlin and jimmie johnson in the final laps to become the secondyoungest driver to win nascar s most prestigious race \( trevor bayne was 20 when he won in 2011 \) even though he is a ninetime sprint cup race winner and a daytona 500 champion , logano , 24 , says it is too early to start talking about legacy i feel like i got over 20 years left in my career , logano said it s hard to look that far down the path but projections of greatness followed logano even before he was a teenager , when none other than the future hall of famer mark martin anointed logano the next great champion logano was expected to step into nascar and win daytona 500s at 18 even gordon did not do that he was 25 when he won the first of his three harley j earl trophies it was all too much too soon for logano , and he nearly washed out after four mostly unsuccessful seasons at joe gibbs racing if not for a failed drug test by a j allmendinger , who lost his job at team penske in 2012 as a result , logano might not have had a landing spot in the sprint cup in 2013 but when the seat opened , the penske driver brad keselowski lobbied for logano i think it s no secret that i got thrown into the series too young , inexperienced , did n't know what i had to do , logano said obviously the switch over to team penske the best move of my career to be here , get teamed up with a great team it was an opportunity for me to regroup , be who i wanted to be as an adult not an 18yearold kid anymore go out there and work hard logano has shown the promise that martin saw all along , qualifying for the 10race playoff for the first time and finishing eighth in the standings in 2014 , he won five races and was contending to win at homesteadmiami speedway before a disastrous pit stop late in the race cost him a chance at winning the event and the 2014 cup championship that went to harvick you move on , logano said it s history it s past you focus on the future if you dwell on the past , you never move forward it did not take long to erase that memory logano was a factor throughout sunday s race , even when gordon led for 87 laps , with his teammates johnson , earnhardt and kasey kahne providing escort and demonstrating the power of the hendrick motorsports engines logano was never far away he had led for six laps early , fell behind and kept battling , leading six separate times for a total of 31 laps on the final restart , he held off one last challenge from the leaders with two laps to go and then outgunned the field to take the checkered flag gordon finished 33rd after crashing on the backstretch he was my favorite driver when i first started racing when i was 6 years old , logano said of gordon i rooted for the 24 car because he was the young guy now i'm racing against him he s not the young guy anymore , but he s still a lot of fun to race against being able to race against him today for the lead multiple times in the daytona 500 , that s a dream come true for any kid i 'll always remember that , for sure it was an inauspicious ending for gordon it was a magical beginning to 2015 for logano the victory means he will be in the playoff for the third year in a row but that is to be expected for logano , one of the premier drivers in nascar now every single weekend , you know you 're going to have to beat the 22 , said hamlin , logano s former joe gibbs racing teammate that s something we did n't say about joey just three years ago the only question is how many years they will be saying that about logano roger penske , who has worked with the best in motorsports for decades , thinks he already knows the answer you saw what he did last year , penske said this is just the start , i think , of a career he s going to be a guy at the top for a long time
elgin , ill she ordinarily did not wear a veil but it was required at the islamic school where she worked , and she remembers being surprised when the head of the school , a conservative imam , suggested that she remove it when the imam , mohammad abdullah saleem , came into her office , she said , he would sometimes touch her cheek or put an arm around her shoulder mr saleem was revered in her closeknit community , and she did not object at first but simply being alone together represented a forbidden intimacy , and looking back , she said those first gestures should have been more alarming it s not something that gets done , the 23yearold woman said recently men and women do n't even shake hands over time , she said the touching became more aggressive , reaching a point that she did something almost unheardof in her community she told people her family , a social worker , an islamic scholar recently , she went to the police as word spread of what she had told them , three other women came forward , telling detectives that as young girls they had been molested by mr saleem in the next few days , the women will name mr saleem in a lawsuit that accuses him of decades of assault and child sex abuse , according to steven a denny , their lawyer but the accusations are already widely known and deeply felt within the community of indian and pakistani muslim immigrants and their families in the chicago area for whom the institute of islamic education , the school that mr saleem founded , is a focal point they have highlighted the kinds of tensions that divide a small , cloistered segment of mr saleem s followers from a more assimilated generation that bristles at the notion that such matters should be handled privately abuse allegations against catholic priests and jewish rabbis have brought similar anguish to insular communities suddenly exposed to outsiders , in a crisis but the chicago case comes with added baggage in a community where discussion of sex is taboo and many girls are forbidden to attend school health classes dating is uncommon or secretive , many marriages are arranged , and a blemish on a young woman s reputation can render her unmarriageable the accusations are particularly jarring because of mr saleem s stature in the south asian community , he is like billy graham he s the archbishop of chicago , said omer mozaffar , an islamic scholar who serves as the muslim chaplain at loyola university chicago and who acted as a mediator between mr saleem and his first accuser last year mr saleem said in a brief phone interview that his accusers are lying he referred questions to his lawyer , thomas t glasgow , who said that after an internal investigation by the school , i have not seen any evidence to substantiate anything in a statement posted on its website , the institute of islamic education attributed the accusations to individuals outside our community seeking to discredit the school s beliefs the individuals involved do not wish to seek privacy and resolution , but are actively seeking publicity for their claims , the statement said , which has since been removed from the site mr saleem , 75 , was part of a generation of immigrants from india and pakistan who settled in the chicago area in the 1970s and 1980s they shared apartments , prayed in a basement mosque and socialized almost exclusively among one another mr saleem was a student of the deobandi school , a that espouses a fundamentalist version of islam he had the title maulana , an honorific given to prominent scholars friends let him stay in a spare room , where he taught children the quran the community retained many of its beliefs and customs purity and honor were paramount girls wore head scarves , kept their arms and legs covered , and were excused from school health classes where puberty and reproduction were discussed in some families , talking about sex in any way was unthinkable a lot of the attitudes around sexuality and marriage , i would literally describe them as ultravictorian , said hamzah maqbul , the imam of a mosque in rockford , a nearby city mr saleem founded his school in 1989 to teach students to memorize the quran in accordance with the islamic values and traditions of the earlier periods of islam , according to its bylaws it has grown into one of the country s most prominent schools of its kind and one of the few in which the students , typically ages 10 to 17 , are boarded for several years subjects like math and english are offered , but primarily through computer programs and never at the expense of quran studies the school is not recognized by the state and does not award accredited diplomas as the muslim community grew , most families assimilated , finding no conflict between their faith and their adopted homeland , said muhammad shamsi , 70 , who helped organize the school but is no longer involved with it raising children in america accelerated that process , he said but others , including some of mr saleem s most devoted followers , resisted , said mr mozaffar , the scholar and loyola chaplain the fear is of becoming americanized , he said and that includes a decline in morality , losing a person s islam , a person s faith and so faith gets mixed in with culture the young woman who first accused mr saleem was born in the united states to indian parents and graduated from an american college she hoped the secretarial job at the school would be a springboard to a corporate human resources position while she was making copies in april , she said , mr saleem pulled her onto his lap and held her there , lifting her dress as he groped her i just looked at the wall or the ceiling and just kept saying , this is very uncomfortable , ' she said after he left , she said , she found something sticky on the black pants she wore beneath her dress she confided in her cousin , her mother and a social worker , and ultimately mr mozaffar she quit her job , and though she said she was reluctant to press the issue , she wanted an admission and an apology mr mozaffar agreed to mediate hanging over the entire process was the threat that the allegations would destroy her reputation such concerns are common in abuse cases but are particularly acute in a community that values virginity so highly , said nadiah mohajir , executive director of , a sexual health advocacy group for muslim women there is this fear of who s going to marry you now \? ' she said we can say , you do n't want a man who would hold that against you' but in practice , that decreases their pool so much that it s completely unfair to even say ms mohajir said educating muslim women about sexual health could make people so uncomfortable that she did not talk about her job with some family members getting her programs accepted in mosques has been difficult , she said , and fundraising is incredibly challenging mr mozaffar said he had ultimately brokered a settlement in which mr saleem signed a handwritten document saying he had apologized and admitted to his actions but the document does not specify what actions mr saleem indicated that he was apologizing for the sin of zina , or consensual extramarital sexual contact , mr mozaffar said that agreement was supposed to end things , but word spread through the community , and mr mozaffar addressed them on his blog , writing that it was public knowledge what mr saleem had done and that he had admitted the details to me , face to face angry commenters accused him of undermining mr saleem dear brothers and sisters this matter does not concern you , one wrote regardless if the allegations are true or false he is a much better muslim than all of us please stop spreading information regarding him he has reached a very old age you should be instead focusing on how you can spend more time in his presence mr mozaffar deleted his post , but not before two women in their 40s saw it and told advocates that mr saleem had abused them in the early 1980s , when he was teaching from his bedroom one woman said mr saleem began touching her when she was 12 once , she said , he sat on a bed , covered in a brown blanket , and put her hand on his genitals while he taught her a chapter of the quran called alqari'a , about the day of judgment when people will be held to account for their good and evil deeds the quran is right on top of us and he is doing this , she said what disrespect he had in front of the quran a second woman said that , when she was in sixth grade , mr saleem kissed her and touched her , remarking , you 're really growing up the new allegations prompted the former secretary to go to the police , despite the concerns of some family members she took with her the pants with the dry , white stain if this happened in my parents' generation , nobody would 've ever found out , she said the elgin police and prosecutors have interviewed the three women a fourth , who declined to be interviewed , told the authorities that mr saleem molested her while she was a student in 2002 and 2003 , according to mr denny , her lawyer mr glasgow , the lawyer for mr saleem , said he was unaware of these allegations the statute of limitations has expired on the claims dating to the 1980s it s an ongoing investigation into allegations of sexual offenses , said cmdr ana lalley of the elgin police mr saleem said in the interview that he was still teaching at the school , though he officially retired in october , and that his son ubaidulla had replaced him these are good , peaceful , kind , conscientious people trying to do the right thing in the face of some pretty nasty allegations against a former employee , mr glasgow , the lawyer , said mr mozaffar said he had heard criticism that he had brought negative attention on muslims at a time when terrorism fears have made many americans suspicious of them there is a notion that we are already under assault why add more fuel \? he said but he said none of this had to do with islam the catholics are n't the only ones who have pedophiles , and the muslims are n't the only ones who have terrorists , he said
on a recent morning at persahabatan hospital in east jakarta , patients , some from remote villages accessible only by boat , gathered in a waiting room nearby , lab technicians used new diagnostic technology to test sputum samples for multidrugresistant tuberculosis , in an effort to tackle a growing caseload of the deadly disease indonesia s recently swornin president , joko widodo , takes the reins of a rising economic power poised to play a larger role on the world stage but he also confronts a set of entrenched public health problems fueled by the poverty in which millions of indonesians still live none is more urgent than the spread of drugresistant tuberculosis across this sprawling archipelago thanks to support from the global fund to fight aids , tuberculosis and malaria , the international financing mechanism established in 2002 to help poor countries address these diseases , indonesia has been able to provide the costly drugs for drugresistant tuberculosis to patients free of charge it has also supplied laboratories like the one at persahabatan with the xpert mtb rif device , which allows health workers to diagnose suspected cases of drugresistant disease in under two hours \( conventional methods take as long as eight weeks \) these are encouraging steps , but as indonesia is learning , the tools of clinical medicine can do only so much this is a social disease , dr erlina burhan , the head of pulmonology medicine at persahabatan , told me , referring to multidrugresistant tuberculosis we have 7 , 000 new mdr cases a year , and many of those are defaulting on their treatment it s easy to understand why for one thing , there s the financial strain the drugs may be free , but as a recent multinational study found , the cost to patients for everything from transportation and hospital stays to months of missed work can amount to a year s earnings and then there is the treatment itself a grueling , twoyear regimen of toxic drugs involving months of daily injections and possible severe side effects and so stigmatized is tuberculosis in indonesia that when volunteers go house to house looking for cases , families often try to hide sick relatives most of our patients do n't know how the disease is transmitted , dr burhan said , so they return home and spread their drugresistant strain to others the world health organization estimates that every untreated mdr patient will infect , on average , between 10 and 15 people per year and some of those may be their children , in whom tuberculosis is more difficult to diagnose and treat in october , the who reported that improved data collection had revealed an epidemic significantly larger than previously estimated in 2013 , nine million people developed active tuberculosis , and of those , nearly half a million were infected with multidrugresistant strains indonesia , home to the world s fifthhighest number of tuberculosis cases , is expected to publish its own prevalence survey soon experts believe those figures will only add to the global burden the white house should view these trends with alarm after all , drugresistant tuberculosis is a threat to people everywhere , including in the united states an outbreak in new york city that started in the late '80s and involved drugresistant strains cost at least 1 billion to quell given that caring for a single case of extremely drugresistant tuberculosis can run more than half a million dollars , a similar outbreak today could impose crippling burdens on health departments at the front lines of the nation s defense and the united states almost certainly underestimates its vulnerability despite congressional calls to increase tuberculosis funding for the current year , president obama proposed a 19 percent cut to the global tuberculosis budget of the united states agency for international development , which would put tuberculosis funding below 200 million for the first time in five years the spending bill recently passed by congress rejected those cuts and maintained level funding , at 236 million that is still far below the 400 million per year public health advocates say is needed to combat the world s leading curable killer in 2013 , president obama pledged that america would contribute up to 5 billion to the global fund over the next three years but by opposing increases to bilateral tuberculosis funding , the president jeopardizes this generous investment while global fund grants support the purchase of drugs and diagnostics , like the 30 , 000 xpert device , the agency does n't have the incountry staff to ensure the tools' effective implementation it s here that usaid plays a vital role , by training technicians , strengthening supply chains and educating doctors and nurses about novel therapies without that help , our aid dollars do n't go nearly as far as they could between 2010 and 2012 , for example , indonesia , though a major recipient of global fund support , used only half of the funds allocated for tuberculosis control activities because it lacked the capacity to use that aid perhaps the most tragic consequence of underfunding tuberculosis control , though , is that it undermines the fight against hiv and aids after billions of dollars and decades of research , antiretroviral drugs have transformed what was a death sentence into a manageable chronic disease in spite of this monumental public health achievement , the leading killer of people living with hiv today , accounting for onequarter of aids deaths worldwide , is tuberculosis , a disease so neglected that the current firstline treatment is more than 50 years old americans can no longer afford to be indifferent to the rise of drugresistant tuberculosis as indonesia illustrates , technology alone ca n't solve the problem at least in the short term , poor countries need the specialized expertise only america can provide when the president s budget requests for the next fiscal year are released , they should reflect the reality that if drugresistant tuberculosis is allowed to flourish in faraway slums , it will most certainly return to haunt us and at potentially great cost
beijing the highrise apartment complex closest to tianjin s toxic chemical storage inferno was only 2 , 000 feet away , despite chinese laws requiring a 3 , 200foot minimum distance from hazardous sites the disclosure was among the new details emerging on friday that suggested possible criminal negligence , mixed with rife speculation of an official coverup , in the aftermath of china s thirdlargest city and a major northeast seaport , about 90 miles east of beijing with the death toll rising to at least 85 on friday , more than 700 hospitalized and an unknown number still missing in the smoldering wreckage , the fire was shaping up as one of china s worst industrial calamities it appeared to expose the kinds of regulatory lapses that have plagued the country s transformation into a global economic powerhouse government officials , acutely aware of concerns over the fire , have sought to suppress unauthorized information they seemed unprepared for the tough questions posed at a news conference in tianjin on friday , including why hazardous chemicals had been stockpiled so near populated areas they abruptly ended the conference with uncharacteristic defiance , some chinese news outlets did their own reporting anyway local residents have said they had no idea that any risk had been posed by the warehouses where the fire began , a modest blaze that suddenly exploded in mammoth fireballs they engulfed office buildings and port facilities , as well as onlookers who had gathered to watch the firefighters at work the developers of vanke port city , a residential complex that is practically at the incinerated area s doorstep and has now been evacuated indefinitely , said they had been told when they started construction in 2010 that the warehouses in question handled only common goods we were never notified that the warehouses were modified to handle dangerous goods , a spokesman for the developer said in an email according to chinese law , facilities that handle hazardous materials must be more than 3 , 200 feet from homes and public buildings vanke is 2 , 000 feet away suspicions among the populace were further raised by the censorship of information the vacuum was filled by online speculation about whether the owners of rui hai international logistics , the company that owned the warehouse where the blasts originated , might be connected to senior government leaders the government s online corporate registry for tianjin remained offline nearly two days after the disaster , fueling concerns about a possible coverup officials have said the blasts disabled the website , which lists details about corporate ownership questions have also been raised about whether the hundreds of firefighters who raced to the scene had been aware of the potential hazards , and whether they had been trained to combat complex and volatile chemical fires at least 24 of the dead were firefighters according to news reports , about 700 tons of sodium cyanide , a compound that releases highly toxic gas , had been stored at the rui hai warehouse the site was also licensed to handle calcium carbide , a dangerous compound known to release flammable gases when mixed with water one fire official told the paper , an online chinese publication , that water might have been used to douse the initial fire southern weekly , a newspaper known for occasional muckraking reporting , quoted a firefighter who said he had received no instructions about the risks of spraying water on the fire during a news conference on thursday , a fire official , zhou tian , said that the first fire brigade to reach the scene had been trying to determine the contents of the rui hai warehouse , and that a second brigade had arrived moments before the explosions they were caught off guard , so the injuries are grave , he said officials have said they cannot determine exactly what kinds of chemicals were stored at the site , saying that the company had provided them with conflicting accounts earlier reports in the state news media said that senior company managers had been detained for questioning in a rare bit of good news , the state news media reported friday that rescue workers had found an injured firefighter at the scene throughout the day , explosions shook the site , including a series of small blasts at dusk that sent columns of alternately black and white smoke into the air bulldozer operators sent by the local railroad company were helping clear paths through an otherworldly jumble of scorched vehicles and battered shipping containers nearby , a cordon of paramilitary police officers wearing face masks prevented people from returning to their homes i have n't changed my clothes in three days , said one resident , yuan ping , 30 , a telecommunications worker who described how she lost her dog as she and her family scrambled to safety a police officer told me the air inside was so toxic that my dog was probably dead another resident reacted angrily to published reports describing a study by the tianjin academy of environmental sciences that endorsed rui hai s plans to expand its business into handling hazardous chemicals the report , produced last year , claimed that a survey of local residents had found unanimous support for the project that s nonsense , the resident said from the hospital where he was being treated for a broken arm if we had known , who would have dared to live there \? with roughly 6 , 000 residents forced from their homes and countless others unsure whether it was safe to breathe the air , government officials struggled to reassure the public that there was little danger on friday , they acknowledged that sodium cyanide had been found in sewer pipes under a port , but they said workers had shut the drains , ensuring that none of the chemical would seep into the adjacent bohai bay according to the beijing news , rui hai at one point submitted documents saying it did not handle dangerous chemicals , but claimed in a subsequent filing that it had received the required permission from port officials the newspaper , quoting a deputy manager at rui hai , said workers were unsure what was stored at the site , a way station for chemicals awaiting export or transport to other parts of china

washington mitt romney called him speaker john a boehner pleaded with him representative fred upton said , he needs to do this for the team , that s what we are all telling him it is a case in which , one of his colleagues said , the job is seeking the man the courtship of representative to be speaker of the house escalated on multiple fronts friday , and mr ryan , the powerful chairman of the house ways and means committee , signaled that he was headed home to wisconsin to reconsider his repeatedly stated position that he does not want the job even that thin reed of possibility seemed to only further fuel the ardor of republicans , many of whom emerged from a conference meeting on friday morning saying they saw no one else with the potential to bring the fractured party back together i just think he s the complete package and the natural consensus player , said representative tom cole , republican of oklahoma this is a guy it s very unusual for a house member he has genuine national stature , mr cole added he has been a thought leader in the he is a consistent conservative with house republicans in turmoil and party leaders fearing that the disarray could spill into the 2016 presidential and congressional campaigns , the push for mr ryan to run for speaker was taking on more urgency but despite the many entreaties , the house adjourned for a weeklong recess on friday , and mr ryan left his suitors wanting , returning to his family and advisers in janesville , wis , to discuss his future , and , he said , to watch the packers game on sunday the biggest influence on his decision is expected to come from his wife , janna , who worked as a lawyer and lobbyist in washington before moving to her husband s hometown to raise their children , who are in school there party elders , conservative leaders and republican colleagues have been pressuring mr ryan , 45 , who was mr romney s vicepresidential running mate in 2012 , saying he should run for the good of the country , to rescue the institution of congress and to protect the political interests of republicans over all there s really only one choice is the guy to bring us together , said mr upton , of michigan , the chairman of the energy and commerce committee and a friend of mr ryan s , who said he had corralled him on the house floor mr romney , in a statement , appealed to mr ryan s sense of duty i would n't presume to tell paul what to do , but i do know that he is a man of ideas who is driven to see them applied for the public good , mr romney said every politician tries to convince people that they are that kind of leader almost none are paul is but even as mr ryan was said to be reconsidering , his close associates cautioned that he had no intention of fighting for the job and would most likely accept it only by acclamation including the support of the hardline conservatives who pressed to and helped drive the majority leader , kevin mccarthy of california , on thursday if the conference decides as a whole that they want him to do it , it is possible , said a republican official close to mr ryan who asked not to be identified because he was not authorized to speak publicly if there are still those guys who are holding out trying to make a point , it is not going to happen while many hardliners spoke admiringly of mr ryan , they were also adamant that they would not simply jump to support handing him the speaker s gavel many of them viewed mr boehner s resignation and mr mccarthy s departure from the race as victories , and they have pledged to continue pressing for major changes in house rules to empower the rankandfile members and weaken the leadership , including the speaker asked if he would support mr ryan , representative john fleming of louisiana , a member of the conservative house freedom caucus , said , i would want to see the full cast of candidates mr fleming noted that the freedom caucus , which has about 40 members , previously announced its support for representative daniel webster , a littleknown lawmaker from florida , and would stick with him until other candidates emerged and could be interviewed by the group remember , for us much of it has to do with the process and empowering individual members and the constituents that sent us here , mr fleming said so it s not always about the personality demands for procedural changes notwithstanding , republicans are now confronting a serious leadership crisis , and mr ryan has sufficient respect that the hardliners may feel intense pressure to get behind him representative jason chaffetz of utah , the chairman of the oversight and government reform committee who is also running for speaker , said on friday that he would gladly yield to mr ryan , calling him the most qualified person to do it mr chaffetz added the reason i got into the race was people like paul ryan were not stepping up to do it indeed , mr ryan had been so adamant about not wanting the speaker s job that he issued a statement declaring he would not seek the position before many republicans had even left the room where mr mccarthy made his announcement along with eric cantor of virginia , the former majority leader , mr mccarthy and mr ryan were depicted as the young faces of the during the election cycle of 2010 , when it won back the house majority they also wrote a book together called young guns in the conference meeting on friday morning , mr boehner , who had been hounded by the farright flank of his party for nearly his entire time as speaker , reassured rankandfile lawmakers that he would remain until a new speaker was chosen that suggested he could stay as speaker and in congress beyond his previously announced retirement date at the end of october , though mr boehner said he believed a new speaker could be chosen before then , and he was among those trying to convince mr ryan to run the hardright lawmakers who pushed for mr boehner s ouster have made a long list of demands for changes to how the house operates , including major adjustments to the composition of a committee that decides other committee chairmanships and alterations to the way legislation and amendments can be brought to the floor those demands , as well as others regarding various leadership posts , appeared to contribute to mr mccarthy s decision to withdraw , even though he had been the heavy favorite to succeed mr boehner some conservatives rejected the idea that mr ryan or anyone could instantly unify house republicans i frankly think there is no silver bullet candidate that is going to bring us together , either , said representative luke messer of indiana it s going to take a combination of things other lawmakers said mr ryan was the ideal choice he s the consensus candidate at this point , said representative darrell issa of california mr cole , of oklahoma , said he believed mr ryan truly did not want the position he clearly does n't want the job i ca n't blame him for that , mr cole said but honestly this is a case where the job is seeking the man , and we need him

concord , nc carl edwards left his home at roush fenway racing after 11 years , hoping a switch this season to a more competitive team , joe gibbs racing , would give him a shot at an elusive sprint cup championship in his 12th race in his new ride , the no 19 toyota , edwards took a step closer to contending with a victory sunday night in the cocacola 600 at charlotte motor speedway the win virtually secures him a berth in the 10race playoff the chase for the sprint cup at the end of the year jgr is back , and these toyotas are great , edwards declared in victory lane after his fuelmileage strategy left him out front while martin truex jr and others were forced to head to pit road late the win was edwards s first since june 22 , when he was still with roush , and his first at all with the crew chief darian grubb , with whom edwards was paired at the start of the season grubb had been the crew chief for tony stewart when stewart won the 2011 cup championship by beating edwards in the final race of the season ever since tony and i battled for that championship , i wanted to work with him , and now i can , edwards said that s what he does on the box he takes a mediocre day like that , and he puts us in a good position the joe gibbs racing contingent was strong from top to bottom matt kenseth , who started on the pole , finished in fourth denny hamlin , who won the allstar race here on may 16 , led 53 laps and was in position to win before having to dip onto pit road because of a loose wheel , settling for an eighthplace finish the team also got back kyle busch , who was competing in his first cup race in a crash in a lowerlevel race at daytona in february he , too , was forced to pit road for fuel late in the race and ended up 11th after racing in the top five edwards s victory bucked hendrick motorsports' recent dominance , particularly on the oneandahalfmile ovals that are prevalent on the cup circuit \( jimmie johnson and kevin harvick , both of whom race in hendrick equipment , had combined to win the last seven cup races on such ovals , dating to october \) harvick , of stewarthaas racing , contended throughout sunday s race and led 26 laps , but he was among those who went to pit road for fuel late , and he finished ninth johnson struggled and twice spun out during the race , the second time crashing into the pit road wall he wound up 40th greg biffle s finish , in second place , was perhaps even more surprising than edwards s this was only his second top 10 of the season but if edwards thought his race team was back , biffle made clear he did not believe the competition had caught up to the chevrolets , particularly the hendrick cars and engines , which are also used by stewarthaas racing and others we certainly have n't come anywhere close to catching them , biffle , who drives a ford for roush fenway racing , said one common thread it looks like to me is chevy it looks like they 're head and shoulders better than the toyota and fords they definitely have a stranglehold on it , it seems like those chevrolets were fast once again sunday night still , truex who drives a chevrolet for the onecar furniture row team , affiliated with richard childress racing had the dominant racecar , leading a racehigh 131 laps before being forced to pit late for fuel he finished a frustrating fifth i do n't know what to do about fuel mileage races , truex said i 've never , ever , ever , ever , ever one time in my whole career come down on the right end of them , so i do n't know it hurts to come home fifth and lead that many laps all of seemed to have lost on sunday , though a fuel mileage victory was hardly a match for the drama that played out earlier in the day in  nascar has had trouble making racing on these oneandahalfmile ovals contentious and entertaining because the aerodynamics of its bulky stock cars inhibit passing for the lead the final , heartstopping laps of the indianapolis 500 contained numerous passes in the race at charlotte motor speedway , there were 22 lead changes but none of the sidebyside racing and laterace passes and that does not appear set to change it s never going to get fixed , harvick said last week , adding your car is never going to run as fast behind another car as it does by itself it s just impossible it s just absolutely impossible
taiwan celebrated the 70th anniversary of japan s defeat in world war ii with a military parade emphasizing the contribution of the republic of china , under chiang kaishek , to the allied victory this month , after a military parade featuring troops riding motorcycles and mountain bikes , apache attack helicopters flying in formation and shirtless frogmen waving paddles from the backs of trucks , president ma yingjeou of taiwan told a handful of world war ii veterans that their contribution to defeating japan was not forgotten facing history , he said , there is only one truth that the eightyear war of resistance was led by the republic of china , and the victory was the result of the heroic struggle of the whole nation s army and civilians brave struggle under the leadership of chairman chiang kaishek mr ma has repeated those words in one form or another throughout this summer , during events in taiwan to mark the 70th anniversary of the war s end they are meant to remind the world of china s critical contribution to japan s defeat and that it was chiang s party , the kuomintang , that led the fight , not mao zedong s communists the communists won a subsequent civil war and established the people s republic in 1949 , forcing the kuomintang to flee to taiwan but even as the role of the kuomintang in japan s defeat is better understood , some in taiwan complain that a devastating wartime attack on the island a deadly 1945 air raid on taipei by american bombers has been ignored , with no official events to mark its anniversary and no physical memorial for the dead that lacuna is a product of taiwan s complex history , which survives in its presentday political divide between those who see taiwan s identity as part of a greater china and those who see it as an independent nation during the war , taiwan was a colony of japan , which had taken over the island in 1895 after defeating the qing dynasty in the first sinojapanese war more than 200 , 000 taiwanese served in the japanese army during world war ii when chiang s kuomintang took control of taiwan after the war , it had little interest in the experience of its people during the war , particularly the suffering caused by its american allies , scholars say seventy years and the end of authoritarian rule on taiwan have done little to change that attitude the communist party was fighting a guerrilla war behind the lines how is it that they came to represent china s antijapanese struggle \? so the kuomintang has struggled for this history , said chen yishen , a historian at academia sinica , a statefinanced research institution in taipei but this is out of touch with taiwan it s the kuomintang s past glory what about what happened to us then in taiwan \? jihchang lee , a retired philosophy professor , described his memories of the taipei air raid in a newly published memoir as a child , he had been relocated from taipei in the final months of the war because of the allied bombing but a younger sister stayed behind after the american b24s dropped their payloads on the afternoon of may 31 , 1945 , mr lee s father rushed back to the house , on what is now taiyuan street in taipei he gathered others to dig through the rubble , but they were only able to clear it hours later , after the cries of the victims had stopped after the war ended , i came back and saw the destruction and the place where my sister was killed , mr lee said in an interview that street had houses on both sides originally there were twostory buildings , but they were completely gone the estimated death toll of 3 , 000 was small compared with the more than 40 , 000 killed in britain during the blitz , or the hundreds of thousands of japanese killed when tokyo was firebombed and atomic bombs were dropped on hiroshima and nagasaki but it was a traumatic event for taiwan , injuring more than 10 , 000 and damaging important buildings like the japanese governorgeneral s office , now the presidential office building the war diary of adm chester nimitz , commanderinchief of the united states pacific fleet , noted that 116 b24s dropped 316 tons of ordnance in the attack on taipei , then known by the japanese name of taihoku the bombs that hit the nearby town of yilan that day achieved good destruction , the diary said unexploded bombs continue to be found to this day in taipei , a potentially lethal reminder of the buried history there are still hidden stories that need more telling , said rana mitter , a professor of history at the university of oxford and author of the book forgotten ally china s world war ii \( outside the united states , it is titled china s war with japan , 19371945 \) it is a worthwhile thing that greater china s contribution to the war against japan is recalled proportionally on both sides of the taiwan strait it s not as if it hasn t been addressed , but broadly speaking , there hasn t been enough attention paid to the indigenous story of what happened in taiwan sun lihchyun , a spokesman for the executive branch of taiwan s government , said that while none of the official events to mark the end of the war will specifically focus on the taipei air raid , it will be discussed during memorial activities on may 31 , scholars held a panel discussion and civil society groups organized a memorial event on ketagalan boulevard , across from the presidential office building but mr chen , the historian , lamented that there was no official remembrance or memorial for the dead in taiwan , there s talk of transitional justice , but it s not complete , he said the ghosts can t leave an event commemorating taiwan s war dead was held in taipei on may 31 follow austin ramzy on twitter at austinramzy
athens a bomb went off outside the offices of a greek business federation in the heart of athens early on tuesday , causing damage but no injuries , the police said it was the first such attack under the country s leftistled government , fueling fears of a possible resurgence of domestic terrorism the blast occurred shortly after 3 30 am on a small , narrow street not far from parliament and nestled in the capital s tourist center investigators were at the scene before the explosion because an anonymous caller had telephoned a warning to two leftleaning newspapers 40 minutes earlier , according to a police official who spoke on the condition of anonymity , as is customary for the police in  the force of the explosion blew out the windows of several buildings , including the cypriot embassy , which closed for the day , and a hotel , which evacuated guests from rooms overlooking the street before the blast a police official said the bomb had been placed in a black backpack and planted outside the building housing the hellenic federation of enterprises , which represents s large businesses bomb disposal experts collected the fragments of the device for analysis , and the road was cordoned off for several hours as police officers scoured the scene for clues that could lead to the perpetrators there was no immediate claim of responsibility for the explosion , which resembled similar attacks carried out by greek guerrilla organizations attacks on business and political targets are not unusual in greece and have peaked in recent years after the onset of the country s financial crisis in 2010 the attacks are usually symbolic protests and are not intended to cause injuries , hence the anonymous warnings that often precede them but tuesday s explosion was the first since the leftist came to power in january on a pledge to fight austerity , before reversing course and after signing greece s third international bailout jailed members of greek domestic guerrilla groups and selfproclaimed anarchists frequently rail against the tough conditions of the country s bailout agreements with international creditors in statements posted online , accusing successive governments of protecting banks and business interests at the expense of greek workers and the unemployed a government spokeswoman , olga gerovasili , condemned tuesday s blast and called for calm at a critical time for greece , which has entered a new round of negotiations with its creditors on a new set of austerity measures linked to the third bailout the absolute condemnation of such acts , especially at this time , without dangerous interpretations , is the advisable political position , ms gerovasili said on monday , eurozone finance ministers approved the release of 2 billion euros , or about 212 billion , in rescue loans to greece after the authorities legislated a raft of economic changes , including stricter rules for the protection of overly indebted homeowners greece has also met the conditions to unlock up to 10 billion that has been set aside for the recapitalization of greece s four biggest banks , eurozone officials said greek authorities have indicated that less than 6 billion will be needed , because banks have already raised a significant amount of private capital

london beware the old italian who speaks with pessimism about facing a team like barcelona but whose eyes burn with a piercing intensity this is a step we wanted to take with all our hearts , said gianluigi buffon , the captain , goalkeeper and elder statesman of , after his team knocked out last year s winner , , from the champions league in the santiago bernab u on wednesday night but , buffon added , unfortunately at the end of it we face a really outstanding barcelona , a team in my opinion that is physically and mentally stronger than ours in victory , he managed to look doleful , almost fearful if i'm not mistaken , the italians said something similar going into their 2006 world cup final against france it was in the same stadium in berlin where the champions league final will be held june 6 buffon , now 37 , made an incredible save in that world cup against zinedine zidane before the french player was goaded into the head butt that infamously got him red carded in the final , effectively handing the title to italy another juventus veteran , andrea pirlo , took the first penalty kick in the shootout that won italy that world cup pirlo , who turns 36 next week , is expected to retire after the final in berlin in june there is an obvious truth in the words of buffon about facing lionel messi , luis su rez and neymar however , he faced down cristiano ronaldo , karim benzema and gareth bale on wednesday , and while none of those three were in top form , it still took a penalty kick for them to score wednesday showed that teamwork and a committed defense can defeat the world s most celebrated individuals , and that will likely remain the key in the final against barcelona , too and juventus , led by its keeper , has an exceptional team ethic it blends the veterans \( not just the italians , but others like carlos tevez and patrice evra \) with hungry young talents like lvaro morata and paul pogba never go back , they say well , buffon and pirlo will relish returning to the scene of their greatest triumph in berlin pogba , who was colossal in midfield against madrid even though he was just returning from a sevenweek absence due to a thigh injury , set up the goal against real when he outjumped sergio ramos and headed the ball down to morata , who drove it down into the ground and beyond iker casillas casillas , real s captain , aspired many years ago to be a goalkeeper like buffon the two have played a combined 280 games for their clubs in european competition , though it is quite possible that casillas has now played his last for real morata grew up with real madrid before the club discarded him last year so the almost apologetic look he gave on wednesday , just as he did in italy a week before , was somewhat like the appearance buffon gave when he pleaded that juventus was humble and just grateful to be part of the spectacle against a spanish giant like madrid it is a mask , hiding the true ambition to take down the opposition , one by one buffon is the goalkeeper who cost juventus 50 million back in 2001 and remained faithful to the club after it was sent down to serie b after a matchfixing scandal in 2006 buffon , still the captain of the italian national team , comes from a town in northern italy whose motto translates as my strength is the wheel and no matter what he says , he is intent on taking this unforeseen opportunity to win soccer s most coveted prize in club play can it happen \? not if barcelona is firing on all cylinders but juventus , known as the old lady , has just shown that if every man on its team shows his best and their opponents do not , then anything can happen that is the attraction of sports the beauty , sometimes laced by the beast when a young morata stepped back into the bernab u on tuesday , he made his way across the tunnel before the game to hug old friends on the other side one of those , ramos , understood the emotion but was wary of the outcome in the history of football , ramos later said , you get cases like morata coming back in the day i was hoping he would not have his best game here , but football presents these opportunities he is a young guy who grew up here , he is a madrid fan , but he also wanted to be in berlin morata tried not to say anything disrespectful or even faintly vengeful but in dedicating his goal to his family , his girlfriend and the fans who applauded him , he added also to my agent , who was tough last summer the agent , who negotiated his move from madrid to juventus , stood firm against a clause that real wanted in the contract a line that would have barred morata from playing against his former team in the champions league that clause was deleted , and so is real madrid now there remains , however , a line that says madrid has first refusal if juventus should agree to sell morata at some time in the future in the history of soccer , these things happen
in june , was shot dead on a monday afternoon in evanston , ill , a suburb 10 miles north of chicago the evanston police believe that the victim , ray c owens , had also been robbed there were no witnesses to his killing , and no surveillance footage either with a killer on the loose and few leads at their disposal , investigators in cook county , which includes evanston , were encouraged when they found two smartphones alongside the body of the deceased an iphone 6 running on s ios 8 operating system , and a samsung galaxy s6 edge running on s android operating system both devices were passcode protected an illinois state judge issued a warrant ordering apple and google to unlock the phones and share with authorities any data therein that could potentially solve the murder apple and google replied , in essence , that they could not because they did not know the user s passcode the homicide remains unsolved the killer remains at large until very recently , this situation would not have occurred last september , apple and google , whose operating systems are used in 96 percent of smartphones worldwide , announced that they had reengineered their software with fulldisk encryption , and could no longer unlock their own products as a result according to apple s on devices running ios 80 apple will not perform ios data extractions in response to government search warrants because the files to be extracted are protected by an encryption key that is tied to the user s passcode , which apple does not possess a google spokeswoman , keys are not stored off of the device , so they cannot be shared with law enforcement now , on behalf of crime victims the world over , we are asking whether this encryption is truly worth the cost between october and june , 74 iphones running the ios 8 operating system could not be accessed by investigators for the manhattan district attorney s office despite judicial warrants to search the devices the investigations that were disrupted include the attempted murder of three individuals , the repeated sexual abuse of a child , a continuing sex trafficking ring and numerous assaults and robberies criminal defendants have caught on recently , a suspect in a manhattan felony , speaking on a recorded jailhouse call , noted that apple and google came out with these softwares that the police cannot easily unlock apple , google and other proponents of fulldisk encryption have offered several rationales for this new encryption technology they have the new policy as a response to the concerns raised by edward j snowden about data collection by the national security agency they say fulldisk encryption makes devices generally more secure from cybercrime and they assert that , if the companies had master encryption keys , then repressive governments could exploit the keys these reasons should not be accepted at face value the new apple encryption would not have prevented the nsa s mass collection of phonecall data or the interception of telecommunications , as revealed by mr snowden there is no evidence that it would address institutional data breaches or the use of malware and we are not talking about violating civil liberties we are talking about the ability to unlock phones pursuant to lawful , transparent judicial orders in the united states , britain , france , spain and other democratic societies , the legal system gives local law enforcement agencies access to places where criminals hide evidence , including their homes , car trunks , storage facilities , computers and digital networks carved into the bedrock of each of these laws is a balance between the privacy rights of individuals and the public safety rights of their communities for our investigators to conduct searches in any of our jurisdictions , a local judge or commissioner must decide whether good cause exists none of our agencies engage in bulk data collection or other secretive practices we engage in targeted requests for information , authorized after an impartial , judicial determination of good cause , in which both proportionality and necessity are tested it is this workable balance that proscribes the operations of local law enforcement in our cities , and guides our residents in developing their expectations of privacy but in the absence of laws that keep pace with technology , we have enabled two silicon valley technology companies to upset that balance fundamentally the evanston case is just one example in france , smartphone data was vital to the swift investigation of the charlie hebdo terrorist attacks in january , and the deadly attack on a gas facility at saintquentinfallavier , near lyon , in june and on a daily basis , our agencies rely on evidence lawfully retrieved from smartphones to fight sex crimes , child abuse , cybercrime , robberies or homicides fulldisk encryption significantly limits our capacity to investigate these crimes and severely undermines our efficiency in the fight against terrorism why should we permit criminal activity to thrive in a medium unavailable to law enforcement \? to investigate these cases without smartphone data is to proceed with one hand tied behind our backs the new encryption policies of apple and google have made it harder to protect people from crime we support the privacy rights of individuals but in the absence of cooperation from apple and google , regulators and lawmakers in our nations must now find an appropriate balance between the marginal benefits of fulldisk encryption and the need for local law enforcement to solve and prosecute crimes the safety of our communities depends on it
in april 2011 , the editors of disunion , the new york times s series on the civil war , convened a panel of historians to mark the 150th anniversary of the confederate assault on fort sumter and the onset of the fouryear conflict before a soldout audience at the times center in new york city , the panelists david blight , ken burns , adam goodheart and jamie malanowski discussed the origins of the conflict , the role of slavery and the immense challenges facing a stillnew president four years later , with the anniversary of appomattox behind us , the times has reconvened the same panelists virtually , this time to bring the series to a close using questions posed by readers and facebook fans , disunion asked them to consider the meaning of the war , its consequences and its legacy 1 what were the two or three biggest mistakes made by jefferson davis \? david blight , professor of history , yale university there is a case that davis made big mistakes in not developing a better tax policy for the confederacy , although he surely did work to great ends to develop a centralized federal government , ironically thwarting or ignoring so much of the states rights doctrine on which his government was founded the cotton embargo may also have been in the long run a big mistake , although that was not all davis s doing but as a longterm historical mistake or perhaps more of an embarrassment i would rank davis s publication of his memoir in 1881 as a genuine low point in the development of his legacy the twovolume , 1 , 279page rise and fall of the confederate government is perhaps the longest , most turgid and most selfrighteous defense of a failed political movement ever written by an american the book is hundreds of pages of vindication for the confederacy , for the slaveholders republic he led , and for the right of secession the book also stands as one of the most open and aggressive defenses of slavery written by a former confederate although davis went to great length to argue that slavery was in no wise the cause of the conflict , but only an incident , he nevertheless provided a thorough version of the alleged mental and historical inferiority of black people american slaves african ancestors , argued davis , were born the slaves of barbarian masters , untaught in all the useful arts and occupations , reared in heathen darkness in america they had been enlightened by the rays of christianity , taught the arts of peace , order and civilization by their new masters this world of contented faithful service , a happier dependence of labor and capital than realized anywhere else in the world , had all been crushed by yankee armies and industry davis thus gave the lost cause its fundamental lifeblood faithful black slaves and heroic , victimized white southerners who in their noble exercise of sovereign rights had tried to hold back the ravages of the yankee leviathan it would be ahistorical to simply wish davis had not written such a defense of the confederate cause but it is always fascinating to witness a colossal tragedy and failure all but unwittingly defended ken burns , documentary filmmaker i think the biggest mistake that jefferson davis made was being on the wrong side but it wasn t so much the mistake that jefferson davis made but the very configuration of the confederacy that was central to its defeat a defeat blamed on davis the politician rather than on the celebrated generals davis had to manage the loose confederation of states when he needed a strong federal government as lincoln had the prosecution of the war was impossible for davis under those circumstances adam goodheart , director of the cv starr center for the study of the american experience at washington college jefferson davis s first mistake of the war was also his biggest the decision to open fire on fort sumter in april 1861 , thus taking upon the new confederacy the responsibility for the civil war s first shot by doing so , he created for the union a moment much like pearl harbor or 9 11 , when the nation rallied together in the face of a shocking attack , setting aside previous political differences to avenge the awful sight of the american flag going down amid smoke and flames he badly underestimated the impact this would have on northern public opinion , especially at a moment when new technologies like the telegraph and steampowered printing spread descriptions and images of the attack throughout the union almost immediately davis might easily have waited the new confederacy faced no real threat from the tiny union garrison just five dozen soldiers and a brass band on a twoacre island , hemmed in on all sides by thousands of rebel troops and abraham lincoln was clearly loath to open hostilities himself the worst thing davis could say about the sumter garrison , in a private letter just a few days before the attack , was that its existence irritate s the people of these confederate states had davis instructed rebel commanders to hold their fire , he not only would have avoided the blame for starting the war , but could also have embraced the opportunity to make his government appear moderate and reasonable to the northern public and foreign powers he could have taken additional time to establish the authority of confederate rule and the apparatus of government currency , a postal system , custom houses , courts throughout the south a smarter strategist might have maneuvered us authorities into effectively treating the confederacy as a foreign power in negotiating sumter s fate all of this would have advanced the rebels true strategic interest , which was not to kill yankees but rather to establish the confederate states of america as a legitimate national power in short , davis made a mistake that lincoln would never have he let a purely symbolic irritant determine the course of national policy the rebel forces 34hour artillery barrage at fort sumter killed not a single yankee but it may have cost the newborn confederacy its life jamie malanowski , author of commander will cushing daredevil hero of the civil war many people believe that davis s biggest mistake was to start the war true enough , by reacting to lincoln s plan to resupply the garrison at fort sumter by opening fire , davis lost any claim to reasonableness , alienated northerners who didn t care if the south stayed or left , and fired up the union cause but the bigger mistake , the tragic mistake , was in thinking , like the rest of the secessionists , that the confederacy could ever win the war at the time the war began , the confederacy was composed of only seven states by opening fire , davis won his bet that he would draw virginia , north carolina , tennessee and arkansas to his side , but he was wrong about maryland and kentucky the confederacy was ill equipped for war it had a much smaller population than the north , and lacked foundries and railroads davis might have sensed that he was being delusional when he appointed a secretary of the navy , even though the south had no ships moreover , the south was hardly unified tens of thousands of former slaves eventually fought for the union , but 100 , 000 white southerners did as well southern armies consistently lacked ammunition , equipment and , most seriously , food , primarily because plantation owners kept producing cotton instead of corn most seriously , davis , like most secessionists , simply underestimated the resolve of the north to preserve the union davis and his fellow secessionists invited the war , and reaped the whirlwind 2 who was the most effective military leader of the civil war \? burns we celebrate the daring and genius of many southern generals , including robert e lee , stonewall jackson and nathan bedford forrest but they were in essence the last vestige of an old order the new order was best represented by very middleclass \( rather than aristocratic \) military men , particularly ulysses s grant and william tecumseh sherman though sherman is hated in the south , and a good deal of that hatred has migrated north , he was by far the most effective leader of the civil war , bringing the war to the industrial centers of the south , ie , the plantations malanowski let s raise a glass to gen winfield scott though seemingly something of a comical figure , the aged , infirm scott devised the strategy of strangulating the southern economy with a total blockade of the southern coast , while using a joint armynavy force to capture the mississippi and sever the confederacy in two at first it was derided for its passivity it wasn t called the anaconda as a compliment but it worked although many blockade runners successfully eluded navy vessels , southern commerce was reduced to a tenth of prewar levels the southern economy could not supply the food it needed to feed its people , let alone the weapons and supplies needed to sustain a war 3 notwithstanding the muchcelebrated emancipation proclamation , was the end of slavery not accomplished by the slaves themselves , by refusing to remain slaves whenever the presence of union forces made this possible \? blight we have almost worn this question out the answer should be and always has been that emancipation was both the result of lincoln s emancipation proclamation \( the policy \) and the brave volition and actions of the slaves themselves \( the process \) history can never be as simple as sometimes we would like it to be eitheror history simply does not work in this instance the crooked path to the proclamation during 186162 , its roots in republican party ideology , in congressional measures such as the second confiscation act and in hugely important military events such as the battle of antietam all this is crucial to understanding how lincoln ends up delivering the executive order to the armed forces to free all slaves in the states in rebellion by january 1863 but the thousands of individual decisions by slaves themselves , who were at least in proximity to the union forces , to strike out for their own liberation are equally important the very term selfemancipation has sometimes been forced to carry too much weight and significance it is simply too operatic this dual story needs to be seen through real evidence , real stories on the ground during the war there are thousands of such cases well documented in the documentary history of emancipation volumes published over the years at the university of maryland but as a streamlined way into understanding how emancipation came about , see my book a slave no more , which reprints the postwar memoirs of two former slaves , john washington and wallace turnage in each case , these former slaves would never have achieved their freedom without their own cunning and extraordinary courage but they also would never have become free without the presence of the union army along the rappahannock river in april 1862 \( washington s case \) and the union navy in mobile bay in august 1864 \( turnage s case \) willing or unwilling , union soldiers and sailors helped to free thousands of slaves who were already risking everything to free themselves goodheart in early 1861 , lincoln and nearly all other white northern leaders and most of the general public wanted to avoid the slavery issue as much as possible it seemed much safer to frame the struggle in terms of southern treason and the union s survival it was enslaved africanamericans themselves who forced ending slavery onto the union s wartime agenda the most dramatic single event occurred on the night of may 23 , 1861 , when three virginia slaves frank baker , shepard mallory and james townsend escaped across the james river and sought asylum with us forces by declaring them contraband of war and offering his protection , gen benjamin f butler placed the federal government in the role of liberator this was a revolutionary change , since throughout its previous existence us authority had protected slaveholding as a constitutional right soon , thousands more escapees were pouring into the union lines and becoming the yankees only reliable allies in the otherwise hostile south this eventually made lincoln s emancipation proclamation appear not just politically acceptable to millions of northern whites , but even historically inevitable to give the confederates their due , they also did their part to hasten the day of jubilee albeit inadvertently when leaders like vice president alexander stephens declared slavery the cornerstone of the confederacy s existence , they more or less acknowledged that union forces could undermine the rebellion by freeing the slaves increasingly as the war went on , northern leaders , ordinary soldiers and the general public found that a pretty tough invitation to resist 4 how different was andrew johnson s reconstruction strategy from the one lincoln would have likely employed had he lived to complete his second term \? blight to answer and understand this question would take pages but a quick way to grasp how different johnson s policy was is to concentrate on the period from midsummer to december 1865 during this period , with congress out of session , johnson engineered a process by which the exconfederate states were allowed to take back control , practically overnight , of their state governments and of their societies generally they passed the infamous black codes , restricting movement , economic activity and any civil or political rights for the freedmen they also restored exconfederates to power and office johnson s approach to reconstruction was rooted in a few fundamental ideas states rights , white supremacy and rapid presidential control over the readmission of southern states to the union his philosophy about reconstruction was often summed up in a slogan he adopted the constitution as it is and the union as it was we cannot know precisely , of course , how lincoln would have done all of this differently what we do know is that he had at least signaled some support for black suffrage , and he was a far more adroit politician than johnson , a great deal more skilled in dealing with friends or enemies in congress it is worth remembering that johnson was not a republican he was an old jacksonian democrat , placed on the presidential ticket in 1864 because of his loyal unionism from a seceded state during the war and it is worth concentrating on why , for very good reasons , the congressional republicans wrested control of reconstruction away from johnson in 1866 burns president johnson was a reluctant reconstructionist , a pale diet version of the one lincoln would have likely employed he was tentatively carrying out his dead predecessor s wishes and into the vacuum of his ambivalence was driven the wedge that would ultimately help cause reconstruction to collapse malanowski i don t know about policies , but it would have been interesting to see if lincoln s personal qualities his magnanimity , intelligence , empathy , personal warmth and his gifts of language and politics would have allowed him to make a connection with ordinary southerners and bring about genuine reconstruction sadly , it s possible that the task would have overwhelmed anyone , and left lincoln with a diminished reputation 5 since the end of the civil war , the united states went on steadily to become a global power , while europe went in the opposite direction can you comment on the effect of the post civil war united states in the geopolitical configuration of the world \? burns in very simple geopolitical terms , the paradox of the civil war is clear it made a diverse collection of states one thing , a nation before the war , when speaking about our country americans said , the united states are , plural after the war , we began to say , as we do today , united states is , which is actually ungrammatical that one thing would within 50 to 75 years be the most powerful country on earth , freed seemingly forever from the sectarian divisions that had driven it to civil war europe , with its long history of separate nationalities , its cultural and linguistic differences , couldn t keep up even its modernday attempt at union is beset by problems and divisions from all corners malanowski i think you would have a hard time convincing queen victoria or winston churchill or otto von bismarck or vladimir lenin or almost any european that europe declined vis a vis the united states at any point prior to the catastrophe of world war ii it s much more interesting to consider how the postcivil war united states would have declined if the south had won the war had secession succeeded , it s easy to imagine other states and sections breaking away , leaving north america like 18th century europe , a continent of smallish nations of competing interests and ideologies , vying for and going to war over land and resources powerful european nations like france and spain would have tried to retrieve old possessions , inviting britain and other powers to tamper as well and even with the federal armies defeated , it is hard to imagine that millions of southern slaves would have docilely accepted their crushed hopes north america would have been a constant war zone , and the wealth and prosperity and power enjoyed by a stable united states during the last 150 years would have been squandered in war and competition 6 how do you envisage the civil war s bicentennial being commemorated in 50 years time \? both within the academic world of civil war scholars and within the wider american political and public spheres \? where do you see the future of the civil war heading in these arenas \? blight at various gatherings and panels this past spring commemorating the ending of the civil war , this question would often emerge in some form the real answer is , of course , none of us know it would be too easy to predict that the lost cause and neoconfederate memory will have eroded much more , if not even died out but i rather doubt that as long as we have a politics of race in america we will have a politics of civil war memory , and therefore the lost cause will have salience it certainly still does in america s rightwing politics i suspect that the roiling salience of federalism , the battles over states rights that are so persistent in our political culture today , will still be around in some form but events determine these matters , over and over the only thing we might be certain of is that if as a world community , as a species , we do not do something serious and soon to reduce greenhouse gases , and therefore stop global warming , then the commemoration of the civil war in 2061 will likely not be held in charleston to remember fort sumter , because that city may be under the sea perhaps , ironically , by 2061 we will have a new lost cause with which to contend the long , failed effort to thwart the power and greed of climate change deniers why is it that only dystopian projections come to mind in relation to this counterfactual question , and very few resembling their opposites \? but to offer something uplifting let s all hope that the 14th amendment survives the next 50 years , that the right to vote for every american , rooted so deeply in the blood of the civil war , will not be further eroded by one of our political party s desperation to survive , that we can somehow imagine a politics that will revive faith in that federal government saved in the war of 186165 , and that the disasters that will be necessary to force us to rebuild our national infrastructure will not be too terrible burns i believe that the civil war s centrality will never diminish as long as the united states survives fifty years from now at the bicentennial , both the academy and the wider public will marvel at how important the civil war was and is to almost every aspect of american life goodheart i hope i ll still be around to see the start of the bicentennial i ll be 90 years old then , so my own lifetime will cover nearly half the distance between the 1860s \( a past that we think of as distant \) and the 2060s \( a future that still feels remote \) the civil war , in other words , will still be barely two lifespans away in biological terms , that s the merest blip yet our pathetic human concept of what constitutes a long time unlike our idea of a long distance seems only to have shrunk during the modern era something tells me that this may start changing in the next 50 years , as the cycles of climates , species and technologies come to overshadow those of wars and presidencies centuries and millennia may \( again \) loom larger than years and decades as the significant units of historical and political time so i ll make a wild bet that in 2061 , the civil war may actually feel less distant than it does now does that mean it will seem more important , or less \? hard to say but i m guessing it will increasingly be seen as a signal modernizing and liberalizing moment not just for the united states , but also for the world other major developments of the 1850s and 1860s darwinism , digital communications , mass media , consumerism , new ideas about gender and sexuality , the rise of european nationstates , the end of russian serfdom , the vast upheavals in china , india , and japan may get smooshed together with the american civil war into one big story , the story of how one version of human society yielded way to another the full consequences of that painful and joyous revolution , that fiery jubilee , may be clearer to everyone in 50 years time than they are now a safer bet is to predict that the story , or stories , of 186165 will continue to enthrall and infuriate us , unite and divide us certain episodes in history are like great books they can be endlessly read , reread , retold and reinterpreted the ancient greeks iliad hasn t gone stale after more than a hundred generations , and there s no reason to expect that our american iliad will do so after just another two malanowski americans don t have much interest in history generally , and less interest in the civil war than they used to this is particularly true in the south , where even those who still take pride in a defiant rebel yell find the legacy of slavery and segregation increasingly an embarrassment consider this in february 1961 , 100 , 000 people , most of them ardent segregationists , showed up in montgomery , ala , to mark the centennial of jefferson davis s inauguration in charleston sc , in december 2010 , about 400 people showed up for a secession ball we still battle with many of the same issues that brought about the civil war , and perhaps will continue to do so in 2061 but an increasingly diverse , multiethnic america will find itself celebrating the south that produced elvis presley and martin luther king jr , eudora welty and tennessee williams , peyton manning and muhammad ali , bb king and johnny cash , cocacola and whoever invented barbecue all pillars of modern

chicago after two dispiriting losses to the mets , the returned to the friendly confines of wrigley field for a workout monday , and in something of a surprise , there was not a penguin or a cockatoo wandering around the clubhouse nor was there a mariachi band to improve the mood or a magician to make the team s lengthy curse \( or the mets' daniel murphy \) disappear then again , there is always tuesday you never really know with the cubs' manager , joe maddon , who has dug into his voluminous bag of psychological tools as heartily in his first season here as he did during his years managing underfunded , overachieving tampa bay teams the object , then and now , is to create a sunnysideup environment it s a tensionfree kind of a game , said maddon , whose clubhouses have in the past featured , and , yes , , as well as so anything i can do to promote that , that s what i attempt to do i really think to bring out the best in your group , the best thing to do is to somehow get them to be able to relax and think in the moment and be mentally relaxed that is my biggest concern , always at the moment , the cubs have plenty of others , too they not only are in a twogamestonone hole in the national league championship series but also have lost with their top two pitchers , jon lester and jake arrieta , on the mound now , they have the daunting task of beating the mets' ace , jacob degrom , who outpitched clayton kershaw and zack greinke , arguably baseball s two best starters this season , in a division series win over the los angeles dodgers and the cubs have yet to figure out a way to cool off murphy in circumstances like these especially for a franchise like the cubs , who have not reached a world series since 1945 and not won one since 1908 it is easy for players and coaches to feel the anxiety of a city when two of maddon s predecessors , dusty baker and lou piniella , took the cubs to the playoffs , they asked fans not to put too big a burden on the players maddon has welcomed the pressure , insisting that even if the cubs arrived at this stage sooner than some expected , it was not a surprise to him listen , they beat us , but it s not nearly over with , and we are really good , maddon said , pointing to the phrase now attached to the team on twitter , wearegood maddon added , i have a lot of faith in our guys catcher david ross said the positive environment had been in place since spring training , and it perhaps helps explain why maddon can stick kris bryant , typically a third baseman , and kyle schwarber , primarily a catcher in the minors , in the outfield while giving them the confidence not to worry about their inexperience there i really believe winning is a skill , said ross , 38 , who won a world series with boston you learn how to win , and you figure those things out how to have that personality when things are going really bad we play so many games , and especially in a sevengame series , i do n't think we 're going to have any kind of letdown the only thing now , being down two games , is just staying positive if things do n't go our way maddon has long believed the mental component of baseball is a sixth tool , alongside the traditional five hitting for average , hitting for power , running , fielding and throwing in our game , maddon said , with all the breaks and pauses , what do you do with them mentally , and how do you focus in the moment without letting your mind wander off into those bad reaches \? in the mid1980s , when maddon was a minor league field coordinator for the angels , he met doug larish , then a professor at arizona state , and persuaded the angels to invite larish to minor league spring training to evaluate how the coaches were teaching he s very openminded and progressive , said larish , whose son jeff reached the major leagues he s been very willing to think outside the box too often , larish found , coaches knew the points they wanted to get across to players but had a hard time doing so for instance , a coach might tell a hitter that 70 percent of his weight should be on his back foot and 30 percent on his front foot how does a player judge that \? larish said he does n't have scales under his feet while the information is correct , it s presented in an ambiguous way maddon said you have to imagine the middle '80s it was where did he play \? what has he done \? ' all these ridiculous comments and my point was always , it s no different than a hitting coach or a pitching coach he s trying to teach you a skill around the same time , maddon came across another academic , ken ravizza , a sports psychology professor at california state , fullerton ravizza , who has worked with various college baseball and football teams , as well as the jets , later wrote the book headsup baseball playing the game one pitch at a time ravizza has been a consultant for the rays and the cubs joe creates an environment where people can be themselves and play their game , ravizza said it s very important to be able to relax and be focused on what you need to do and not make it bigger than it is , and joe creates a culture that encourages that so after , 41 , on sunday night , music pulsed through the clubhouse , just as it always does maddon had the theme from rocky blaring rocky' did set a great example in 1976 for all of us , maddon said so when you get behind the eight ball a little bit , sometimes you just go pound on some big slabs of beef in the cooler , and obviously you come back , and you 're fine when it was pointed out to maddon that rocky lost the title bout in that first movie , he shrugged it was just about the effort , maddon said he came back he came back the cubs hope they can do the same
florham park , nj brandon marshall has never been to the nfl playoffs , and he may not go this season even if win their final two games but marshall , perhaps more than any jet , understands the fine line that separates success and failure in the league and what it feels like to be on the wrong side of it with two games left in the regular season , need substantial help to reach the playoffs at a minimum , they need wins in those last two games , starting with sunday s against  for marshall , that makes the game the most important one of his career yes , absolutely , he said because it s the next one what amazes many young players who enter the nfl is not so much the accelerated speed of the game but the virtually nonexistent margin for error if you look at most games , you 're talking about the difference in a game is about two plays , jets linebacker demario davis told me earlier in the season that s a couple of dozen plays a season a tackle made or missed a yard gained , or allowed a fumble a catch a drop those vital few plays added together none of them necessarily judged as seasondefining moments at the time are usually the difference , davis said , between first place and last for marshall , another matchup with the has him thinking about one play in particular the jets' 3023 loss at new england in october seems like a lifetime ago but tucked inside it is a moment that still haunts him the jets led by 1716 early in the fourth quarter and had driven to the patriots' 12yard line on a thirdand7 with just under 13 minutes to play , marshall dropped a tough but for someone of his stature catchable backshoulder pass in the end zone that would have padded the jets' slim lead instead , they settled for a field goal the patriots , granted a reprieve , scored touchdowns on their next two drives and won the game marshall berated himself on twitter saying he should be after the way he had played but said the missed opportunity would be my fuel to get better that certainly seems to have been the case marshall has n't dropped much this season and on saturday pushed his receiving total beyond 1 , 200 yards this week , he was named to the pro bowl for the sixth time in 10 seasons but he is still looking for his first postseason experience if he and the jets do n't get there , they can look at the handful of plays or coaching decisions that will have kept them out their first loss of the season came in week 3 , at home against philadelphia , as ryan fitzpatrick threw three interceptions and the eagles' darren sproles returned a punt 89 yards for a touchdown the a month later included not only marshall s pivotal drop but also questionable clock management by the jets' firstyear coach , todd bowles , late in the game , which ended when marshall was called for a false start a bad loss at oakland a week later was distinguished by a gaggle of blunders , and a damaging home loss to buffalo will be remembered for bowles s decision to go for it on a fourthandshort in the closing minutes rather than kick a field goal he then by directing a potential winning pass toward kellen davis , not marshall the jets are closing strong they have won four straight since thanksgiving but it may be too late in a division that has been dominated by new england , five losses , largely determined by a dozen or so bad plays , are more than enough to wreck yet another jets season after the october loss to new england , bowles brushed off any longterm implications by saying , it s one game we 're 42 after the loss to buffalo dropped them to 54 , bowles was asked about the playoff implications and whether another unnecessary loss would finish the team s playoff chances we 're not even thinking playoffs right now , he said at the time it s a long season we 're 54 we 're in the middle of the pack with everybody else the jets followed that up with a loss to houston that dropped their record to 500 only then did bowles address the culture of losing that was suffocating a promising season how does a franchise that has gone without a title for more than 40 years , one that has missed the playoffs the last four seasons , end the cycle \? the way we finish ballgames is to execute and play situational football , bowles said i think once it gets down to the end of the ballgame , there s a bust here or a bust there that we have to get better at and that comes with mental toughness , and that s something that has to be ingrained every year , whether it s a new coach or rather it s the same coach the most consistent nfl franchises live in the moment as they plan for the future but perhaps because of the volatile , highly emotional nature of the game and the short season , in which every game counts , football players and coaches can become so preoccupied by the here and now that many cannot appreciate that what they do in each moment can have a deleterious impact on their teams , their careers and even the course of their franchises yesterday and tomorrow are inextricably linked , one moment at a time the next ones will come sunday and , if the jets can win then , at buffalo on jan 3 but because of missteps they made in the fall , the jets may need a winter miracle to break their playoff drought
camp taji , iraq lt col john schwemmer is here for his sixth deployment maj james modlin is on his fourth sgt maj thomas foos \? it s so many , i would rather not say sir these soldiers are among 300 from the 573 squadron of the 82nd airborne division of the , about half of them trainers , the rest support and force protection stationed at this old iraqi military base 20 miles north of baghdad , they are as close as it gets to american boots on the ground in  back now for the first time since , none of them thought they would be here again , let alone return to find the iraqi army they had once trained in such disrepair colonel schwemmer said he was stunned at the state in which he found the iraqi soldiers when he arrived here it s pretty incredible , he said i was kind of surprised what training did they have after we left \? apparently , not much the current , woeful state of the iraqi military raises the question not so much of whether the americans left too soon , but whether a new round of deployments for training will have any more effect than the last iraq s army looked good on paper when the americans left , after one of the biggest training missions carried out under wartime conditions but after that , senior iraqi officers , paying for them out of the supply , food and payroll money of their troops corruption ran up and down the ranks desertion was rife the army did little more than staff checkpoints then , last year , four divisions collapsed overnight in mosul and elsewhere in northern iraq under the determined assault of islamic state fighters numbering in the hundreds or at most the low thousands , and the extremists' advance came as far as this base an army that once counted 280 , 000 activeduty personnel , one of the largest in the world , is now believed by some experts to have as few as four to seven fully active divisions as little as 50 , 000 troops by some estimates the director of media operations for iraq s ministry of defense , qais alrubaiae , said , however , that even by the most conservative estimates , the army now had at least 141 , 000 soldiers in 15 divisions most of the american soldiers were intimately involved in training iraqi forces before , too when i left in 2009 , major modlin said , they had it , they really did i do n't know what happened after that we used to say that every deployment was different , major modlin said but we quickly found out that this time was completely different from any other time the iraqis know that this time we 're not going to do it for them , and they appreciate that the 300 american soldiers here , with a smaller number of united states marines at al asad air base in anbar province , are the only american soldiers deployed outside baghdad but as the military sees it , they do not count as boots on the ground since their role is purely to train , advise and assist , as authorized in november by president obama in fact , master sgt mike lavigne , a military spokesman \( one tour in iraq and three in afghanistan \) , does not like that term at all we do not have a single boot on the ground , he said really , not one even in a training role , however , this venerable iraqi military base puts american soldiers very close to what passes for a front line in the conflict with the islamic state , also known as or isil from time to time , the extremists lob mortar rounds from their hiding places east of the base , just across the tigris river there is little chance they will hit anything the base is huge , and their aim is as bad as it was in al qaeda s day , when the americans were last here and used it as a major training base nonetheless , no one goes around without body armor on on thursday , the american instructors were leading a livefire exercise , teaching basic smallunit maneuvering while firing at popup targets squadsize groups of iraqi soldiers charged through a scrubbrush field , so realistic fires popped up around them smallunit maneuvering is pretty standard the world over , command sgt maj michael ames said as basic as the training was , many of the trainees even those in the army already more than a year had never experienced it it was a striking departure from the last years of the iraq war , when american and iraqi soldiers were carefully separated at training facilities live ammunition was rarely used when they were together in the latter years of the american presence , for fear of socalled insider attacks , in which soldiers assault their western allies you have to have a level of trust , and we 're with them here , colonel schwemmer said it s the common enemy that ties us together sgt ali mesin hamid , the squad leader , was clearly appreciative we 've never had training this good , he said after his men went through the exercise , exulting at having hit all the targets we 'll be ready for the real fight their american drill instructor , sgt first class james grimes \( four deployments to iraq \) , had a more nuanced view , as he showed the soldiers a sandbox representing the field they had just been on bottle caps stood for each fighter and piles of sand for their firing positions you guys saw how quick you ran out of ammo , right \? he said and they needed to concentrate more on making sure their fields of fire overlapped , covering a broader area than just the targets they could see other than that , pretty good those soldiers were already in their fifth week of a sixweek basic training course some will come back for an additional three weeks in all , 3 , 600 from two iraqi brigades are in the american training program , and 4 , 600 more have graduated late last year with the taji training site running at maximum capacity , as it is now , that means the program will reach at most about 30 , 000 iraqi soldiers by the end of this year , probably far fewer the marines at al asad train smaller numbers of regular soldiers they 're going to leave here trained , colonel schwemmer said but there s a big difference between trained and seasoned whether those who are trained go straight into the fight against the islamic state is not a decision the americans will be part of that , they say , is entirely an iraqi government decision given the shortages of troops in the fight against the islamic state , deployment on the front lines seems pretty likely many of the trainees were relatively new recruits , who had joined straight after the collapse of the military in the face of the islamic state s onslaught in june some had originally joined the popular shiite militias , which are credited with halting the extremists' advance after the military fell apart but they are also blamed for human rights abuses and the deepening rift between sunnis and shiites , which the sunnibased insurgency has exploited ahmed abud hassan , 21 , joined after his cousin at camp speicher was presumably killed among the 1 , 700 prisoners executed there by the islamic state sajad hakim , 21 , had a brother in mosul in the military who was never seen again the two men , shiites from diwaniya , said they eventually chose the military over the militias for one thing , it offered better pay and a pension we 're not going to stop , mr hassan said we 're going to keep fighting in their honor their iraqi regimental commander , maj masar hasim \( six deployments with american soldiers , and three other wars \) , was a veteran of a halfdozen battlefields against the islamic state in the past year , but he said this was the first time his men had received any meaningful training this is a completely different level of training , nothing like what we had before , he said but the iraqi major was cleareyed about their ability and thought it would be a long time before they made a difference in the field if i get 100 good soldiers out of this 400 we have here , i would feel like a king , he said
readers discuss frank bruni s criticism of selfsegregation on diverse campuses to the editor re \( column , dec 13 \) the subtext of frank bruni s complaint about the balkanization of american campuses is that somehow minority students are to blame for what has been called selfsegregation really \? let me revisit two recent incidents that should be quite illuminating the first is the video of oklahoma university fraternity members singing a disgusting , racist ditty the second is the alleged racial ban at a yale fraternity party white girls only these are most assuredly isolated incidents , but snapshots of the separatist tone and tenor of american life in general minority students are not responsible for this dynamic , nor should they be forced to tolerate it the universities cannot prevent such behavior , but they can provide places where minority students will not be subjected to it to suggest otherwise is just another case of kicking the victim vaughn a carney stowe , vt to the editor colleges can achieve diversity with or without affirmative action getting students to accept the challenges that diversity demands is another matter frank bruni seems to envision a onesizefitsall student , a paragon of political correctness , who will spend summers volunteering in other countries and wearing the colors of the rainbow like a suit of armor many will , but there are those who will take the required courses in multiculturalism and then encase themselves in their own parochial cocoon and who is to deny them their right \? in my 50 years as a college professor , i have seen interracial romances blossom i have seen students of different ethnicities bond after working on a joint project i have also seen students isolate themselves in their own secure corner of the classroom , preferring to mingle with no one except their own kind let colleges pursue diversity in their own way , let professors teach their discipline and let students find their own way into this highly complex and marvelously diverse world bernard f dick teaneck , nj to the editor frank bruni is right that a demographically diverse campus does not guarantee meaningful interactions between diverse people but he wrongly claims that affinity groups and safe spaces are troubling concessions to students' desires for selfvalidation at schools like princeton and yale \( where i have spent the last decade \) , a student of color is the only nonwhite person in the room over and over and over again a former student of mine who is black has written that he did n't have a black teacher , ever , until he was 20 students of color at predominantly white institutions are in fact dealing with diversity every day , and not always in enriching ways they need cultural centers and affinity groups not because they want coddling but because they spend their entire lives doing the hard work of engaging with difference , and sometimes they need to be in spaces where they are not outnumbered mr bruni s model of diversity is attuned to the needs and experiences of people in the majority , but it ignores and caricatures the needs of members of minority groups his argument is unwitting evidence that diversity is not an adequate substitute for justice briallen hopper new haven to the editor the selfsegregation found on college campuses today is often a product of the opportunities for livinglearning communities where individuals can elect to live with similarminded students , as mentioned in the article much of the reason , ironically , that growing diversity on campuses is not leading to more integrated campus life is that universities have beat the word diversity over their heads so much that students are frankly sick of hearing about it diversity courses and required sensitivity classes build resentment among students of all colors , as the spoonfed nature of the discussion makes diversity feel like nothing more than a token effort for universities trying to appeal to the liberal elites successfully integrating people of all backgrounds on college campuses will happen only organically men and women of different heritages and socioeconomic backgrounds will discover for themselves what diversity means if given an unimpeded opportunity to explore it themselves johnny hirschauer fairfield , conn to the editor frank bruni decries the failures of colleges and universities in fostering inclusiveness within diversity with the statement , that environment hinges on what happens after admissions he cites problems as well as possible remedies yet the crux of this problem is not what happens after admissions , but what happens before admissions in k12 public education de facto segregated public schools are the breeding ground for continued divisiveness the supreme court got it right in the 1954 brown v board of education ruling that separate educational facilities are unequal that ruling has essentially been undone at the altar of home rule and states' rights we have a public education system based on wealth and housing that continues what was inherently wrong a lack of real equal opportunities and supports for all students within an environment where they could work , play , learn and break bread together that is , know one another jonathan shutman ocean , nj to the editor many years ago i was an interviewer of applicants at wesleyan university white students and those of color both cited the school s diversity as one of their main reasons for wanting to attend essentially , white students wanted to get to know black students , but black students , many of them from largely white high schools , were also applying to connect with other blacks , not necessarily with white students the desire by students of color to create their own vibrant communities within rigorous academic atmospheres should be applauded and respected , not disparaged because they are not meeting mr bruni s hopes for majority \( white \) students to draw greater benefit from campus diversity lazar treschan brooklyn to the editor frank bruni uses the word diversity to apply to defined social groups and to a college s obligation to see that these groups meet and mingle on campus to their mutual advantage what is missing is any sense that these prospective students are unique individuals who may choose to identify with many different social groups or with none at all they are not to be categorized where is the recognition of the incredible diversity of the individual human being \?

he feared his 14yearold son , benjamin , had died after being hit in the head multiple times during a rugby match in which he should have been pulled from the field as a heartbroken mr robinson and his family left the old townhall courthouse in belfast , northern ireland , that day in september 2013 , they were told they could slip out the back to avoid the news media but mr robinson was determined that his son should not die in vain , so he , along with his exwife , karen walton , and their families , exited through the front , spoke to a scrum of reporters and instantly landed among the most vocal advocates for concussion safety standards in britain if we had gone out the back , ben would have died for nothing and nothing would have been learned , mr robinson said , sitting in his home in scotland , a picture of his son in a frame nearby by going out the front , we told people what happened it really kicked off from there within months , mr robinson was meeting with politicians , sports executives , professional athletes and , most important , dr willie stewart , the foremost scientist on the subject in britain who formed a bond with mr robinson that has helped produce some of the most comprehensive concussion guidelines in the world the emotional story of mr robinson s loss wedded to the scientific authority of dr stewart s research led to measures adopted in scotland that apply not just to rugby but to all sports at all levels , from scholastic games to adult leagues , and are now seen as a model for other countries in scotland , unlike the united states , where each sport has tackled the issue on its own and issued varying protocols , aim to protect all amateur athletes and take the guesswork out of assessing potential concussions by calling for players to be removed from the game at the first suspicion of the injury their fight is not over dr stewart laments that much still must be done for athletes who have suffered dementia and other debilitating effects from repeated head trauma , but the pair and their allies have achieved an important start by protecting players on the field now it took something high profile to get people to understand , and it needed something in the media to make people aware , dr stewart said , referring to benjamin s death even if it just means we 're preventing another ben robinson and not addressing dementia , that s still very important we 've got to get things to change it will take time a 23yearold rugby player in england died after absorbing a head injury during a training session on dec 6 the player , , had sustained a couple of other concussions in the past but had taken time off to recuperate much of what mr robinson and dr stewart have accomplished is second nature in the united states , where concussions have been a growing part of the public dialogue for several years coaches and players in many sports are now taught that concussions , brain injuries resulting from a blow to the head or whiplash , can lead to headaches , memory loss , dizziness , sensitivity to light and other problems football and other contact sports like rugby have come under fire as researchers have established links between repeated head hits and the degenerative brain disease known as chronic traumatic encephalopathy , or cte , which has been diagnosed posthumously in dozens of retired players , some of whom committed suicide after an outcry from scientists , retired players and family members of injured and deceased athletes , the nfl and other leagues have adopted protocols during games to detect concussions , pull players from the field , administer onthespot tests and detail when they can return to play leagues have also cut the number of full contact practices , changed game rules to reduce collisions and stiffened penalties for players who take aim at a rival s head even sports not considered full contact have taken steps last month , for instance , the united states soccer federation said it would set on youth players heading the ball other countries are catching up , though until recently , sports leaders in britain where rugby is the biggest full contact sport that is widely played resisted calls for action , saying concussions were an american problem synonymous with football and helmets there was a tendency to ignore it because it was n't in our backyard , said barry o 'driscoll , a former top doctor for world rugby they have been very , very slow in the uk in picking up what has been obvious to an awful lot of medical and rugby people , and certainly in transferring it to coaches , players and parents , which is the bottom line chris nowinski , a cofounder of the concussion legacy foundation , an american nonprofit group that pushes for safe sports , said that concussion management in britain lags five to six years behind the united states the new scottish guidelines , though , are considered a significant leap forward , mr nowinski said scotland is a great example of a team of passionate advocates creating change in their community , he said it s a template that i hope others follow indeed , canadian lawmakers are , named in honor of a teenager who died after sustaining concussions while playing rugby , that includes many of the guidelines introduced in scotland neither mr robinson nor dr stewart had ambitions for such a bold step dr stewart was running one of the world s leading brain banks , assisting an array of researchers who look at brain trauma in carcrash and assault victims and others , but not focused exclusively on concussion in athletes mr robinson lived a quiet suburban life near edinburgh until he got an urgent phone call on jan 29 , 2011 concussions were far from mr robinson s mind when his son joined his teammates from carrickfergus grammar school to play their rivals from dalriada that day as he did before every match that he could not attend , mr robinson gave his son a pep talk on the phone the night before mr robinson lived in scotland and had remarried , but he and his son remained close and shared a love of sports and rugby , kicking a ball back and forth when the boy visited mr robinson returned often to northern ireland , where he grew up and worked , and where his children lived with their mother , karen , and her second husband , steven walton soccer was benjamin s first love , but when he was 11 , he took up rugby , which was mandatory at his new school initially , he did not enjoy the sport but he warmed to it after winning the award for most improved player he did strength and conditioning drills to add muscle , and arm wrestled with his father head trauma was far from mr robinson s mind i had no concerns , he said my biggest fear was a broken neck or bones , not concussions the match that january day was the second round of the medallion shield , a tournament in northern ireland for boys 15 and under dalriada had beaten benjamin s team earlier that season , so payback was a motivation a center , benjamin was a rising star , and he seemed destined to be chosen the next year to compete in the schools cup , a tournament for older boys he led the line when it came to tackling , especially on the day it happened , mr robinson said the night before the game , his son watched invictus , the film about south africa s victory in the 1995 rugby world cup he slept that night in his uniform when his mother dropped him off at the field the next day , benjamin flashed a thumbsup sign ms walton returned later with her husband and quickly recognized that the match was particularly rough the force shocked me , ms walton told the guardian newspaper he seemed to be involved in everything it was just hit after hit after hit at halftime , ms walton told mr walton she thought her son should come out of the game she fought back the urge to speak to benjamin directly because she knew it would embarrass him so mr walton spoke to the referee , who reassured him benjamin was playing well so he played on but just minutes into the second half , benjamin collided with another player , whose shoulder hit him in the chest , according to mr robinson , who obtained a dvd of the match from the police his son s head whipped back , and he fell the coach came to look at benjamin , who was on the ground for about 90 seconds , and helped him to his feet a doctor who was watching his son play for dalriada briefly walked onto the field but then turned back after play resumed , benjamin suffered another big hit this time , he held his head as he walked to the sideline , where the coach gave him a rudimentary test , moving his finger from side to side in front of the boy s face later in the half , benjamin was hit yet again , clutched his head and walked away at the inquest , a teammate said that benjamin told him he did not remember the score \( carrickfergus won , 65 , mr robinson said \) as time ran down , benjamin made a tackle and then collapsed the game was stopped ms walton ran onto the field , where benjamin s teammate told her that he was out cold he was rushed to royal victoria hospital in belfast when mr robinson first got the news by telephone , he thought , he 'll come around he 'll be ok but further calls made the urgency clear , so he rushed to belfast the drive to the airport in edinburgh and the wait for the flight were interminable if i could have hijacked a plane , i would have , peter said when mr robinson and his wife , carol , arrived at the hospital , he knew the situation was dire from the faces of the staff his son was on life support the doctors said that his brain injury looked like it was sustained in a car accident and that he had a slim chance of surviving mr robinson pinched his son s fingers to see if he could get a reaction none came two days later , the doctors determined that benjamin was braindead mr robinson and ms walton agreed that their son s organs would be donated , and he was taken off life support as in other cases involving a minor or an unusual death , an inquest was ordered the preliminary result was that benjamin died from a single hit at the end of the match the conclusion , though , began to unravel about six months later , when the pathologist said that benjamin suffered three brain injuries that very likely occurred on the same day initially , though , a police investigator deferred to the schools when it came to gathering comments from benjamin s teammates and opponents officials at carrickfergus declined to discuss the case according to news reports on the inquest , the coach said that benjamin did not complain of any problems , and the only doctor on the sideline that day , an anesthetist who was there to watch his son , not at the behest of the school , later admitted that he was unprepared to treat  mr robinson did his own research into concussions and learned about secondimpact syndrome , or a rapid and severe swelling of the brain that occurs when someone sustains a second concussion before a first one has properly healed ms walton and mr robinson , though , had to piece together much of what happened on their own one break came while ms walton was visiting her son s grave which she said she did every day and met one of his teammates , who was out jogging he told her that benjamin had been knocked out during the match , not just hit at the end , as had been contended by then , the school and family had hired lawyers frustrated that the police did not obtain any meaningful testimony from the students , the family s lawyer sent letters to parents of the children , one of whom said benjamin had been disoriented on the field the big break came when a police officer gave mr robinson a copy of a video taken of the match by a student mr robinson watched the shaky footage repeatedly and confirmed that his son suffered not one big blow , but at least three , and that the coach attended to him several times i made myself sick , mr robinson said every time i watched it , i found more and more evidence a friend helped mr robinson isolate still shots and slowmotion sequences that were shown at the inquest , which was scheduled for one day but went on for six if we did n't have the video , mr robinson said , it would have been put down as a terrible accident , a oneoff incident in her report released in september 2013 , the coroner said the video was extremely useful and agreed with the pathologist benjamin had died of secondimpact syndrome she also cited testimony of players who had said benjamin could not remember details like the score during the game yet she effectively absolved the coach and referee , who were not made aware of benjamin s neurological complaints , even though the coach can be seen on the video checking on him after a hit during the match she implied that benjamin could have let them know about his condition , even though experts say concussion victims often cannot adequately communicate what they are experiencing the coach , neal kennedy , remains at the school the day the coroner released her report , carol , mr robinson s second wife , saw dr stewart on television explaining the gravity of secondimpact syndrome , so she contacted him for help in understanding the injury after returning to northern ireland , mr robinson wrote to government leaders in scotland to press for change and make sure that this would never happen to another parent soon after , mr and ms robinson , dr stewart and james robson , the chief medical officer of scottish rugby , met with scotland s sport and education officials to lobby for change a concussionawareness leaflet was produced at the beginning of 2014 ben s story gets you through the door , and then the experts can get to work , mr robinson said of his partnership with dr stewart they continue to lobby ministers and sports executives across britain , even speaking at a in april 2014 in london students in schools in northern ireland are now taught how to spot the signs of a concussion it has been an unlikely road for mr robinson and dr stewart , an avid bike rider with no experience as a sideline doctor but about five years ago , even before benjamin s death , dr stewart began to get calls from former professional players and had conversations with scottish rugby as it tried to address brain trauma and degenerative brain disease down the hall from his spartan office in the department of neuropathology at queen elizabeth university hospital in glasgow is a room filled with freezers containing hundreds of brain samples collected over decades in a storeroom nearby , slices of brain samples in lucite fill the shelves dr stewart said he would prefer to spend his time looking at slides of tissue samples under a microscope and writing research reports and while he does not like to speak to the news media , he is aware that knowledge of his research and clinical experience can help coaches and players recognize the dangers of brain injury still , some sports executives have anonymously challenged dr stewart in one match in april in london , oscar , the brazilian star player on chelsea who is known by one name , collided violently with the goalkeeper yet was not immediately taken out of the game there are no concussion spotters at premier league matches , but team and league officials could watch a replay of the game later that is why dr stewart an adviser to the football association was dismayed that oscar was in uniform three days later , violating the league s returntoplay guidelines that require at least six days of rest , he called the decision completely unacceptable that led team officials to complain to local sports reporters that dr stewart had spoken out of turn these incidents , dr stewart said , can be deflating but then he is reminded that he can make a bigger difference not in the professional ranks , where so much money and prestige are at stake , but at the amateur levels i do n't need to stand up in front of a conference of sports medicine and be personally criticized , he said but then i 'll get a call from peter , who is enthused about something we 've done with the leaflets , or some research collaborators who are keen to move forward , and i say , ah , for all the small minds that are critical and obviously trying to deny the inevitable signs , there are a whole bunch of people who are having a positive effect on it' some of the fruits of his work can be found about 90 minutes from glasgow in cupar , near st andrews there , the howe of fife rugby club has gone further than what the scotland protocols call for it has introduced the kingdevick test , an exam given to players to help trainers determine with more specificity whether an athlete is impaired and should be evaluated further by a neuro specialist on a chilly evening in late october , with teenagers practicing on a nearby field , , the club s physical therapist , showed off the test on a tablet computer at the start of the season , hundreds of youth and adult players are timed as they read aloud a series of numbers on several screens if a player is suspected of having a concussion during a match , he or she is taken off and asked to players who take longer are evaluated further if i can say , your brain is functioning six seconds slower , ' they can relate to it , ms brunton said if i can detect a concussion early , i can treat it properly players and parents said the test was not intrusive , and they accepted the need for something that might prevent injuries the issue is taken seriously enough that a local company agreed to cover the cost of the tablets and software license for the test now the awareness is definitely heightening , said catriona nimmo , whose two sons played rugby the test , which is widely used in the united states , is another example of how the grassroots campaign to improve safety standards after benjamin s death has changed attitudes i'm awfully sorry the reason we met is because of ben , dr stewart said of his partnership with mr robinson i get the feeling that some of what we are doing is actually changing and making a difference to people
washington in a perfect world , there would be no nuclear enrichment in iran , and its existing enrichment facilities would be dismantled but we do n't live in a perfect world we ca n't wish or bomb away the basic knowhow and enrichment capability that iran has developed what we can do is sharply constrain it over a long duration , monitor it with unprecedented intrusiveness , and prevent the iranian leadership from enriching material to weapons grade and building a bomb those are the goals that have animated recent american diplomacy on the iranian nuclear issue , including during the backchannel talks with iran that i led in oman and other quiet venues in 2013 against a backdrop of 35 years without sustained diplomatic contact , filled with mutual suspicion and grievance , it was hardly surprising that our discussions were difficult , and our iranian counterparts as toughminded and skeptical as they were professionally skilled but our efforts helped set the stage for the interim agreement , or joint plan of action , concluded in  much maligned at the time , the jpoa has proved its value , freezing and rolling back iran s nuclear program for the first time in a decade , applying innovative inspections measures , allowing only modest sanctions relief and keeping substantial pressure on iran the understanding , switzerland , on thursday is an important step forward many crucial details still have to be resolved but the understanding outlines a solid comprehensive agreement that would increase , for at least a decade , the time it would take iran to enrich enough weaponsgrade material for a single bomb from the current twotothreemonth timeline to at least one year it would significantly reduce iran s stockpile of lowenriched uranium , substantially limit the country s enrichment capacity and constrain iranian research and development on more advanced centrifuges and it would cut off iran s other possible pathways to a bomb , including by effectively eliminating iran s potential capacity to produce weaponsgrade plutonium at its planned arak reactor and banning enrichment at the underground fordow facility for at least 15 years in addition to these significant limitations , we would create an inspection regime unparalleled in intensity , going well beyond current international standards and ensuring that any breakout effort would be quickly detected only a negotiated deal gets us the verification and monitoring we need to close off any covert path to a weapon through carefully phased sanctions relief with builtin procedures to reimpose sanctions immediately in case of iranian noncompliance , we would also preserve ample enforcement leverage with more eyes on less material in fewer places , and clarity about the harsh costs of cheating , we would be well positioned to deter and prevent iranian breakout as consequential as this understanding is , much more remains to be done three challenges loom largest the first is the most obvious and immediate the difficult , painstaking work of negotiating the details of a comprehensive agreement rigorous execution of such an agreement will be a critical priority for this administration and its successor , and that will depend on the quality of its verification and enforcement provisions there is no reason to rush this effort , especially given the continued freeze on iran s program under the jpoa what s crucial is to get it right the second and third challenges are more longterm , but equally important completing this comprehensive nuclear accord with iran must be one part of a cleareyed strategy for a middle east in deep disarray i do not assume that progress on the nuclear issue will lead anytime soon to relaxation of tensions with tehran on other regional problems , or to normalization of united statesiranian relations nor do i assume that the iranian leadership will make an overnight transformation from a revolutionary , regionally disruptive force to a more normal role as another ambitious regional power that means we must work to reassure our partners in the region , whose concerns about both iranian threats and the impact of a nuclear deal are palpable we should urgently pursue new forms of security assurances and cooperation taking a firm stance against threatening iranian actions in the region , from syria to yemen , not only shores up anxious longtime friends it also is the best way to produce iranian restraint , much as a firm stance on sanctions helped persuade iran to reassess its nuclear strategy similarly , it s important to embed a comprehensive iranian nuclear agreement in a wider effort to strengthen the global nuclear order new inspection and monitoring measures applied through an iran agreement may create useful future benchmarks the iranian problem has exposed significant vulnerabilities under the nuclear nonproliferation treaty , especially the absence of a clear divide between civilian and military programs the iran case makes clear that the gray zone in the treaty between the right to use nuclear energy and the prohibition against manufacturing nuclear weapons is too wide as nuclear technology and knowhow become more diffuse and states turn to nuclear power to reduce greenhouse gas emissions , building a sturdy firewall between military and peaceful activities will be an increasingly important task none of this will be easy but the prospect of a comprehensive nuclear agreement with iran in the next few months , if executed rigorously and embedded in wider strategies for regional order and global nuclear order , can be a significant turning point it can also be a muchneeded demonstration of the enduring value of diplomacy the history of the iranian nuclear issue is littered with missed opportunities it is a history in which fixation on the perfect crowded out the good , and in whose rearview mirror we can see deals that look a lot better now than they seemed then with all its inevitable imperfections , we ca n't afford to miss this one
st paul thirtytwo students sat at long tables in a university of st thomas classroom one recent morning , reviewing notes or checking their smartphones , when john tauer walked in tauer wore a purple dress shirt and gray pleated slacks under his black topcoat , but not the tie and blazer he would wear that night for his other job , coaching the st thomas men s basketball team all right , how are we doing today \? tauer said highly motivated \? let s jump right in then and off they went the psychology class , motivation and emotion , explores the motives behind human behavior over the next 65 minutes , tauer , a tenured professor with a doctorate in social psychology from wisconsin , spoke to his students about what drives them to perform the important activities in their lives i'm biased about why motivation is the most fascinating topic , he said most successful coaches are amateur psychologists in one way or another , but trained ones are rare in the ncaa equally rare these days are men s basketball coaches who teach courses , even in division iii recruiting and other obligations leave little time for academic pursuits but tauer , an allconference forward for st thomas in the 1990s and a member of its athletic hall of fame , enjoys teaching so much that he cannot give it up he taught three courses a semester during 11 seasons as a st thomas assistant coach he cut back to one per semester when he succeeded steve fritz upon his retirement as head coach four years ago tauer , 42 , wrote his doctoral dissertation on intrinsic motivation doing something simply for enjoyment , without regard for money or fame or popularity tauer is so well regarded in his field that he contributed regularly to a psychology today blog until he became a head coach he often appears on twin cities television news programs as a behavioral expert in recruiting , tauer seeks selfless players who are intrinsically motivated that can be hard to discern , but the results speak for themselves the 212 tommies , winners of 16 straight before falling to concordiamoorhead on saturday , are ranked no 3 nationally and have secured at least a tie for the minnesota intercollegiate athletic conference regularseason championship , giving them a record 10 consecutive titles st thomas is 9517 under tauer , who took over after fritz coached the tommies to the 2011 ncaa division iii title in division iii , we have a limit on how much time we can and should spend with players , so they can truly balance academics and athletics , tauer said for the sevenplus months that we 're not in season , we ca n't do anything with them if we get intrinsically motivated players , they work incredibly hard in the offseason they come back as better players if we get extrinsically motivated players , we 're probably not going to see anything near the skill development teamwork and discipline were staples of fritz s teams tauer has maintained that four tommies average at least 10 points a game , and two more are at 98 and 93 , in a princetonstyle offense that relies on spacing and precise movement st thomas went more than seven years without someone scoring 30 points in a game until the senior guard marcus alipate had 30 at bethel university on jan 19 through sunday s games , the tommies led division iii in 3point shooting at 452 percent while ranking second in assisttoturnover ratio \( 162 to 1 \) though playing almost exclusively mantoman defense , the tommies had committed the thirdfewest fouls in division iii \( 288 \) st thomas s 178 victories since 2008 are the most at that level the teamwork notion is even reflected in the team s uniforms , which spell out the school initials , ust , on the back where last names usually go this month , tauer rejected a suggestion to list individual point totals on the schoenecker arena scoreboard , saying it would send the wrong message to his players john is very , very bright , and motivation is his specialty , said fritz , the university s longtime athletic director that s part of the package when you get a guy like john one of tauer s mentors , john buri , a st thomas psychology professor who taught tauer as an undergraduate , was not sure tauer s methods would work buri himself coached high school basketball for 16 years some coaches motivate through intimidation some coaches motivate through inspiration , buri said john is not an intimidator i said to john i do n't know how you 're going to do this you do n't intimidate will the guys respond to your teaching and inspiration \? ' they 're responding and the record shows it the ncaa does not keep data on coaches serving in other capacities tauer and brendan stern , a presidential fellow in government and public affairs at gallaudet university , a division iii institution in washington , are among the small group of men s basketball coaches nationally who teach neither of the two division i men s coaches who have a phd , la salle s john giannini and lehigh s brett reed , teach at their institutions , though giannini did previously at maine and rowan in division ii , tom kropp , who is a cocoach at nebraskakearney , teaches physical education none of tauer s current players are taking his class alipate , the team s leading scorer , audited a few of tauer s class sessions but decided against signing up i would n't say it s too hard , he said i 'd get called on a little more than i wanted to in his class then he laughed playing for a trained psychologist took getting used to , tauer s players said forward conner nord said that whenever tauer spoke to him in his first two seasons , he wondered what was behind it in the beginning you were almost afraid to answer , nord said you were trying to think , what is the most neutral answer i can get \? but as you go , you just answer honestly it will help him evaluate you it will help him teach you better and help him change his teaching style to match what my learning style is , almost like he would do with a student but it s translating over to basketball basically , it s like this is his classroom alipate , the son of the former jets linebacker tuineau alipate , has his own clothing line , springing from a project in an entrepreneurship class he , too , felt selfconscious some of the questions , and even some of the methods , were a lot different than i was used to in high school , alipate said he hit different parts of your brain you could tell he knew something different than the other coaches getting us to be motivated and doing things in the way that pleases us and also pleases the team , i think he does a phenomenal job doing that for tauer , a divorced father of two boys , juggling time is a constant struggle besides coaching and teaching , he runs a summer basketball camp and is completing his first book , on youth sports , parenting and motivation tauer delegates some responsibility to his assistants , all part time , but other things he must do himself two weeks ago , tauer graded papers on the team bus heading for a road game i feel fortunate that my work epitomizes the intrinsic motivation that i study , he said i love the various jobs i have , ranging from coaching to teaching to research to running camps to raising my sons as a result , it does n't feel busy it feels like i am doing exactly what i am called to do
it was a typical week for latenight television on nbc s tonight show , the host jimmy fallon played a with the modern family star sofia vergara , and for the 1990 rock ballad more than words on abc s jimmy kimmel live , mr kimmel to see how los angeles pedestrians would react to a burrito dangled above hollywood boulevard and on cbs s late late show , to choose between the pies they had ordered and the contents of a mystery box elsewhere , on cbs s late show , david letterman a ruminative , sometimes funny , casual conversation between two men who seemed almost like peers , joking about how they might share a game of dominoes after they retire mr letterman , of course , will make that transition first he is ending his 22year run on late show \( and a 33year latenight career \) on may 20 when he walks out of the famously chilly ed sullivan theater for the last time , he will be leaving a latenight landscape that , while brimming with potential and still attracting millions of viewers , is also scrambling to redefine itself in a world where latenight tv shows are increasingly not being watched at night , not for more than a few minutes and not on a tv if mr letterman represented an era when a latenight show was a comprehensive endofday viewing experience , meant to be watched in a posttwilight setting for an hour \( or until you fell asleep \) , the coming age is fragmented by technology , designed for online virality , unstructured and unmoored from time slots people are just plucking your greatest hits , without having to sit through the rest of the show , mr kimmel , 47 , the abc host , said there s more focus on singles than on albums many of the classic trappings of latenight shows are still visible opening monologues , house bands and deskside celebrity chitchats what is going away is the expectation viewers will watch these programs in close to their entirety , or even sequentially and future shows will abandon the familiar , rhythmic tempo of latenight altogether next year , , the former host of the e ! series chelsea lately , plans to introduce a netflix series that can be watched at any time of day and whose contents could vary widely from episode to episode \( ms handler , like trevor noah , who will replace jon stewart on the daily show , has yet to appear on the air in a new latenight hosting role \) i do n't want it to be the same format every single night , ms handler , 40 , said it could be 35 minutes one night , or it could be 65 minutes we might do three episodes in a week in the meantime , the people creating latenight television are experiencing varying degrees of headscratching and handwringing and periods of internet sniping as they try to determine how to distinguish their programs seth meyers , who hosts nbc s late night , observed that nearly every comedy component that was once unique to the field has been coopted elsewhere , but each performer can still find a signature element to stand out in the crowd asked if topical competitors like the daily show had taken away some of his openingmonologue turf , mr meyers , 41 , replied , certainly he added someone has the market cornered on everything , but no one has a monopoly on everything i 'd like to have a show that is good at a lot of different things , as opposed to just one thing in a positive development for these shows , the internet has allowed them to reach larger audiences while their broadcast ratings remain healthy mr fallon , 40 , the 11 35 pm champion , has nearly four million nightly viewers , while mr kimmel and mr letterman get about 27 million each \( these numbers are down over all from earlier , less fragmented eras jay leno s tonight show drew about six million viewers and mr letterman s late show about four million when they went headtohead in the 2000s \) a successful online video from one of those shows , however , can be even more powerful a reunion of the saved by the bell cast or a woman appearing to set herself aflame while attempting to twerk can receive tens of millions of views mr fallon s recurring celebrity lipsync competitions are popular enough to have spawned a hit spinoff series , lip sync battle , on the spike cable channel still , there is concern that pursuing online virality for its own sake will backfire you cannot be chasing that , because it s futile , said mr corden , 36 , the british actor who took over late late show in march if you just want to have a great viral clip , he added , i 'll strip naked and run down sunset boulevard that will get loads of views others have criticized the use of these offbeat segments for creating an overly clubby sensibility in for an overreliance on gimmickry that he called prom king comedy no celebrities , no parodies , no pranks , no mashups or hashtag wars , mr du bouchet wrote in a series of twitter posts that were later deleted you 've let the popular kids appropriate the very art form that helped you deal , he wrote none of the funniest stuff ever involved celebrity cameos mr du bouchet , who appeared to be attacking rival hosts like mr fallon , was reprimanded by his own boss conan o'brien , the former late night and tonight show host , that one of his writers should focus on making my show funnier instead of tweeting stupid things about the state of latenight comedy through their press representatives , mr fallon , mr o'brien and their staffs declined to comment for this article mr kimmel , without naming names , said this debate reflected a stupid way of looking at things should we force guests to sit in their chairs and only talk \? he said people are not allowed to get up and perform \? these are variety shows , and there s more variety than there ever was before that evolution is as much a result of shifts in the talents of the people leading these programs as in technology where mr letterman broke in as a standup comic and mr o'brien as a tv comedy writer , hosts like mr fallon and mr corden are more seasoned and dynamic performers , 50 , who played an acerbic political commentator on the colbert report on comedy central , will set aside this character when he takes over at late show in september prospective writers for his late show have been told the host still enjoys active and silly comedy , according to a set of submission guidelines these writers were provided , and have been asked to pitch jokes based on news stories as well as comedy bits mr colbert can perform with guests mr letterman , whose late night program on nbc provided a cuttingedge companion to johnny carson s tonight show in the 1980s , was welcoming of this latest wave of change going back to the creation of the tonight show in 1954 , mr letterman said , if you take a look at early steve allen shows , i 'll bet you could find versions of what is now being done maybe not as slick , certainly not in color mr letterman said the seeds of change were sown decades ago , and good for these guys that they found something else to do merrill markoe , mr letterman s original head writer at late night , said that many of its comic creations   were a response at the time to the perceived rigidity of mr carson s

in , set by balanchine to bach s d minor concerto for two violins , the steps are sometimes on the beat and sometimes not the dancers are sometimes lifted through the air as the musical line soars , and sometimes as it does n't what seems a duet in the score can become , fascinatingly , a trio or a quartet onstage it is possible , in other words , when visualizing the abstraction that is bach s music , to respond to , to amplify and to challenge it the artist did none of those in bach six solos , a numbing combination of his extremeslowmotion films and s live performance of bach s complete works for solo violin , on sunday evening at zankel hall taking as his starting point basic themes of birth , death and rebirth , as he writes in a program note , mr michalek has created short pieces to accompany each of the movements of bach s three violin sonatas and three partitas the performance \( which , with two intermissions , stretches to three hours \) starts sentimentally , with a closeup of a baby , the camera slowly panning up to a smiling mother and sibling other sections bring a still life of a vase of flowers a woman kissing an old man in a hospital bed an actress \( lili taylor \) soberly mulling a note she holds in her hand this is the tepid stuff of advertisements for blood pressure medication , not a worthy partner for bach mr shaham deserved better he built in intensity through the long performance , his tempos brisk but never rushed as he also at carnegie hall with the philadelphia orchestra and bartok s violin concerto no 2 , he is a genial and virtuosic if sometimes slightly overmild guide through musical gnarls , playing with thoughtful moderation he delivered the seething , sprawling chaconne from the d minor partita with evocative changeability but mr michalek chose to complement the piece with footage of the japanese dancer sachiyo ito , wearing a kimono and bearing fans a wan gesture toward crosscultural connection that , rather than feeling broadminded , rendered ms ito s exquisite art merely decorative dancers absorbed mr michalek most in this project , including a few prominent ones like bill t jones , herman cornejo and janie taylor and some children mr michalek slowed their movements to an adoring , pristine sheen wholly , and uninterestingly , at odds with bach s endlessly shifting , searching music the one moment the film element intrigued was when it seemed to malfunction , with the arms of the dancer accompanying a movement of the b minor partita blurring and pixelating , on the verge of dissolution here , at least , was a vision of a body more complex than mr michalek s usual generic admiration and glacial swoops of gowns
washington as the senate moves closer to a sunday night showdown over whether it will let surveillance powers expire on monday , supporters and critics of how the government has used those authorities have been using increasingly alarming language but there is little evidence in the history of the expiring laws including the one that the government uses to justify the oncesecret program that vacuums up americans' phone records in bulk to support the arguments that either side is making republican senators who want to keep the program are warning that any lapse in this critical tool would lead to attacks on the united states , as senator tom cotton , republican of arkansas , recently yet throughout the program s existence , it has never thwarted a terrorist attack , studies and testimony show at the same time , proponents of ending the program say it poses risks to americans' private lives , by permitting the government to know who has been calling psychiatrists or political groups , for example but despite the discovery of of the rules several years ago , no evidence has emerged that the program has been misused for political or personal gain as a result , the privacyminded critics have had to couch their warnings in hypothetical terms even if we stipulate for purposes of this discussion that no one within the nsa is currently abusing this program for nefarious political purposes , senator rand paul , who is running for the republican presidential nomination , said in a last week , can we say we are certain that will always be the case \? who is to say what might happen one year from now , two years from now , five years , 10 years or 15 years from now \? three counterterrorism laws are set to expire on monday , and the senate fell three votes short of moving forward with the replacement legislation before the memorial day break of the three laws , the one that has attracted the greatest attention is section 215 of the , which permits the fbi to get court orders to collect business records that are relevant to a national security investigation it has had both an ordinary use allowing agents to get specific records , like internet activity logs of a suspect , which they used about 160 times last year and an extraordinary one , the bulk phone records program the house has already passed a bill called the usa freedom act it would extend the three expiring laws but end the bulk phone records program , replacing it with one in which the government could still analyze links between callers to hunt for terrorists but would keep the bulk records in the hands of phone companies opponents of ending the current program , led by senator mitch mcconnell of kentucky , the majority leader , have made some arguments that are supported by evidence they complain , accurately , that the current program keeps the records for five years , while under the envisioned replacement , the phone companies might delete them after 18 months but they have also portrayed the importance of the program which began in october 2001 and was brought under section 215 of the patriot act in 2006 in terms that appear overstated in light of its historic performance for example , the , an independent agency created by congress , studied classified reports about how the program had been used and what the government considered to be its greatest success stories the board found no instances in which it had been abused , but also none in which it stopped a terrorist attack we found on a number of metrics , including thwarting plots and identifying terrorist activity , the program had not proven to be successful , david medine , the board chairman , said thursday it has some minor benefits that could have been accomplished through other legal means its most concrete accomplishment , according to the , was leading the fbi to scrutinize a san diego man who turned out to have donated several thousand dollars to the shabab , the islamist group in somalia there was no accusation that he was planning to commit any terrorist attack still , government officials say the program has helped them in less tangible ways , including by providing peace of mind when investigators uncover a new terrorismlinked phone number and see that it has not been in direct or indirect contact with anyone in the united states the program was also studied by a review group appointed by president obama to study surveillance policies , which included geoffrey stone , a university of chicago law professor the review group concluded that the program had not done much but said that its capabilities were worth preserving if the risks to privacy could be reduced the thing about this program is that it is perfectly logical , mr stone said thursday it may be that it will , in fact , enable the government to prevent a terrorist attack the fact that it has n't in the past six years does n't mean it wo n't in the next six years that kind of calibrated assessment , however , is increasingly absent from the political debate over the expiring laws the obama administration has also begun heating up its own language in support of the usa freedom act focusing on the prospect that the three laws may lapse , even for ordinary uses , if the senate opponents to the bill do not give in , a white house spokesman last week grossly irresponsible for risking critically important tools on wednesday , an administration official reporters that if lawmakers allowed the laws to expire they would be playing national security russian roulette but one of the three expiring laws , which permits national security wiretaps of lone wolf terrorists who are not affiliated with a group , has apparently never been used another , which permits wiretaps that follow a suspect as he changes phones , is used only rarely the third section 215 is a useful tool but has not provided any crucial breakthroughs , according to a recently released justice department inspector general report the agents we interviewed did not identify any major case developments that resulted from the records obtained in response to section 215 orders , but told us the authority is valuable when it is the only means to obtain certain information , the
winter may always be approaching in game of thrones , but as season 5 of this begins on sunday night , it feels like springtime in the known world despite one of the larger production budgets in television , the look of the series can get a little monochromatic with so much time spent among the rocky landscapes and gloomy castles where a good chunk of the action takes place , with occasional side trips to the forbidding deserts where daenerys targaryen tends to her dragons so it s a nice change that season 5 quickly adds a couple of picturesque new locations to the mix braavos , temporary home of the fugitive princess arya stark , is a quaint , sunny seaport , filmed on the croatian coast near split \( which is a few hours up from dubrovnik , where the king s landing scenes have long been filmed \) dorne , home of the illfated oberyn martell from season 4 , is a moorish fantasy of castles and gardens filmed in southern spain , partly at the alc zar of seville there s an overall feeling of recharging and regeneration about the generally grim show \( through four episodes , anyway \) , after a couple of years marked by slaughter and the grisly murders last season of various members of the lannister clan deaths are at a minimum several central characters are on the run , but none appears likely to have his or her head imminently removed on the other hand , there is a proposed marriage that seems even worse than death being on the move is a constant motif in game of thrones , and the new season does n't shirk jaime lannister \( nikolaj costerwaldau \) is on the road to dorne to retrieve his brienne of tarth \( gwendoline christie \) and podrick payne \( daniel portman \) , currently the show s most interesting pair , are chasing sansa stark \( sophie turner \) , who s still in flight under the somewhat dodgy protection of petyr baelish \( aidan gillen \) and between seasons , two of the show s fleeing heroes , arya and tyrion lannister \( the wonderful peter dinklage \) , have actually hopped continents , crossing the narrow sea to essos this promises finally to put an end to television s longestrunning buildup , in which a major character , daenerys \( emilia clarke \) , has spent 40 episodes and counting completely cut off from the rest of the main cast , dawdling toward a confrontation that s been talked about since episode 1 of course the job of david benioff and d b weiss , who wrote the first three episodes of the new season and are the series show runners , is made more difficult by the fact that george r r martin has n't gotten to that confrontation yet in his song of ice and fire books , on which game of thrones is based and you can see what may be other effects of continually negotiating between the thousands of pages of the novels and the much more limited world of the tv series the cersei lannister \( lena headey \) of season 5 is suddenly a more sympathetic or at least more relatable character in a way that feels abrupt and a little implausible on screen and arya , newly arrived in braavos , takes a course of action that makes sense by the dictates of the plot but is hard to reconcile with the headstrong , singleminded character we 've seen before quibbles aside , game of thrones is still remarkable for both the scrupulousness and the lavishness of its production , beautiful to look at and mostly engaging to follow , though there is something of the accountant s method in mr martin s fantasy progress through constant addition that transfers into the television show the beginning of season 5 is a building period , putting stones into place , without the big jolts that came early in season 4 , when the story was in a more frenzied mode but we can trust that the blood will flow more copiously before long
six years ago , the city of san francisco decided to upgrade its streetlights this is its story ok , stop this is a parody , right \? government procurement is surely too nerdy even for fixes procurement is a clerical task that cities do on autopilot decide what you need write a mindnumbing couple of dozen pages of specifications collect a few bids from the usual suspects yep , that s procurement but it doesn t have to be instead of a rote purchasing exercise , what if procurement could be a way for cities to find new approaches to their problems \? san francisco first tried for streetlights with procurementasusual in 26 leaden pages , it issued a request for proposals , or rfp , to sell the city dimmable led streetlights with wireless monitoring and controls we wrote very restrictive , tight specifications , said mary tienken , the project manager six businesses , most of them local electrical distributors , submitted proposals but none had the wireless capability san francisco needed a second round in 2011 brought the same results in the meantime , what san francisco was looking for was becoming more complex other city agencies were asking to add their own antennas atop the streetlights to monitor traffic or parking spaces , locate gunshots , read electric and water meters now the city was looking for streetlight boxes that could wirelessly manage various city services and had the capacity to add more later to find them , san francisco turned to a brandnew idea called problembased procurement instead of saying to the marketplace here s the solution we want , we said here s the challenge , here s the problem we re having , said barbara hale , assistant general manager of the city s public utilities commission that opened us up to what other people thought the solution to the problem was , rather than us in our own little world deciding we knew the answer the city got 59 different ideas from businesses in numerous countries a swiss company called paradox won an agreement to do a 12streetlight pilot test so a happy ending for the scrappy and innovative paradox \? no paradox s system worked , but the city could not award a contract for 18 , 500 streetlights that way it held another competition for just the control systems , and tried out three of them last year the city issued a traditional rfp , using what it learned from the pilots the contract has not yet been awarded dozens of cities around the world are using problembased procurement barcelona has posed six challenges that it will spend a million euros on , and moscow announced last year that five percent of city spending would be set aside for innovative procurement but in the vast majority of cities , as in san francisco , problembased procurement is still just for small pilot projects a novelty it will grow , however this is largely because of the efforts of citymart , a company based in new york and barcelona that has almost singlehandedly taken the concept from a neat idea to something cities all over want to figure out how to do the concept is new enough that there s not yet a lot of evidence about its effects there s plenty of proof , however , of the deficiencies of businessasusual with the typical rfp , a city uses a consultant , working with local officials , to design what to ask for then city engineers and lawyers write the specifications , and the rfp goes out for bids if it s a road safety issue it s likely it will be the traffic engineers who will be asked to tell you what you can do , what you should invest in , said sascha haselmayer , citymart s chief executive they tend to come up with things like traffic lights they do not know there s a world of entrepreneurs who work on educating drivers better , or that have a different design approach to public space things that may not fit into the professional profile of the consultant such a process is guaranteed to be innovationfree innovation is far more likely when expertise from one discipline is applied to another if you want the most creative solution to a traffic problem , ask people who aren t traffic engineers the rfp process itself was designed to give anyone a shot at a contract , but in reality , the winners almost always come from a small group of businesses with the required financial stability , legal knowhow to negotiate the bureaucracy , and connections put those together , and cities get to consider only a tiny spectrum of the possible solutions to their problems problembased procurement can provide them with a whole rainbow but to do that , the process needs clearinghouses ebays or craigslists for urban ideas citymart began in 2009 by asking eight cities to provide a challenge each city made a commitment to taking the idea it liked best out for a spin \( the businesses agreed to fund the pilot , because they desperately needed to demonstrate their ideas \) that exercise became a yearly event in last year s challenge , for example , london called for ways to decrease residential electricity use at peak hours , moscow sought ways to quiet traffic noise , sant cugat , spain , wanted ideas for getting otherwisewasted food to hungry people and lagos asked for ways to provide residents with power offgrid nearly all the ideas the cities received were new to them copenhagen , for example , is a global leader in urban biking yet when copenhagen asked for ideas to better integrate bikes into the city s transit system , city officials had not previously heard of 33 of the 37 solutions proposed , including the winner a navigation system named billy bike from copenhagen s near neighbor , stockholm the probability that you know the best solution for the problem is quite low , said julia haselmayer , sascha s wife , who runs citymart s american programs citymart also holds an annual summit , which drew 30 cities last year , to help cities find out about what others are doing instead of starting from scratch with each new project if new york wants to develop a parking system , you can buy one off the shelf from another city for about 60 , 000 , said sascha it might cost about 30 times as much to reinvent a solution than to find something that works that s out there problembased procurement is part of a very welcome development governments are starting to realize they don t know everything there has been a very significant shift in the last five or 10 years , said james anderson , who heads the public sector innovation program at bloomberg philanthropies it s from top down to bottom up , from government goes it alone to government as a platform for lots of people to contribute and solve problems , he said one example is the trend of payforperformance governments set a goal and pay service providers for achieving it how they do it is completely up to them another example is the increasing popularity of prizes this is actually a throwback prize challenges have a long history a clock that worked at sea and so enabled navigation was the famous winner of britain s longitude prize in 1714 \( here is a list of thousands of prizes \) prizes went out of fashion , but now they are back , even among governments the obama administration s challengegov website lists 445 challenges open this week while san francisco put out a very detailed problem to solve , philadelphia s challenge in 2013 was brief and broad do something to make the city safer philadelphia s approach combines problembased procurement with a business accelerator the city won a grant from bloomberg philanthropies mayor s challenge to start the program , which is called fastfwd , and provide money for pilot projects ten finalists began a twiceaweek boot camp in february , 2014 there they learned how to tailor their products to the city s needs , and how to work with the city they could also display their solutions in showcase events attended by city officials this was helpful in cracking the insiders network , said brian hill , the chief executive of edovo , one of the winners \( edovo , which at the time was called jail education solutions , provides prison and jail inmates with digital tablets preloaded with lessons but , for security , without internet connectivity \) khalil morrison is a case manager with the philadelphia mayor s office that helps people coming out of prison he gets exoffenders into literacy , highschool equivalency diploma and vocational classes , fatherhood programs , and job readiness training he reminds them to register to vote he tells them about jobs the city of philadelphia is safer when morrison succeeds to help his clients , morrison first has to find them he used to do this by sending out letters but a percentage of our population is transient , he said sometimes the addresses they provided a month ago have changed or he would make a lot of phone calls , leaving voice mail messages that rarely got returned now morrison uses textizen , a program from another of the winning businesses , to communicate with his clients almost all of them he has about 90 at a time have phones they can text with , and when they don t , a friend or relative does i use it to have daily contact with my clients , he said if they re working , i don t want to interrupt them at work by calling but i text every day how s it going \? any issues \? need help with kids \? mental health issues \? people respond to a text much quicker than to a voice message he uses group texts to send clients reminders about programs and classes attendance has improved exponentially , he said clients now take photos of their pay stubs and text them in , rather than having to come by the office using texts for routine matters and contact with lowrisk clients frees him up to spend facetoface or onthephone time with highrisk clients this has revolutionized case management , said morrison despite the appeal of the idea , it will take time for problembased procurement to become a significant force this will require more institutional change than individual pilot projects on their own , said story bellows , who runs fastfwd from the mayor s office in philadelphia one of the lessons fastfwd learned from its first challenge was that other city agencies had to get more involved and perceive the benefits it can t be the civic innovation office is working on this , bellows said in the next competition , each entrepreneur will be paired with a city employee who will guide the business and help design its project citymart , too , has changed its approach , abandoning annual challenges in favor of more intensive work designed to speed organizational change in a smaller number of cities among them new york , which is starting a twoyear partnership with citymart lots of governments are using the challenges , said sascha haselmayer but that s only just scratching the surface join and follow updates on to receive email alerts for fixes columns , sign up tina

eliot spitzer , the former governor of new york whose plan for driver s licenses for undocumented immigrants was the source of a stumble in a debate for hillary rodham clinton in 2007 , is aggressively criticizing her for that moment , calling it a metaphor for her soft support on the issue of immigration mr spitzer , who was the governor when mrs clinton last ran for president eight years ago , swung hard at mrs clinton in an interview this week with david axelrod , the democratic strategist and former adviser to president obama , who hosts a podcast for the university of chicago s institute of politics the former governor , who resigned in 2009 after it was revealed he was a client in a prostitution ring , recalled sitting in his living room watching the democratic debate in october 2007 , when mrs clinton and senator barack obama were asked about mr spitzer s proposal to let undocumented immigrants get driver s licenses mr spitzer recalled that mr obama , who was advised by mr axelrod at the time , was asked about it and gave a oneword answer yes when it came time for senator clinton s answer , she literally gave three different answers in 30 seconds to which chris dodd then responded , wait a minute , senator clinton , you just said three different things , what do you think \? and she waffled and waffled and waffled the moment , from a debate in philadelphia , was widely seen within mrs clinton s campaign at the time as the beginning of the end for her , a stumble for an otherwise agile debater at a moment when voters were just starting to tune into the race mrs clinton has , in her presidential bid for 2016 , positioned herself to the left of even mr obama on using executive actions to halt some deportations of illegal immigrants , as hispanic voters have become a major component of the democratic coalition mr spitzer acknowledged that he is supporting one of mrs clinton s opponents , martin o malley , and dates the candidate s deputy campaign manager , lis smith but he insisted that the moment was revealing overall about mrs clinton it was a politically tough issue , mr spitzer said it didn t poll well , but there was no ambiguity about what was right and if you look at where we are now as a nation on this very issue it s the law of the land , i think , in california , a slew of states , and it s not controversial because people know it s right and it works but at the time it was controversial and because it was controversial she hemmed and she hawed he added this goes to the core of where are you on immigrants rights \? and the president not then the president , senator obama , now the president gave an unambiguous answer yes the clinton folks , as no doubt you remember , thought the issue was the problem i thought the issue was a metaphor for her vacillation christina reynolds , a spokeswoman for mrs clinton , did not address mr spitzer s criticisms about flipflopping but she said in an email on thursday , the immigration landscape of 2015 is far different from the immigration landscape of 2007 , so of course the policy responses are different in a response focused entirely on immigration policy , ms reynolds added in 2007 , we didn t have an executive action that would focus our resources on deporting felons , not families , allowing millions of undocumented immigrants to remain in the united states in the last eight years , states have increasingly been moving in this direction with positive results hillary supports those state efforts as she said in 2007 , she believes the longterm solution is comprehensive immigration reform , but given republican obstruction , we can no longer wait for that when mr axelrod asked if the clinton campaign had asked mr spitzer to scrap the plan , he replied , yeah , we heard from folks who said they want this issue gone mrs clinton has strengths , said mr spitzer , who conceded that she is the likely nominee but mr spitzer , who once held his own presidential aspirations and who was known to be furious with mrs clinton at the time for the damage her debate answer caused to his plan for driver s licenses , suggested that doesn t mean she would be a good president she is intensely smart clever glib a joy to be with , mr spitzer told mr axelrod none of that has to do with whether or not she s the best democratic candidate for president he suggested that mr o malley , the former maryland governor , will have an opportunity to make his case to voters mr o malley has made criticism of mrs clinton over hedging on driver s licenses in the 20078 presidential campaign a key part of his message o malley has been there on the tough issues and gotten it done and i think he ll make that case , mr spitzer said when mr axelrod raised the fact that mr spitzer dates ms smith , he replied , yes , everybody knows that yes correct i am biased and overtly so and proudly so i never thought that being biased was a negative thing as long as you had a foundation for it , if it s based on fact
over the last two decades , through bob dole and george w bush and john mccain and mitt romney , it has become an article of faith that the republican presidential nominee is a person blessed by , or acceptable to , the party s establishment , meaning the elders , the bankers , the cool heads , the deep pockets there s mess along the way brief tantrums by restive voters , fleeting triumphs by renegade candidates but order and obeisance in the end is this the election cycle when that changes \? the twilight of the republican elite \? donald trump s stamina and the ascendance of and suggest as much the three of them , who have led national polls since midseptember , are n't just political outsiders , which is the label hung on them most frequently they 're instruments of protest by republican voters unwilling to heed the prompts and protocol that they 're expected to for republicans \( and perhaps for democrats , too \) this is a season of rebellion , as the chaos in the house of representatives vividly illustrates a consequential share of the republican majority there have made it clear that they will not bow to precedent , not follow any conventional script , not have anyone foisted on them no , they 'll do the foisting themselves glenn thrush of politico captured this dynamic following the withdrawal of representative kevin mccarthy from the race to be the next speaker of the house enumerating the reasons no sane person would seek the job , thrush wrote that if you have any chance of winning , you 're automatically the establishment , ' and you 're thus anathema to a group of bomb throwers in the republican caucus who are leery of anybody who followed the preordained lines of succession those bomb throwers are mirrors of the voters who are saying no to jeb bush , no to chris christie , no to john kasich , no to anyone who was once or could soon be the darling of the northeastern acela corridor and they 're pointing the republican primary in a genuinely unpredictable direction this is n't a mere replay of four years ago , when michele bachmann , herman cain and rick santorum had their moments they were middle fingers raised one at a time , in succession \( even if santorum was really more a pinkie \) trump , carson and fiorina are parallel , simultaneous phenomena , constituting a gesture of more profound rebuke i still do n't believe that any of them will be the nominee each has too many peculiarities and too big a potential to crash and burn carson seems to be on the verge of doing that right now but then who \? if the electorate really is more defiant than ever , bush is done scott walker and rick perry are already gone voters , it appears , prefer someone brattier someone like ted cruz he s perfectly positioned himself to own that space when trump and carson disappear , said a republican operative who is among the smartest analysts i know he 'll be a force to be reckoned with i think that he has a very clear path to the nomination , as much as that horrifies me this is a strange season , in which old rules and truths seem to be going up in flames it s a bonfire of the verities remember the longtime thinking that governors made the best presidential candidates , being able to cite executive experience and run on clear records \? well , perry was and walker is a governor , and none of the former or current governors still in the hunt is meeting expectations remember how much money was supposed to matter , partly for the commercials it could buy \? well , the ads did n't have , or are n't having , the intended effect for bush , perry , kasich , bobby jindal \( another floundering governor \) and on the democratic side hillary clinton remember the shock and awe of the bush rollout , in which his speedy commandeering of wealthy donors and prominent advisers was supposed to scare off or marginalize other contenders \? he s the marginalized one , at odds with the populist zeitgeist , laboring ludicrously to present himself as the skunk at the garden party and not the one sipping a cold tom collins in the gazebo s shade party leaders have begun to wonder if he can overcome voters' resistance to him , the potency of which was suggested by a private internal poll that some of them have been buzzing about it put trump in hypothetical headtohead primary matchups against each of the five next most popular candidates , according to the real clear politics average of national polls carson , fiorina , marco rubio , bush and cruz each beat trump by at least 10 points except bush , who lost narrowly to him bush finds himself in an almost impossible bind in order to distance himself sufficiently from washington , to dispel any notion that he s not conservative enough and to make the case that he s earned rather than inherited the republican presidential nomination , he has understandably begun to emphasize the past and florida he governed that state from january 1999 through january 2007 at the expense of tomorrow and america jeb s talking about things he worked on more than a decade ago let me tell you what i did in the late 1990s , ' said the operative i mentioned before , a bush fan it s a local story , and it s backwardlooking what s more , he , kasich , christie and others are selling themselves as potentially effective leaders to a republican electorate that may be more interested in fantasists who set out on futile quests , which is the modus operandi of the troublemaking house republicans and of trump , with his grand delusions when pressed about how he s going to round up 12 million immigrants , his answer is do n't worry ! one veteran republican strategist marveled how will you get mexico to pay for the wall \? i 'll do it ! the idea that you have to compromise and eventually govern that there s a constitution and we pass laws and sign treaties and have courts that can say no is thrown out the window cruz is more like trump , outrageous and unyielding , than like the governors and in a radio interview on thursday , he predicted that he 'd inherit trump s supporters because he 'd stood up to washington and taken on leaders of his own party a day earlier in national review , eliana johnson called cruz the most undercovered serious candidate in the race and the most underestimated johnson noted that he s a good fit for voters in primaries in the south , where he s been diligently organizing and spending time in politico , the conservative soothsayer rich lowry that cruz , who is not yet halfway through his first senate term , just needs voters to become slightly , and only slightly , more desirous of political experience and he s sitting pretty , as the headline on lowry s column read ted cruz sitting pretty \? this could get even uglier than i 'd feared
march madness is huge , right \? this year , the multiweek extravaganza has had its , an exhilarated coach falling off after a victory and the presence of a nearly 116 million brackets were submitted to espncom s annual contest so what in college sports could be a bigger fan draw than the ncaa men s basketball tournament \? how about a bunch of bowl games \? yes , college football bowl games nearly all of which had no meaning other than providing athletes with a postseason experience it is an imperfect comparison a tournament with a natural direction of 68 teams reduced to a final pairing versus a bowl system that only this year introduced a fourteam playoff to decide a national champion the only instance in the history of bowl games when a winner advanced to the next level so it is worth noting that none of the 38 bowl games carried by the espn empire last season had fewer viewers than the 11 million who tuned in for the from montgomery , ala , while nine earlyround ncaa tournament matchups generated audiences below that figure texas southernarizona , a tnt telecast , was ranked last at 501 , 000 based on the available data from 40 of the 48 games played before thursday march madness laid low by the likes of the belk bowl \? this is madness , i tell you , a subversion of the notion that the men s tournament is the sine qua non of college sports or it could just be simple no matter the excitement surrounding march madness , the silly season of decemberjanuary bowls is an example of football s popularity over basketball consider this iowa played two primetime ncaa tournament games last week each averaged a little more than two million viewers but iowa s afternoon loss to tennessee in the taxslayer bowl a game with nothing at stake attracted 41 million wisconsin s two victories last week generated between 27 million and 35 million viewers , but the in the outback bowl was seen by 64 million the viewership for each of louisville s tournament games did not come close to the 64 million who watched the cardinals lose to georgia in , yes , the belk bowl  on saturday night was seen by a morethanrespectable viewership of 39 million but far more , 53 million , saw the irish beat louisiana state in the music city bowl in december some of the viewership differences between the bowls and the tournament can be attributed to scheduling , matchups and networks carrying games it s easier to find an audience in prime time than in the afternoon espn is more of a sports destination than trutv , which had some of the tournament s leastwatched games espn made it easy for some of the bowls to be seen by wide audiences including the playoff games , espn , espn2 and abc carried 38 bowls last season seven were packed into new year s eve and new year s day some universities that send teams to bowl games and the basketball tournament are historically stronger at football than basketball mississippi , which is known for its football team , drew an audience of 984 , 000 when it lost to xavier in basketball last thursday afternoon but when ole miss was trampled by texas christian in the peach bowl , five million watched on the flip side , north carolina , with its five national titles in men s basketball , had more viewers for its first two tournament games than it did when its football team lost to rutgers in the quick lane bowl oregon is an illustration of the difference in attention a great football program receives over a less renowned but pretty good basketball team the in the rose bowl was seen by a little more than 28 million viewers an audience about eight times bigger than the one that tuned in for the basketball team s loss to wisconsin in prime time on sunday after beating texas southern in front of a meager afternoon audience , arizona demonstrated that having a better opponent in a better slot on a broadcast network could lead to an audience increase arizona drew 83 million viewers for its 7358 win over ohio state , a broadcast that began late saturday afternoon on cbs that total exceeded the 74 million who watched the wildcats lose to boise state on new year s eve in the fiesta bowl and state bragging rights can turn into a television magnet for fans nationally take that tipped off around 5 pm on sunday the game attracted 99 million viewers the most for any tournament game , according to available data kansas , a state with a population of 29 million , cannot be responsible for all those viewers
daytona beach , fla las vegas bookmakers have already set the odds for the 2015 nascar sprint cup championship , and the consensus is that jimmie johnson is the driver to beat kevin harvick , last year s champion , and jeff gordon are among the other favorites , along with the 2012 winner , brad keselowski this should come as no surprise to anyone who follows nascar johnson has won six of the last nine sprint cup championships , and gordon has four titles in his career both race for hendrick motorsports harvick competes for stewarthaas racing , which uses racecars built with hendrick chassis and engines harvick s boss , tony stewart , won the cup in 2011 in the same hendrick equipment for those counting , that is eight of the last nine cup championships won in hendrick cars and engines keselowski , with team penske , is the only driver to capture the cup since 2006 who did not need hendrick motorsports to pull it off go back further , and it is 13 of 20 cups for hendrick , beginning in 1995 with the first of gordon s titles hendrick motorsports has been called the yankees of nascar but even the yankees do not win like that anymore it is a level of dominance never seen in the 66 years of nascar and after hendrick won 19 of 36 races , including 6 of 10 in the playoff and the last two by harvick to clinch the title in 2014 , there is no reason to believe the hendrick racecars will be any less formidable this season so as nascar heads into sunday s seasonopening daytona 500 with gordon on the pole , johnson beside him on the front row after they topped all other qualifiers last sunday , and hendrick s dale earnhardt jr starting third in defense of his victory here last february the question facing the sport is whether that dominance has led to a competitive imbalance and if so , what does that mean for nascar \? you always like to see the success get spread around , but it goes through cycles , robin pemberton , nascar s senior vice president for competition and racing , said last month you had manufacturers that dominated , and then you had other teams that dominated in different eras so it all runs in cycles there has often been a driver to chase richard petty won seven championships from 1964 to 1979 , and dale earnhardt followed with seven titles from 1980 to 1994 i think there s always been a competitive imbalance in the sport , said kyle petty , the broadcaster , former driver and son of richard but the dominance that hendrick has shown , honestly , for the last 20 years solidly , i do n't think any team , even including petty enterprises , has been as dominant as what they 've been all the way around some of the credit goes to johnson and his crew chief , chad knaus , who combined to win five titles in a row from 2006 to 2010 and six over all as the team owner rick hendrick said , we 've won a lot , but jimmie johnsons do n't come along chad knaus and jimmie johnson combinations that much and you 've got to kind of give those guys credit but johnson and knaus are not the only reason hendrick is a juggernaut these days hendrick will field racecars for its drivers johnson , gordon , earnhardt and kasey kahne , the maximum number of teams per owner allowed all four made the playoff last season , although they did not make the fourcar finale at homesteadmiami speedway , won by harvick hendrick also supplies equipment and technical support to stewarthaas racing s harvick , stewart , the suspended kurt busch and danica patrick hendrick has another alliance with chip ganassi racing with felix sabates , which includes the drivers jamie mcmurray and kyle larson on top of that , hendrick supplies the hscott motorsports drivers justin allgaier and michael annett that is more than a quarter of the field in a 43car race driving hendrick cars the volume of information they are able and willing to share gives them an edge over every other organization rick hendrick apologizes for none of it he points out that it was toyota that first declared that its teams would work together to win when it arrived in nascar s sprint cup eight years ago other guys have the opportunity , hendrick said if they do n't do it , it s their fault in the last year , companies like nationwide insurance and 3m ditched roush fenway racing to move to hendrick liftmaster dropped ganassi s team to switch to hendrick napa , a longtime sponsor of michael waltrip racing , left after 2013 napa is now sponsoring hendrick s chase elliott it s difficult to compete with them , said sabates , of chip ganassi we lost liftmaster that was our sponsor , and we did n't get a chance to bid again they just dumped us and went with hendrick you ca n't blame them for doing that if i was liftmaster and i had a chance to go with hendrick , i 'd go with them in racing , money buys speed the more money a team has , the more it can invest in equipment and engineers to find ways to go faster those teams run well , those teams win championships and races , so they get big sponsors , they get a lot of funding , said greg biffle , whose no 16 ford was sponsored by 3m for years before the company switched to gordon this year they 've got a lot of depth well , that makes them even stronger , right \? so the snowball starts to grow how big is the snowball \? forbes estimates hendrick motorsports is worth 350 million , with projected revenue of 180 million this year joe gibbs racing is second with a valuation of 201 million and 115 million in revenue i think that s just the normal ebb and flow of sport , and rick has been at the top , and they 've demonstrated it and they 've earned everything they 've gotten , and when you 're successful , you 're going to reap the rewards for that , said steve newmark , president of roush fenway racing the patriots and the seahawks right now , they 've performed well over the last few years , but maybe in a couple years somebody else is on top but success by new england and seattle does not mean tampa bay or san diego may go out of business the nfl and other sports leagues are set up to ensure the survival of all through franchising and revenue sharing that is not nascar , where some teams have contracted after losing sponsorship and others have gone away , with new owners coming in to replace them our model historically has always been free enterprise , said mike helton , nascar s vice chairman and that freeenterprise culture , i think , is what we see ford has responded to the challenge by building a 33 , 000squarefoot facility in concord , nc , devoted to improving the performance of its race teams with more engineers and a stateoftheart racing simulator for drivers so maybe ford s drivers , led by team penske s keselowski and joey logano , will edge hendrick this year or perhaps it will be gibbs and its collection of highprofile drivers , which includes kyle busch , denny hamlin , matt kenseth and carl edwards it is a new year with a clean slate for all every season , we 've got to go out and prove ourselves , said marshall carlson , president and chief operating officer of hendrick motorsports we could come into this season and get 10 races into it and be gasping for air maybe but if you are going to vegas , do n't bet on it
pasco , wash the rallying cry in ferguson was hands up , do n't shoot ! in new york , it was i ca n't breathe ! in pasco these days , the protest signs say things like , it was just a rock ! ! ! in a case with unmistakable echoes of ferguson , mo , and new york , demonstrators have gathered every day during the past week in front of city hall to demand answers in the deadly police shooting of antonio zambranomontes , a 35yearold mexican immigrant and former orchard worker who the authorities say was throwing rocks at officers the feb 10 killing captured on cellphone video by an onlooker was the fourth by law enforcement officers in pasco in less than a year it has prompted calls for a federal investigation and disrupted this fastgrowing agricultural center of 68 , 000 , where more than half the residents are hispanic but few are members of the police force or the power structure protesters and police officials alike say they want to avoid the violence and acrimony that happened in ferguson last year when an officer shot and killed an unarmed black 18yearold we will continue to be calm , until they give us a reason not to , said a protester , hector alamillo , 62 , of pasco we are not a ferguson we will not burn things down but mr alamillo said hispanics were very distrustful right now and were wondering why officers did not use nonlethal force to subdue mr zambranomontes in the cellphone video , mr zambranomontes is seen running across a busy street , pursued by three officers as he stops and turns around , gunshots ring out and he falls dead while the shooting is under investigation by a regional task force and being watched by the fbi the police have said that mr zambranomontes had hit two officers with rocks and had refused to put down other stones they also said that a had failed to subdue him the case has cast a spotlight on the ethnic makeup of pasco , a workingclass center of apple , grape and potato production about 220 miles from seattle that has more than doubled in size since 2000 the city is more than 55 percent hispanic many residents flocked here from mexico to work in the fields and at foodprocessing plants starting in the 1960s and '70s , many of those migrant workers settled here pasco s downtown is now lined with mexican restaurants , bakeries and clothing stores , and city business is conducted in english and spanish the police force of 71 uniformed officers has 15 hispanics , and only one person on the sevenmember city council is hispanic once a hotbed of violence related to drugs and gangs , the city has seen crime plummet in the past 20 years , in large part because the hispanic community has worked with the police to drive out criminals , said police capt ken roske but there are worries that future cooperation will be jeopardized if the investigation clears the officers we are asking for more training for our officers , said lorian reavely , 39 , of pasco , a protester who stood in front of a sign reading stop police brutality it was just a rock ! ! ! the police said the officers felt threatened by mr zambranomontes he had been arrested by the pasco police early last year for assault after throwing objects at officers and trying to grab an officer s pistol , court records show the police have said mr zambranomontes was not carrying a gun or knife whether he had a rock in his hand when he was shot is still under investigation , said sgt ken lattin , a member of the kennewick police department and a spokesman for the regional investigative unit all three officers two whites and one hispanic opened fire the number of shots has not been disclosed mr zambranomontes had recently spent time in a homeless shelter after his home burned but investigators have been unable to interview anyone who saw him in the two weeks leading up to his death , sergeant lattin said officers want to know if he had mental health problems his actions were not normal , sergeant lattin said at a news conference none of you would stand out there at 10th and lewis street and throw rocks at cars and when the police show up , throw rocks at them and then run investigators' findings will be turned over to prosecutors , who will decide whether to bring charges in a letter to attorney general eric h holder jr , felix vargas , chairman of consejo latino , a local hispanic group , said that the investigation by the regional unit would have no credibility whatsoever he noted that the unit exonerated officers in three other recent fatal shootings in pasco the eyes of the world are on pasco , mr vargas said we fully expect charges to be brought last month , a pasco officer was cleared in the fatal shooting of a suspect in a car theft who pulled a pellet gun in december , an investigation concluded that a sheriff s deputy was justified in killing an intoxicated man who fired more than 60 rounds at officers in november , a prosecutor cleared two pasco officers who shot and killed a man wielding a knife mr zambranomontes s widow and two daughters have filed a 25 million claim with the city in the first step toward a lawsuit

the crowd at saint vitus on friday night at first seemed recessive , iceweary , a little off it was n't moving normally a hardcore show deals with passivity pretty quickly volume plus speed plus aggression equals breakthrough as for this one a quadruple bill ending with the fairly new bands sick feeling , from brooklyn , and obliterations , from los angeles the breakthrough came late , if it ever came at all hardcore punk has been around long enough to have become what musicbusiness promoters and publicists call heritage music it s been codified and historicized for instance , in a great new oralhistory book by tony rettman , nyhc , about the beginnings of new york hardcore in the 1980s the book recounts stories and reprints gig fliers from events that seemed at the time to be unattended by anyone with any influence over the historical record but hardcore s heritage status also means that a new band does n't have to give it full credence as a channel of hope and protest and rebellion it can be messed with , treated like a given , made conceptual , turned upsidedown for effect some of both was happening on friday incursions into hardcore and historical reenactments of it no wonder members of the crowd thought twice before they moved sick feeling seems like two bands at once one is shouting and riffbased and straightforward one is discursive , ghostly , out to lunch it has just released its first record , suburban myth \( terrible \) when you look at some of its songs on a soundcloud page , rendered in wave forms , you see clearcuttings amid the orange forest of volume stretches of weird , hardrightturn , lowervolume activity amid the conventional hardcore in a live set , those are the parts when the drummer alan yuch suddenly leaves his cymbals alone or stops playing altogether , the guitarist don devore moves over to electronic loops and synthesizer tones , and the singer jesse millergordon starts muttering or raving , pacing and shaking , swallowing his words \( he has a good enraged yell , but his singing has little body he can seem like a placeholder for someone else \) on friday , the songs were short , and the pauses were awkward repeatedly the action surged , then dropped this is a band that uses dramatic contrast the way most hardcore bands use roars and chants this is a band that wants you to think about imminent failure obliterations make you only think about success , in terms of how powerfully they use conventions of hardcore speed \? mind ai n't right swing \? ca n't afford to die droning repetition \? shame simple , centralized minorkey riffs \? the narcissist the singer sam james velde knows what he s putting you in mind of he blows out guttural phrases and rounds his screamed vowels like a cross between black flag s third and fourth singers , dez cadena and henry rollins you can listen to obliterations' deeply satisfying new album , poison everything \( southern lord \) , and feel that these are people who were born to do this alone in truth it s a band of people who have been in other rock bands that sound like other rock bands , none of them hardcore per se black mountain , bluebird , night horse , pink mountaintops , saviours it s a skillful party of record collectors and classicists it s hardcore played by fancy at least as much as by need on friday you had to remember what you were there for the insured power , the calibrated impact at first it was a struggle the sound system was reducing that power by half mr velde s voice strained to be heard the drums sounded small , and the swing was n't quite happening it took 15 minutes before the breakthrough came , on black out my conclusion , the only solution , is to black you out ! and the audience woke up , formed a moshpit , and engaged in the historical process of charging and shoving
seattle all ballet companies become like families in their internal dynamics in my experience , however , none gather dancers and audience together with the intimacy of almost every performance has a preshow educational talk and a postshow conversation with one or more individual dancers \( most questions are from the audience \) , and each season ends with a galalike occasion honoring each departing performer i was here on sunday night to watch the farewell performance of , one of the most marvelous ballerinas of our day but that occasion proved to be about more than one dancer ms k rbes shared it with five other departing dancers , who all performed solo roles first , peter boal , the company s artistic director , described each dancer to the audience in a curtain speech his tone was always affectionate and generous , sometimes humble and sometimes teasing summing up the corps dancer , who joined the troupe in 2012 and is moving to the san francisco ballet , mr boal suggested a combination of audrey hepburn and tinker bell with dangerously long eyelashes other departees included the corps dancers \( who arrived in 2013 \) \( a seattle native , who joined in 2008 \) and \( who joined in 2011 \) and , notably , the soloist \( who joined the company in 2001 , and who is leaving the stage but remaining with the company and its school as a teacherchoreographer \) if you 'd never seen any of these dancers before , sunday evening gave you a chance to know each as an artist mr bouchard danced in william forsythe s the vertiginous thrill of exactitude \( which pacific northwest acquired this season \) , and mr gaines in nacho duato s rassemblement and a suite of excerpts from george balanchine s jewels showcased mr hipolito in the emeralds pas de trois mr mccall in the emeralds walking pas de deux ms frantziskonis in the central pas de deux of rubies and ms k rbes in the diamonds pas de deux mr boal s curtain speech reached its most memorable when he spoke of his first encounter with ms k rbes , who is brazilian then a principal dancer with new york city ballet , mr boal went to brazil to perform the title role of balanchine s apollo after a delayed flight , he went straight to rehearse the pas de deux with this teenage brazilian terpsichore so he began , as the choreography requires , by reclining on the floor and extending one arm behind him then he turned his head to look back at the young muse whose finger was touching his and i had that rare experience that i was the student , he said the exceptional level of artistry and generosity exemplified by ms k rbes was apparent even then he helped bring her to new york and the school of american ballet he helped talk her through an injury that put her future as a dancer in jeopardy and when he moved to seattle , she joined him , and the ensuing k rbes decade featured many glories pacific northwest ballet had already had esteemed ballerinas patricia barker , louise nadeau , kaori nakamura and ms k rbes became for many the finest ballerina in america anyone can see why she caused such a stir some new york dancers are more dramatic , more voluptuous , faster , but the dancing of the fairhaired ms k rbes has an unmannered purity that epitomizes ballet as an art europeans often ask if dancers from the balanchine training provided by the school of american ballet can also excel in the traditional european repertory ms k rbes , a beautiful giselle in pacific northwest s 2011 production and a noted exponent of other ballet classics , has been this century s finest answer to that question and as for balanchine , she has been a radiant interpreter of many of the most privileged roles in his repertory , dancing the leads in apollo , serenade , agon , a midsummer night s dream , emeralds , diamonds she is not retiring from dance \( she plans to appear in august at the , where she has been a recurrent visitor in past years \) but she will now be a freelancer , and her performances are likely to be infrequent ms k rbes danced three pieces on sunday in the calling , a solo by jessica lang to french medieval music , she looked like a dream vision of eva per n with a white gown trailing for yards around her , making her nearly immobile beneath the waist ms k rbes took this restriction as an opportunity her fascinating mastery of arm movement was poetry in itself the program and the pacific northwest season ended with balanchine s serenade , with ms k rbes dressed the same as 19 other women they included ms frantziskonis and , in featured roles , two other company principals , carrie imler \( in the russian dance \) and lesley rausch \( as the dark angel \) as the ballet s heroine \( also known as the waltz dancer \) , ms k rbes had a role that included love , death and transcendence , but , above all , dance dance study , dance companionship , dance continuity that k rbes purity not least those arms shone through the ballet , adding yet more layers of meaning to its many shades of emotion for many of us , though , the evening s climax was the exalted pas de deux from karel cruz was ms k rbes s partner here , as throughout her career , her dancing was selfless and refined and yet there were moments of astonishing liquidity , voluptuousness , delicacy and fullness , and her protean mystery became more evident than ever suddenly switching position in mr cruz s arms on a single beat , she both revealed herself and eluded his grasp advancing on point , with torso slowly lifting from a forward tilt to a backward arch , she was a mythical creature \( some balanchine scholars feel that the image here is of both lady and unicorn \) twice , while her partner held her , her abdomen plunged low with ravishing , enchanting freedom we often speak of stars as people we 've come to know with ballerinas , however , the opposite is often true on sunday , more than ever before , ms k rbes was the most compellingly unknowable , the most inspiringly enigmatic human in the world
my phone does n't ring much anymore it used to at all hours , but since i stopped answering , most of my friends have stopped calling mostly , i receive invitations by email , which is good , as it gives me time to compose my regrets i'm way too busy this week , how about next month \? all week i field invitations this way , worried constantly about my schedule being overwhelmed then the weekend arrives , and i find myself with nothing to do when my phone does ring , i wait until it stops then , depending on the urgency suggested in the voice mail , i 'll call back in a month or three incidentally , i have an iphone , the best callscreening technology money can buy i write down the calls i owe friends on a todo list , along with things like laundry and taxes laundry and taxes usually get crossed off first , while the ink used to write call may fades like a tattoo on an aging hipster i try to call during hours when i'm reasonably sure my friends will be unavailable , so i can leave a cheerful voice mail message saying , sorry i missed you ! hopefully , they wo n't get back to me too quickly some of them do , and this causes me a lot of pain waiting for the ringing to cease , i get out my todo list and write their names under pay con ed what i hate is when they get back to me right away i ca n't realistically pretend i'm not there when only a moment ago i was i do n't want to insult them they are my friends , after all so i pick up and , eager to get off the phone , begin making false promises to get together soon thankfully , with friendship it s the thought that counts , so once you 've declared your desire to get together , there is little need to actually do it every friendship is tied by an invisible elastic band , however you can stretch your friendship a pretty long distance , but stretch it too far , and it will snap knowing how important it is to have friends , every now and then i arrange to meet mine unfortunately , when i have n't seen friends in a while they want to catch up catching up is a lot like being audited , as it forces you to account for all the time since you last caught up over dinner , friends say things like , how are you \? the short answer is fine it s short because it ends conversation then you have to think of something else to say the long answer is miserable it s long because they 'll want to know why , and then you have to tell them the medium answer is , fine , and you \? but sometimes they say , how are you \? as if asking after the condition of your soul you can usually avoid soulful discussions by trying , as i do , to keep things light i got a new job , and for my new year s resolution i 've taken to drinking eight glasses of water a day my skin looks great , but i constantly have to pee i have time for little else which is why i have n't seen you in so long between the new job and the peeing , i'm swamped what s new with you \? the whole enterprise is exhausting and yet , one needs friends i recently lost one of my mine she called and emailed a number of times without reply before , finally , she gave up this makes me sad if only there were some way besides calling or writing or seeing her face to face to tell her that i think of her often , that , indeed , her friendship means the world to me a few years ago , when we were still friends , she got married unfortunately , i was n't able to attend the wedding because of work obligations i was unemployed at the time , but she did n't know that , and so it seemed a good enough excuse i did click onto her wedding registry , however i bought the couple two gifts wine glasses and scuba diving lessons i just punched in my credit card info , and bam , my friendship obligation was fulfilled it was such a simple exchange and i felt very good about it for a while many people really disliked the idea of online wedding registries , arguing that they made gift giving impersonal but now pretty much every couple has one if only friends had them , too a friend registry would simplify our social lives once and for all , making it easy to maintain our most cherished relationships with none of the bother of facetoface meetings would n't it be lovely if you could sign up for an automatic payment plan , stating that every year on some prescribed date , say , april 15 , a fee of some amount 20 for distant friends , 30 for close ones would be transferred from your account to your friends' \? and if they were true friends , they would not simply take the money , but would reciprocate with their own deposit , so that no money was ever lost between you a friendship is the perfection of give and take , after all , and this way we 'd be able to keep track of ours online by perusing our account balance and if that balance ever dipped too low , then we 'd know , with certainty , what it is to feel lonely
the california senate s passage of the end of life option act last week , which would allow terminally ill people to choose to end their lives , filled me with both joy and sadness the bill which needs the approval of the state assembly and gov jerry brown to become law would have made all the difference when i tried to help my friend robin kill herself five years ago we d been friends for 22 years she had pancreatic cancer , and no chance of recovery so when she could no longer tolerate music , watch television , read , eat or rise from her bed , it wasn t a complete surprise when another friend called to say that she wanted our help to end her suffering this was going to be the good death , carefully orchestrated , carried out in a circle of love i chronicled this story in my memoir i see you made an effort , except that i didn t tell the whole truth i wrote that i wasn t sure of the legality of this act but i knew we were committing a crime in the state of california it was late in the afternoon , on a saturday , when five of robin s closest friends assembled at her bedside the plan was to give her drugs that would help her fall into a deep sleep from which she would mercifully not awaken as i understood it , we were going to use a combination of her cornucopia of prescription medications her home health aide retreated to the spare bedroom and we took charge we toasted her we kissed her we told her we loved her the air was charged with adrenaline and sorrow it really felt like a celebration as we started upping her pain medication one by one we pushed the delivery button on her morphine drip we all wanted our fingerprints recorded i suggested we put her dog s paw on the pump to really confuse things it was the best party you never want to be invited to attend she had paxil , wellbutrin , ativan , morphine , oxycodone , clonazepam and haldol in her system when we puffed her pillows , smoothed her comforter and settled in for the night we thought it would go more easily if we left the room , so we turned on a baby monitor to keep tabs on her as she drifted off but after a few hours it became clear that the drugs were having the opposite effect she seemed more energetic than possible for someone who was about to die none of us were medical professionals were we causing her unintended suffering \? it was a terrible and terrifying responsibility under the guise that we d upped the medication because robin was experiencing pain , we phoned one of the hospice nurses she explained that some patients have a paradoxical reaction to benzodiazepines and advised us to increase the medications even more her family in new jersey had all but left us in charge of her care we decided to press on and up the medication we made sure she was comfortable before we hunkered down waiting for her to let go just let go it was 3 am when we heard her calling for us two of us went in i need to get up and walk i need interaction , she said as she tried to lift her skeletal frame from the bed no , robin , you can t get up , the other friend said flatly something inside me went numb i said nothing silently , robotically , i shifted her position on the bed i tucked her in tightly i turned my back to her i walked out of her bedroom and closed the door behind me that s the moment i replay in my mind , late at night , when i look down at the delicate art deco ring that she always wore and that s on my finger now how totally dependent she was on us how her bony hands had pulled at her nightshirt to cover herself when i moved her how her attempt at modesty was the last gesture i would witness from my friend robin the five of us huddled in the living room if we go back in , one friend reasoned , robin s going to keep reaching out for us and it s only going to get harder on her there had been so many goodbyes every time she d come close to dying in those last months , we d all rushed to her bedside we were wrung out , all of us , and especially robin you re losing me , she had reminded us , but i m losing all of you at once i made the appalling decision not to go back into her bedroom for another farewell one by one we departed until just one friend remained with her when she slipped into a coma , late sunday afternoon only the home health aide was at her home at the time of her death on monday morning if medical aid in dying had been legal , her doctor could have written the right prescription and allowed her to have the more graceful exit she wanted still , as imperfect as it was , we gave her a memorable sendoff at the very end , she was alone , as we are all in death , but right before that , she was in a circle of love i believe she knew that i have to is an actress and the author , most recently , of i see you made an effort
new york has seen the sensational russian ballerina in a wide range of ballets but , curiously , never in the illustrious double role of odetteodile in swan lake this now changes , but on screen , not onstage now in her second season of the royal ballet in london , she recently danced the role three times at the royal opera house , covent garden the last of these , performed on tuesday , is to be , starting tonight in east coast theaters \( west coast streamings occur later this month \) i saw the first , on feb 21 , during a trip to london ms osipova was riveting throughout her noholdsbarred way \( here , as with every role \) shows that she s still an incomplete but growing artist but her energy and concentration ensure that you ca n't take your eyes off her it s fascinating that , though she s made her name as a whizkid virtuoso , she found fewer rewards in the bravura of the antiheroine odile on this occasion whereas as odette , the swan queen , she made a powerful impression though other companies establish odette s heroic grandeur and lyrical phrasing , no troupe matches the royal s long tradition of showing odette as a creature of complex poignancy she acquires a narrative far more detailed than the one printed in the scenario it s this aspect that ms osipova , ardent but vulnerable , embraced a number of other russian ballerinas , even when appearing with the royal , have avoided mime in swan lake yet ms osipova immediately demonstrated odette s plight with sweeping and incisive mime that had all her characteristic intensity in the lakeside dances , she never let narrative or psychological tension drop each phrase revealed a different aspect of hope , doubt , tenderness , diffidence , resolution one stylistic misjudgment came in some of the arched swan positions she took with prince siegfried s support instead of the swan s heroic lines , ms osipova often employed softer arm contours that belonged to some different ballet as odile , she was both minx and tornado while she played most of the role with impressive seriousness , she showed none of this seductress s grand glamour she also employed a largely soviet version of the choreography , large , flashy , but without the small glittering steps that give it dimension the result is relentless , lacking the contrasts of scale and amplitude of line that characterize marius petipa s original choreography even so , she s a force of nature in the fouett turns , as well as in the multiple pirouettes of her solo variation , her sheer velocity , even violence , had something of the demonic her prince siegfried was , who joined the royal ballet at much the same time she did he would have brad pitt looks but for two things he has what have been called bedroom eyes \( narrow , never remotely showing their whites to the audience \) and , when demonstrating nobility , he has a nervous habit of hoisting his jaw upward \( as if to look haughty \) even so , he already has far more stage presence than in the sleeping beauty a year ago and his dancing now demonstrates real brilliance and prowess in several crucial respects , this \( though this is to be its farewell season \) is a yardstick for others , and not just in the large degree to which it is faithful to the records of the 1895 st petersburg production choreographed by petipa and lev ivanov the extent of mime in both lakeside scenes and the contributions of childswans in the first one \( at two points ringing odette s feet like supplicants \) make swan lake far more textured the world of the swanmaidens becomes a layered society of mutual supportiveness and complex responsibility more vital is the way the company makes that choreography suspenseful , musical and dramatically serious yolanda sonnabend s make what many swan lake purists , myself included , consider a mistake in placing the ballet in late19thcentury russia the mythic dimension of arthurian chivalry is lost since the staging has had remarkable longevity , they have also encouraged many people to think swan lake occurs in a relatively recent historical era a number of lesser productions have followed its lead in this respect this modernhistory version of swan lake is redeemed by the best royal ballet actors as the prince s mother gives one of the most remarkable mime performances in world ballet she s no imposing gorgon but a poised woman of exceptional dignity and subtle emotion the way she distinguishes between public and private gestures is beautiful we know when she is speaking intimately to her son , when she is addressing the court , and when she cannot help her feelings becoming evident outside her immediate circle the whole world of the ballet becomes more real when she is onstage
republicans hate activist judges those blackrobed elites who are willing to upset the lives of millions of people just to further a political cause ditto trial lawyers trolling for clients , the ambulancechasing , better call saul guys they hate them , until they need them and in the raw power play that is behind the attempt to kick millions of people off health care gained through the affordable care act , republicans are attempting one of the most brazen manipulations of the legal system in modern times to pull it off , they 're relying on a toxically politicized judiciary to make law , and to make a mockery of everything that conservative legal scholars profess to believe in less than two weeks' time , the supreme court will hear oral arguments in king v burwell the net result of a wellorchestrated , wellfinanced , fiveyear campaign to kill president obama s signature achievement by legal assassination , the plaintiffs may lack standing , and a host of business and health care professionals have said the consequences of backing the rightwing consortium behind this case could be catastrophic but none of that matters to at least four justices on the court who would rule in favor of a ham sandwich , if it meant overturning the health care law , more than eight million people in 34 states could lose their health coverage premiums for several million more would rise enough to make insurance impossible thousands of people , lacking basic care , may even die prematurely the supreme court is going to render a body blow to obamacare from which i do n't think it will ever recover , said senate majority whip john cornyn of texas last month he was licking his chops in anticipation this comes at a time when republicans have recently discovered the working poor for those holding to the last , slippery rung of middleclass dignity , nothing is harder than having no health insurance and there is no bigger knockout blow , forcing a family into bankruptcy , than a massive medical bill so , consider just who stands to lose most if the health care subsidies for people in twothirds of the states are denied as the plaintiffs are demanding of the supreme court more than 80 percent of them are lower or middleincome people , working part time or full most of them are white and majority of them are in the south so much for helping your base enrollment for private coverage under obamacare is surging this year , particularly in red states in texas alone , more than a million people have signed up all the dire predictions that enough young people would n't join the exchanges , that health care expansion would be a job killer , that premiums would soar have turned out to be bogus and so it comes down to this a legal challenge based on a technicality specifically , four words should subsidies be available only to exchanges established by the states \? or were they designed to cover the entire nation , as is obvious in the intent of the law \? the supreme court case , to be decided by june , grew out of a gathering in 2010 of farright attorneys looking for a way to destroy obamacare this bastard has to be killed as a matter of political hygiene , said michael s greve , a former chairman of the competitive enterprise institute , during a panel discussion i do n't care how this is done , whether it s dismembered , whether we drive a stake through its heart , whether we tar and feather it and drive it out of town , whether we strangle it the first attempt to strangle it failed by one vote in a 2012 supreme court ruling the next assault is this case , organized by the same competitive enterprise institute , an advocacy group with long ties to climate change denial and tobacco distortion campaigns they found four plaintiffs right out of a rush limbaugh dittoheadfest , all of whom have come under withering press scrutiny of late one is just a halfyear shy of eligibility for medicare two others are military veterans who appear to qualify for premiumfree federal care somehow , they claim to be harmed by a technicality in the health care law that allows the federal government to subsidize people who do n't get help from the states that did not set up their own markets you are asking us to kick millions of americans off health insurance just to save four people a few dollars , said judge andre m davis , in oral arguments before a federal appeals court in richmond , va that court ruled unanimously to throw out the challenge but the hyperpartisan supreme court took up the case on appeal one of many ironies here is that at least three of those plaintiffs appear to qualify for the great socialist , singlepayer system used by medicare or by veterans affairs so , they do n't really have to worry if their legal assault kills the health care of millions of people who do n't have access to the cheaper federal plans so long as judges do their dirty work , republicans do n't have a problem with politicizing the judiciary this week , in a move that dramatically changes the lives of millions of people , a texas federal judge with a history of animus toward the obama administration s immigration policy brought a halt to plans to bring people out of the shadows before ruling against the president s decision to defer deportation of certain immigrants , judge andrew hanen , an appointee of george w bush , had left a trail of comments that could have come out of the mouth of any gardenvariety republican with a swift blow this week , he did exactly what republicans in congress have been trying , but so far failed , to do chief justice john g roberts jr once used a memorable phrase to describe this kind of activism my job is to call balls and strikes , and not to pitch or bat , he said during his confirmation hearings by june of this year , we 'll see which side of the plate he s on
boston hilary knight pulled her car into a grocery store parking lot in 2012 , called home and began crying after leading wisconsin to two national titles in women s hockey , she had packed her belongings and driven to boston to train full time with the united states national team but after watching a young employee collecting shopping carts , she felt almost envious and lost playing for the national team had been knight s childhood dream but women looking to continue their hockey careers faced huge obstacles , expected to scrape by on stipends and whatever outside work they could fit around their training schedules knight resented the fact that the landscape for women had not changed since 1998 , the year women s hockey became an olympic event and the united states won the gold medal i said , here i am , a college graduate , elitelevel athlete , and i ca n't make ends meet , knight said i ca n't get compensated for what i'm worth , essentially , so how are we going to change that \? three years later , knight , 26 , one of the world s best players , is leading the charge toward mainstream visibility it is a ton of pressure she is the face of women s hockey , said digit murphy , who coached knight in the canadian women s hockey league , the only women s professional league in north america before the national women s hockey league at 5 feet 11 inches and 172 pounds , knight has a combination of size , strength , athleticism and skill that is unmatched , the equivalent of a female lebron james on skates but off the ice , the creation of the nwhl has put knight in an unfamiliar and uncomfortable position through texts , phone calls , airport conversations and bus rides , players have bombarded her for career advice i was like , why are you asking me \? knight said but i also saw that if we did n't talk about it , if i did n't offer advice or my insight on it , people were scared for me , it was also a growth process , to be able to stand up and say this is what i'm doing i think it s right for our sport i think it s right for future generations knight will play for the boston pride of the nwhl , the first major professional women s hockey league to offer salaries one of the players she advised was zoe hickel , a recent graduate of minnesotaduluth , who has also moved to boston with the season opening oct 11 , knight still worries about her choice what if we fall on our faces and i 've convinced everyone to join a new league \? knight said this is on me , and i would feel awful if that happened if it fails , it fails but at least we tried something different as the most marketable player in women s hockey , with sponsorships and partnerships with nike , chobani , red bull , gopro , casio and the hockey equipment manufacturer stx , knight is in a stronger financial position than many of her colleagues but as with any new venture , there are unknowns that even she must grapple with one of them is what to charge for speaking engagements , a question she often hears from teammates we kind of have to establish a price integrity for ourselves , and figuring out how much you 're worth in a market that does n't even exist is very difficult , knight said the key to growth for women s hockey is television exposure the 2014 gold medal game between the united states and canada drew 49 million viewers and doubled the 2010 ratings , according to nbc usa hockey reports that registration for its programs for women and girls rose 374 percent from 201314 to 201415 in the nwhl , knight s name will be one of the first used to sell the league to networks she s maybe the biggest women s hockey player namewise in the world , nwhl commissioner dani rylan said it s definitely easy to throw that out there and have someone resonate with that on a recent thursday , knight awoke at 6 am for a workout with the national team in woburn , mass , then had physical therapy and acupuncture and did individual skating once the season begins , she estimates , all but 60 to 90 minutes of her day will be consumed by hockey hockey , in fact , is so ingrained in knight that she coats the wooden floors of her apartment with pledge so that when she takes her shoes off , she can glide across them , simulating the feeling of letting her blades carry her on the ice she has lived there for a year , but the interior is mostly bare , though there are notes conspicuously scattered about reminding her to buy groceries , reply to fan mail or send clothes to her mother knight , who last year practiced with the anaheim ducks and hopes to one day play in an nhl game , understands that she is fortunate not to have to work in addition to training she has been criticized at times for being the only player in the limelight when there are comparably skilled teammates and yet even knight has to face constant reminders of women s hockey s place in american sports before her afternoon skate , knight stopped at pure hockey , an equipment shop in medford , mass , to get her skates sharpened unlike an nhl facility , the local rink has no sharpening equipment , just two workers drinking sodas in an otherwise empty building prominently displayed behind the register were boston bruins player shirts the walls were covered with images of famous hockey moments , none featuring women remembering that she also needed tape for her sticks , knight reached into her wallet and paid 1166 occasionally , she feels burned out , but she is unshaken in her commitment to building the game , grateful for the opportunities to travel the world and yet for all that hockey has given knight , it has also taken away she intentionally avoids reading facebook updates from her closest friends it almost feels like i'm stuck in time in some way when everyone else is continuing on with their life , knight said it s not a bad thing it s just when you sit there and think about that , you 're like , oh my gosh , maybe i should start a

philadelphia as officials on sunday prepared to restore train service in the northeast corridor , officials representing law enforcement , emergency medical workers and the government held an emotional memorial service near the site of tuesday s deadly train derailment at the service , mayor michael nutter of philadelphia promised that the eight people who were killed in the accident will not have died in vain the memorial took place near a curve in the tracks where a new yorkbound passenger train derailed , killing eight and injuring over 200 as the mayor read out the names of the dead , each time a bell was rung and a dove released the living and the dead have consecrated this ground , mr nutter said we will never forget what happened here the railroad announced sunday that trains on its acela express and northeast regional routes would be back in service on monday morning , with the first trains leaving philadelphia at 5 53 am and new york at 5 30 am service between the cities had been suspended since the accident we could not have a restoration of service without a service to recognize and respect what happened at this place , mr nutter said at the ceremony , which about 100 people attended gov tom wolf of pennsylvania said he experienced great sorrow , but took comfort from the selfless efforts of local people who helped victims , and train riders who went to the aid of fellow passengers human beings have a lot of inherent goodness , he said mr wolf said the derailment also had drawn attention to what he called the contingency of life , noting that none of the victims had boarded the train with any thought that their lives would end that night the ceremony began and ended with addresses by rabbi eli friedman and the rev thomas higgins , and included a performance of amazing grace by the philadelphia heritage chorale , whose 13 members were dressed in black anthony foxx , the united states transportation secretary , pledged that there would be no similar accidents in the future we will honor them by making sure this never happens again , he said investigators have not yet determined why northeast regional train 188 derailed brandon bostian , the train s engineer , has said he does not recall the moments before the accident investigators have determined that the train accelerated from 70 to 100 miles per hour less than a minute before it left the rails the speed limit on the curve where the accident occurred is 50 miles per hour an assistant conductor on board told investigators that the train may have been struck by an object before it tumbled off the tracks robert l sumwalt , a transportation safety board official who is leading the investigation in to the crash , appeared on several talk shows on sunday and said that the engineer reported nothing to dispatchers about anything hitting the train we heard no communications at all from the amtrak engineer to the dispatch center to say that something had struck his train , mr sumwalt said on a sunday amtrak s president , joseph h boardman , who attended the service , said in a statement that the safety of passengers and crew members remains our no 1 priority our infrastructure repairs have been made with the utmost care and emphasis on infrastructure integrity including complete compliance with federal railroad administration directives , mr boardman said amtrak staff and crew have been working around the clock to repair the infrastructure necessary to restore service for all the passengers who travel along the northeast corridor at the memorial , he said , we 'll open with service tomorrow morning , a safer service on saturday , the federal railroad administration instructed amtrak to take several steps to increase safety on the northeast corridor amtrak was ordered to use a technology to control the speed of trains , known as automatic train control , for all northbound trains at the derailment site the technology had been in use for southbound trains , but not for northbound trains like the one that derailed
at his home in maryland , adrian dantley was a proud alumnus as he watched the men s basketball team overcome a 10point secondhalf deficit to defeat duke last week the victory continued the fighting irish s improbable success this season , made the senior guard jerian grant a national player of the year candidate and brought back memories of when dantley starred for notre dame four decades ago dantley has never met grant or spoken to him , but he knows the two have similar backgrounds grant is the first player from dematha catholic high school , a basketball powerhouse in hyattsville , md , to play for notre dame since dantley left the university in 1976 entering saturday s rematch at no 4 duke \( 193 , 63 atlantic coast conference \) , grant is averaging 173 points and 64 assists per game and is on track to become the second fighting irish player since dantley to be named a firstteam allamerican and the no 10 fighting irish \( 213 , 92 \) are off to their best start in 36 years dantley is impressed by grant , who was suspended for the second semester last season for what notre dame called an academic matter university officials have declined to discuss details of the punishment , but grant , who briefly contemplated turning professional , was allowed to return last summer and vowed to make up for his mistake he could 've easily bailed out , said dantley , who averaged 243 points per game in 15 nba seasons and was inducted into the basketball hall of fame in 2008 you 've got to admit he s got some perseverance and sticktoitiveness to come back and have a good year you 've got to give him credit for that grant is the latest member of his family to excel on the court his father , harvey , and uncle , horace , were firstround picks , and each played more than a decade in the league when grant was not watching games growing up , he participated in physical matchups against his brothers , jerai , a former forward at clemson who plays professionally in latvia jerami , a rookie with the philadelphia 76ers and jaelin , a senior at dematha at 6 feet 5 inches , grant is taller than most guards he faces , but he is smaller than his father , uncle and brothers i 'll tell you what he does not like people to say , yo , you 're the shortest one , ' harvey grant said , laughing oh , that gets under his skin jerian grant said none of them can beat me just because they 're taller they still ca n't i'm a better player grant learned his competitive spirit from his high school teammates as well at dematha , he started alongside duke guard quinn cook , pittsburgh guard james robinson , georgetown forward mikael hopkins and orlando magic guard victor oladipo grant s mother , beverly , referred to oladipo as her fifth son because he was around her house so often still , notre dame coach mike brey chose to redshirt grant as a freshman brey , who also attended dematha and in the 1980s was an assistant coach there , thought an extra year of development would help grant , who would not have played much behind the senior point guard ben hansbrough , the 2011 big east player of the year a disappointed grant told brey he was not sure if he would stick around he was definitely adamant about me staying , grant said i definitely talked to him a lot about how he was going to take care of me , that this is the best decision grant started as a sophomore and a junior and entered last season as a preseason firstteam allacc selection he averaged 19 points and 6 assists in notre dame s first 12 games before his academicrelated suspension with grant out , notre dame lost 13 of its final 20 games and finished with its worst record , 1517 , since brey arrived in 2000 although he was far from campus , grant remained part of the team s group text messages and sent emails to brey after each game with feedback and suggestions he spent a few weeks in california working out with his uncle , horace , and he traveled to visit his godparents , grandparents and friends when he was home , he lifted weights , played pickup games and trained under the guidance of dematha coach mike jones and keith stevens , grant s former club coach grant briefly considered declaring for the nba draft before realizing he had unfinished business at notre dame soon after grant returned in midjune , brey noticed a more fit , determined , consistent and vocal player joe carr , a sports psychologist , worked with the fighting irish players during the summer and encouraged them to share their feelings brey said some of grant s teammates told him that he had let them down the previous season but that they forgave him brey said grant understood he had to prove himself he was never a guy that had great eating habits , brey said he was never a guy maybe that had great practice habits he was not a guy that would be engaged defensively consistently all that has changed , and he s handled himself like a man grant is scheduled to graduate with a sociology degree in may , and he will probably become the first notre dame player since ryan humphrey in 2002 to be a firstround pick in the nba draft his assisttoturnover ratio is better than three to one , and his ability to make smart decisions when running the pickandroll is an important skill in the nba he is also reliable late in games in the final 71 seconds against duke last week , grant scored as the shot clock expired , found a teammate for an open 3pointer and blocked a shot to help clinch the victory three days later , he had 9 points in the final three minutes , but notre dame lost to pittsburgh by 4 since 2007 , the fighting irish have missed the ncaa tournament only twice , but they have lost in the first round four times and never advanced past the second round grant is eager to change their recent history , which does not surprise oladipo , one of his best friends and training partners this past summer , i saw how locked in he was and ready to play , oladipo said he had a minor setback , but it was just a setup for an even bigger comeback he s ready , man he s ready to lead them and help them win
washington the on monday heard arguments in a death penalty case and issued decisions on the monitoring of sex offenders and on the significance of a lawyer s brief absence from a criminal trial monday s arguments , in brumfield v cain , no 131433 , concerned kevan brumfield , a louisiana man who was sentenced to death in 1995 for killing a baton rouge police officer seven years later , in , the barred the execution of the intellectually disabled mr brumfield sought to be spared on that ground , but was denied a hearing a state judge reasoned that the evidence submitted at mr brumfield s trial was sufficient to resolve the issue against him even though he had not argued that his intellectual disability was a reason to bar his execution a federal trial judge disagreed after a sevenday hearing , the judge concluded that mr brumfeld s iq and limited abilities to perform basic functions proved that he was disabled the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit , in new orleans , , ruling that the state court had been entitled to rely on the trialcourt record during monday s arguments , several justices seemed inclined to rule in mr brumfield s favor , but on narrow grounds that would give rise to no larger precedent i think you 're making a strong argument that is purely a factual argument about this case , justice samuel a alito jr told mr brumfield s lawyer , michael b desanctis but the case did not require the court to consider categorical rule about when hearings must be held , justice alito said chief justice john g roberts jr seemed to agree that the issue before the court boiled down to a lot of discussion on the evidence at issue in this particular case what is the broader significance of that discussion here \? he asked , suggesting that the answer was none justice stephen g breyer told premila burns , a lawyer for the state , that he was of mixed minds if i had to decide at this moment whether there is enough evidence for you to win on the point is he intellectually disabled , i would say you win , justice breyer said if i have to decide whether or not he presented enough evidence to get a hearing , i would say you lose in a unanimous unsigned opinion in no 14593 , the court ruled that requiring a convicted sex offender to wear a gps device on an ankle for the rest of his life raised concern under the fourth amendment , which bars unreasonable searches and seizures the case involved torrey dale grady , who had twice been convicted of sex offenses that roundtheclock monitoring raised no constitutional issues in asking the court to consider his case , mr grady said the device was not only intrusive but also cumbersome , as it requires him to be plugged into a wall outlet at least once a day for four to six hours at a time the supreme court ruled only that the monitoring amounted to a search under the fourth amendment , returning the case to the lower court for analysis of the question the fourth amendment prohibits only unreasonable searches , the court s unsigned opinion said the reasonableness of a search depends on the totality of the circumstances , including the nature and purpose of the search and the extent to which the search intrudes upon reasonable privacy expectations in a second unanimous and unsigned opinion , in , no 14618 , the court ruled against a michigan inmate serving a life sentence for his role in the killing of a drug dealer the inmate , cory donald , said he had been denied effective assistance of counsel because his lawyer had been absent from the trial for about 10 minutes during testimony concerning other defendants on his return , the lawyer said of the testimony , i had no dog in the race and no interest in that michigan state courts rejected mr donald s request for a new trial , but a federal trial court and a divided panel of the sixth circuit , in cincinnati , sided with mr donald the supreme court reversed , saying that the federal courts had failed to show sufficient deference to their state counterparts as required by limiting federal challenges the law allows federal court to provide relief only when the state court s ruling is at odds with clearly established supreme court precedent that standard had not been satisfied , monday s decision said none of our holdings , it said , address counsel s absence during testimony that is irrelevant within the defendant s own theory of the case
quito , ecuador has turned heads with bold stands on and income inequality he helped broker a historic thaw between the united states and he has shaken up the stodgy brand of the roman  but for all his forays into and deftness at imagemaking , his trip to south america , which begins sunday , will test his skills in what could be a much more difficult task putting parishioners in pews and keeping them there when francis was , becoming the first pontiff from latin america , he was hailed by many as the kind of figure long needed by the catholic church to appeal to its vast base in poorer countries his selection signaled how vital the developing world is to the church s future and offered a way to reverse its erosion in latin america , a region that holds almost 40 percent of the world s catholics but has experienced a steady rise in secularism and competing branches of christianity at the very least , the change of tone by a pope who champions the poor and eschews many of the luxurious trappings of his office , and even poses for selfies with followers has raised the hopes of many churchgoers before , the catholic church was out of reach , said rosario zu iga , a volunteer at a church here who credited francis with a new , more human approach he has touched on very sensitive subjects about the attitude of the church regarding its own mistakes , like sex abuse but whether a change of image at the top will be followed by results on the ground remains a pressing question around the region in argentina , francis' native country , the director of a catholic association said that while the pope had personally ignited excitement and interest , attendance at church services and the number of catholic marriages had barely increased there is an asymmetry , said the director , justo carbajales , 56 , a cardiologist argentines have strengthened ties with the figure of the pope , but still not at all with the church here in the capital of ecuador , where the pope will begin his visit to latin america , archbishop fausto tr vez acknowledged concern over what he called the church s decline in recent decades , including a dwindling number of priests but he said he thought that the pope s influence could be seen through increased attendance at mass , increased collections and a recent rise in the number of seminary students studying to become priests with everything that he says about the poor and about justice , archbishop tr vez said of francis , the young people become motivated he added that many had entered seminary because the pope is doing things that they would like to do latin america and the caribbean have 425 million catholics , 39 percent of the world s total , according to the pew research center but like a multinational corporation facing slumping sales , falling market share , rising competition and a fatigued brand , the church is vulnerable as recently as the early 1970s , at least 90 percent of latin americans were catholic but that number began to fall as protestant churches grew in by the pew center , 69 percent of adults in latin america identified as catholic what was once a gradual shift has become a flood , with catholics now a minority in uruguay and honduras , and at just 50 percent in some other countries , according to the survey , which was based on more than 30 , 000 facetoface interviews in 18 countries and puerto rico in brazil , the country with the world s largest catholic population , 61 percent of adults now identify as catholic , the survey found , but 81 percent said they had been raised catholic that is the landscape francis will face on his first trip as pope to spanishspeaking countries in latin america , with visits to ecuador , bolivia and paraguay it s a free market of faith in latin america , said andrew chesnut , a professor at virginia commonwealth university who was a consultant on the pew survey the catholic monopoly they had for four centuries is over just months after becoming pope , francis attended celebrations of the church s world youth day now , more than two years into his papacy , he returns to the continent of his birth with a message of a church in transformation , having established himself globally as a figure able to provoke both fascination and controversy the said the pope appeared to have delivered a boost to the church , but also said it had no way to measure we have recently observed widespread enthusiasm for the pope and an interest for the church that has been awakened in many countries in the world , including latin america , said the rev federico lombardi , the vatican s spokesman but we do n't have statistics or more precise data on this here in latin america , the pope s influence has extended beyond the religious sphere he played a role last year in secret negotiations between the united states and cuba to restore full diplomatic relations after more than 50 years of hostility , writing letters to encourage the deal and then arranging for a vatican meeting between the two sides president ra l castro of cuba met with francis in may and even declared that he might consider returning to the church in venezuela last year , president nicol s maduro , a leftist whose predecessor , hugo ch vez , had testy relations with the church , has praised francis , noting his advocacy for the poor the shift allowed the vatican s ambassador to foster dialogue between the government and the opposition last year in colombia , officials have talked about their hopes for a visit from francis next year , as possible help in efforts to end more than 50 years of guerrilla war in argentina , where francis , as archbishop of buenos aires , had strained relations with president cristina fern ndez de kirchner , he has mended fences and is often seen as a stabilizing influence for the country and in a particularly notable moment for the region , francis this year cleared the way for the beatification of of el salvador , a defender of the poor who was assassinated in 1980 and is already regarded as a by many nonetheless , the church faces numerous challenges many catholics have left the church for protestant congregations , especially pentecostal churches increasing numbers of people who were raised catholic say that they are no longer associated with any church , especially in countries like uruguay , chile and argentina the church has also been hurt by revelations of sexual abuse of children by priests francis has spoken out strongly on the topic , and he recently approved the to judge bishops accused of covering up or ignoring cases of sexual abuse but in chile , he has been fiercely criticized for naming as bishop a priest who was closely associated with a cleric at the center of a notorious  although the countries that francis will visit share in these regional trends , they have generally seen a more limited shift away from the catholic church , according to the pew survey paraguay registered the highest percentage of adults who identified as catholics , at 89 percent and both paraguay and ecuador have a relatively high percentage of catholics who say that they practice a charismatic form of catholicism which sometimes includes jumping up and raising hands during services , or speaking in tongues a phenomenon that has developed in recent years in response to the rise of pentecostalism the three countries are also among the poorest and smallest in south america , making the pope s visit in keeping with his focus on helping the poor and ministering to those on the periphery and all three , particularly bolivia , have large indigenous populations , which the church is losing if there s any one sector of latin american society who have most abandoned the catholic church , it s been the indigenous population , professor chesnut said he said pentecostal churches had been quick to employ indigenous ministers in countries like guatemala and bolivia , whereas you could count , in many of these countries , the number of indigenous catholic priests on two hands the pope will preside over several masses expected to draw hundreds of thousands of worshipers , and some will include texts in indigenous languages still , the gap is hard to close archbishop tr vez said that although some seminary students in his archdiocese came from indigenous families , none of them speak their native languages as for the visit by francis , archbishop tr vez said , i think that there are lots of people who realize that the pope is coming to rescue the lost sheep
wilmette , ill ten months after graduation , only 60 percent of the law school class of 2014 had found fulltime longterm jobs that required them to pass the bar exam even that improvement over the class of 2013 \( a 57 percent employment rate \) came with three asterisks last year , the changed the jobreporting rules to give law schools an extra month for the class of 2014 to find jobs graduates employed in lawschoolfunded positions count in the employment rate and the number of jobs that require bar passage fell from 2013 to 2014 amazingly \( and perversely \) , law schools have been able to continue to raise tuition while producing nearly twice as many graduates as the job market has been able to absorb how is this possible \? why has n't the market corrected itself \? the answer is that , for a given school , the availability of federal loans for law students has no connection to their poor postgraduation employment outcomes students now amass law school loans averaging 127 , 000 for private schools and 88 , 000 for public ones since 2006 alone , law student debt has surged at inflationadjusted rates of 25 percent for private schools and 34 percent for public schools in may 2014 , the aba created a task force to tackle this problem according to its recent report , 25 percent of law schools obtain at least 88 percent of their total revenues from tuition the average for all law schools is 69 percent so law schools have a powerful incentive to maintain or increase enrollment , even if the employment outcomes are dismal for their graduates , especially at marginal schools the underlying difficulty is that once students pay their tuition bills , law schools have no responsibility for the debt their students have taken on in other words , law schools whose graduates have the greatest difficulty finding jobs that require bar passage are operating without financial accountability and free of the constraints that characterize a functioning market the current subsidy system is keeping some schools in business but the longterm price for students and taxpayers is steep and increasing paradoxically , the task force chairman was dennis w archer , the former mayor of detroit , who is also head of the national policy board of infilaw , a owned consortium of three forprofit law schools arizona summit , charlotte and florida coastal these schools are examples of the larger problem most infilaw 2014 graduates did n't find jobs that required their expensive degrees excluding positions funded by the law school , only 399 percent of arizona summit graduates found fulltime jobs lasting at least a year and requiring bar passage florida coastal s rate was 345 percent at charlotte , it was 341 percent yet as the demand for new lawyers continued to languish from 2011 to 2014 , the size of infilaw s graduating classes almost doubled , to these schools are also among the leaders in creating law student debt arizona summit s 2014 graduates had average law school debt of 187 , 792 at florida coastal , the average was 162 , 785 charlotte s average was 140 , 528 the task force report said that some witnesses proposed capping law , requiring law schools to have skin in the game' by being responsible for loan repayment in certain situations , and even scrapping the current federal student loan program altogether it characterized proponents of such measures as hoping that a kind of fiscal tough love will force schools to become more financially responsible and reduce cost but the task force argued that there seems to be little need to impose the kind of tough love some want because the market is already doing it except that the market is doing no such thing while enrollment did decline to about 38 , 000 last year from 52 , 000 in 2010 , it has not been falling at the pace necessary to reach equilibrium in a stagnant legal job market too many incoming law school students still believe they will be among the lucky few who get decent jobs the task force , having dodged the issues that should have been the focus of its work , offered four suggestions law schools should offer students better debt counseling the department of education should develop plain english disclosure information about student loans the aba should collect and disseminate information about how law schools spend their money and the aba should encourage law schools to experiment on curriculums and programs none of those will make a difference the crisis in legal education is real magical thinking and superficial rhetoric about declining enrollments , better debt counseling for students , and law schools' experimenting with curriculum changes will not create more jobs the aba should treat the challenge seriously and begin to address it with serious solutions so far , that has not happened in fact , earlier this month , the aba house of delegates missed an opportunity to address this issue by giving its rubber stamp of approval to the task force report until student loans bear a rational relationship to individual law school outcomes , law schools will exploit their lack of accountability , the legal education market will remain dysfunctional , and equilibrium between supply and demand will remain elusive the aba calls itself the national voice of the legal profession when it comes to the profession s most urgent problem , it s long past time to speak up
wimbledon , england though the wimbledon women s singles draw is intended to be as symmetrical as possible , the players in the top half have an obstacleriddled road ahead that barely resembles the smoothly paved path the bottom half has become in tuesday s tophalf quarterfinals , no 1ranked , a 20time grand slam singles champion who has won the last three slam events , will take on victoria azarenka , a twotime grand slam champion whom she unseated for the no 1 ranking two years ago the winner of that match will most likely face fourthseeded maria sharapova , a fivetime grand slam champion and a former no 1 williams defeated her sister venus , who has five wimbledon titles to match serena s haul , in the fourth round on monday afterward , serena williams reflected on the uneven draws she believes she often finds herself in i'm on the heavier side , it seems , williams said maybe because i'm one of the heavy hitters , and it makes it heavier but also with maria , victoria and venus , there s a lot of heavy hitters on this side the quarterfinals in the bottom half of this year s draw include four women who have never won a grand slam title or reached the no 1 ranking three of them have never broken into the top 10 in matches that will also be played tuesday , 15thseeded timea bacsinszky will face 20thseeded garbi e muguruza , and 13thseeded agnieszka radwanska will take on 21stseeded madison keys though the players largely play down their improved chances to have careerchanging results , the heightened stakes are reflected in the nervousness of their coaches and agents , who know that opportunities like this rarely come along as marion bartoli showed two years ago , when she won wimbledon as a no 15 seed without having faced a player who was ranked higher than her , an easier path to glory is always welcome still , none of the four women this year can be considered a fluke , all of them having previously been among the final eight in a grand slam radwanska , the only one of the four to have cracked the top 10 or reached a grand slam final she was the runnerup to serena williams here in 2012 advanced with a 75 , 64 win over 28thseeded jelena jankovic , who had ousted petra kvitova , the second seed and the defending champion , in the third round radwanska said it was easy to keep herself focused on each match as it came because anything beyond that could be superseded by an upset it s one match at a time , she said you 're not really thinking what s going to be in the second week or end of the second week of the four quarterfinalists in the bottom half , only muguruza has had to face top10 opposition to reach the quarterfinals , she beat fifthseeded caroline wozniacki , 64 , 64 , on monday she also defeated no 10 angelique kerber in the third round muguruza , who has twice reached the quarterfinals at the , said that nerves were an equalizer at this stage of the tournament it s true that experience helps you , she said but in these types of rounds , everybody is so nervous everybody wants to win so much you just have to fight against this and find your way to achieve the final or win keys , a 20yearold american who reached her first grand slam semifinal in january at the australian open , did not face an opponent ranked in the top 70 in her first four matches though she has not breezed past her opposition as her superior ranking might suggest , keys expressed contentment with her play so far , including a 36 , 64 , 61 win over the 122ndranked qualifier olga govortsova on monday when i'm walking out onto the courts , not only do i feel people are expecting me to win , but i am expecting me to win , keys said that s a different pressure than i'm putting on myself i think i have handled it pretty well so far bacsinszky , who had her grand slam breakthrough a month ago when she reached the semifinals of the french open , said her previously uninspiring results on grass had tempered her expectations at wimbledon , where she had never made it past the second round when she reached the quarterfinals by rallying to beat 48thranked monica niculescu , 16 , 75 , 62 , bacsinszky let out a scream of delight it meant so much to me just to be able to win the last point , she said it s nice to win a match
i envy you , says james march , in his clipped midatlantic cadence , my curse was making my fortune too early my point being , that the appetites of the filthy rich are specific , altered from that of the common man this might be the complaint of the original resident homicidal maniac of the hotel cortez , but could this not also be the plight of american horror story hotel \? whose appetites are being satisfied by such shallow gestures \? the question of camp and its relation to horror both are equally able of going beyond what most common men gay , straight and everyone in between would consider to be in good taste , but i also believe that horror and camp can still service story in fact , horror helps us have conversations through analogy that would be too didactic otherwise race , in night of the living dead , for instance , or the dangers of sexual promiscuity in the recent indie hit , it follows but how scary is american horror story hotel \? not very , as the times critic neil genzlinger  perhaps you 'll recall the academy award nominated film se7en , about a chilling serial killer who punished victims for indulging in the seven deadly sins , in which a young detective receives his pregnant wife s severed head in a box , is now considered classic it s horrifying and memorable because we never see what s in the box in this week s episode of american horror story , we learn we are tracking a killer whose victims are chosen for breaking the ten commandments for instance , an oscar blogger is sodomized to death with an academy award , for worshiping false idols we see crime scene photos we see a bloodied golden statuette if what truly scares us is often what we do n't , or ca n't , see , it s no wonder that this episode offered little in terms of fright \( i will make an exception for sarah paulson s bloody gums \) two episodes in , hotel has so many disparate plotlines , each taxed with its own clunky exposition , that the story of the show s characters and larger themes are floundering , while the plot races from event to event , with little interest in who these people are or what is happening when you ca n't get too bothered by a fashion show that seems to appear out of nowhere , and introduces yet another glamorous guest star \( this time , infamous supermodel naomi campbell \) , and then vanishes completely from the screen and story , there is a problem what has always been impressive about american horror story , is its success at bringing horror , a genre that is most effectively experienced in the cinema , into the home in part by focusing on the intimate havoc we can wreak on those closest to us , be it a new family in an old house , a coterie of inmates , a coven , a traveling band of freaks these are horrors that the common viewer can appreciate the pain divorce can inflict on children , the crushed hopes of a fading matriarch , and yes , being raped by an anonymous ghost in a rubber suit and spawning the antichrist the rubber man plotline of season 1 , while ridiculous , worked first , it was not sharing story space with a handful of other equally insane plotlines it was , for lack of a better term , the headliner when ghost tate raped vivien harmon , it was the traumatic event the entire season revolved around it was an outrageous plot point that was saved from being nihilistically gratuitous by showing actual emotional consequences for nearly all the characters of murder house it was n't titillating , it was upsetting compare that with the gratuitously extended shot of a character who had just been introduced , being raped in this season s premiere thus far , hotel has earned none of the violence and depravity that it has flaunted while expressing zero interest in subtlety or mystery , but the season is young and i have hope \( i am also crossing my fingers that all these nearly identical white men look alike for a reason , namely bearing a resemblance to the countess' lost maker \) as far i can tell , the only mystery going thus far is how sewing dead bodies into old mattresses brings back the dead so perhaps here is where horror and camp begin to work against each other can anything that preens so glibly in the spotlight s glare truly be scary \?
south carolina has become the first state to aimed at thwarting an international pro economic and disinvestment campaign intended to penalize illinois will soon become the second , and advocates say plans are underway for similar laws in 18 more states in washington , congress could vote this month with language that would encourage the blacklisting of foreign companies that support the pro campaign , known as boycott , divest and sanction , or bds the trade legislation is notable in part because the scope of its blacklisting could include companies that refuse to do business with israeli settlements in the occupied territories , even though they are widely considered illegal and in las vegas this weekend , who is one of the israeli government s most important american supporters , is convening to devise new strategies for countering bds , particularly on american college campuses , where it has gained some support since the gaza war last summer alarmed over what they see as the growing influence of bds , israel s advocates in the united states , mirroring the reaction among many in israel , are scrambling to respond some have embraced a call by the new israeli justice minister , ayelet shaked , to boycott the boycotters the extent of bds s popularity is hard to assess in the united states , where support for israel remains overwhelmingly strong something that boycott organizers concede still , the campaign s effort to isolate israel economically even if it has yet to show any practical impact has struck a nerve among many american jews they see the effort as a form of antisemitism , an accusation that bds supporters call a false , cynical and divisive scare tactic , executive director of the israel allies foundations , an advocacy group that contributed to the effort to pass the law in south carolina , described it as an important answer to the bds campaign the timing and importance of this groundbreaking legislation cannot be overstated , he said in a statement after gov nikki r haley signed it on thursday under that law , all public entities in the state are prohibited from doing business with anyone who supports a boycott of any south carolina trading partner boycott organizers describe their movement as a nonviolent strategy modeled on the tenets of gandhi and the rev dr martin luther king jr , aimed at pressuring israel to end its occupation and control of territories seized in the 1967 war so that palestinians can have their own state supporters of the campaign describe the antibds trade legislation as a barometer of their success so far in calling attention to what they see as blatant injustices against palestinians the by prime minister benjamin netanyahu of israel , in the eyes of its supporters , speaks volumes about his anxiety over its potential no matter what netanyahu says by trying to divert discussion to attack this group , that cannot cover the fact that his government is involved in illegal activities in the occupied territories , especially in settlements , riyad h mansour , the palestinian ambassador to the united nations , said friday in a telephone interview it cannot be defended , including by legislators in the united states of america boycott leaders call their effort analogous to the disinvestment campaign against south africa s apartheid system in the 1980s as was the case back then , successful organizing led by american college students to pass nonbinding resolutions on divestment or product boycotts have increased rahim kurwa , a graduate student of sociology at the university of california , los angeles , and a member of students for justice in palestine , an advocacy group , keeps a running tally of successful bds campus resolutions and referendums that have received a majority vote by his count there have been 13 successes so far this year , compared with seven in 2014 and four in 2013 mr kurwa said the increased presence of bds organizers on campuses was particularly worrisome to advocates of israel who have responded partly by offering student leaders free trips to israel to influence their opinion these trips typically emphasize the country s diversity and tolerance , countering the palestinian allegations of oppression a lot of the response to the bds movement has been sort of an indirect response , mr kurwa said there s sort of a lack of ideas that would compete with the international pressure on israel instead , they 're trying to promote a good image of israel that says , there s no problem here there s nothing to fix' the antibds trade legislation efforts in states and in congress , mr kurwa said , are part of a new strategy by israel s advocates , but none of these things gets back to a solution to end the occupation the parallel drawn by the propalestinian campaign to the antiapartheid struggle offends many israelis and their supporters , who see israel as a beacon of democracy and morality surrounded by hostility , mayhem and malevolence many also say the boycott effort is a duplicitous way of seeking to delegitimize israel bds is the most extreme thing you can do , said thane rosenbaum , senior fellow and director of the forum on law , culture and society at the new york university school of law the language used by bds supporters to describe israel , he said , is ignorant and absurd , if not antisemitic mr rosenbaum , who will participate in a panel on antisemitism this weekend at an annual conference in new york sponsored by the jerusalem post , said he believed that the bds movement in the united states was limited to universities and some intellectual magazines , but that nonetheless , bds is always the elephant in the room mr kurwa said the effort by many israel supporters to equate bds with antisemitism was really sad and unfortunate there are three choices a palestinian state , palestinian citizenship , or more occupation , he said we 're either going to have the status quo , or something else bds is really about picking
since its founding in 2004 , the middle eastern art and culture magazine bidoun has presented a distinctive , technicolor vision of a complex region it has given voice to important , analyzed , documented egypt s tahrir square uprising , and published interviews with the and the gallerist it even explored the influence of star wars on saddam hussein s son uday this month , bidoun put of thousands of stories and artworks online with free access and asked cultural figures , including the turkish nobel laureate orhan pamuk and the curator hans ulrich obrist , to create small of their favorites the archive , at turns zany and poignant , is a photo album of a long and dramatic decade , from the aftermath of sept 11 to the reverberations of the arab spring bidoun was born of a particular moment the post 9 11 period and was founded by a bunch of people who are middle eastern in a broad sense , said negar azimi , a senior editor she described her cohort as people who grew up speaking multiple languages , maybe all of them badly , or who came of age listening to heavy metal in tehran or in kuwait ms azimi , who is iranianamerican and grew up in europe and the united states , added our vision of the mideast extends to india , it extends to la it certainly does n't fulfill the expectations of the clash of civilizations' vision that s so pervasive for a magazine whose circulation has never gone above 10 , 000 , bidoun has had an outsize influence , especially in the art world bidoun s arrival was a clear signal that a new digital cosmopolitanism had arrived with the early aughts , said stuart comer , the chief curator of media and performance art at the museum of modern art conceived in the spirit of an era in which citizenship is no longer a secure certainty , he said , it has become a hub for a sprawling network of artists , writers , curators and designers who he said are also drawn to offerings like , at the ashkal alwan cultural center in beirut the

iranianamerican who was then living in europe i felt like i was without a place , she said i belong to many places and none that was when i found that word it meant a lot to me ms farjam s father , a businessman based in dubai , backed the magazine until it became a nonprofit in 2010 , based in new york the magazine s most recent print edition came out in 2013 since then , its staff members , all but one of whom are now volunteers , have been working on curatorial projects and events with institutions including , the in beirut and the serpentine gallery in london over the years , bidoun has been a testing ground for artists including the frenchmoroccan and , who is half bedouin arab , half american and whose work in bidoun later became her 2012 memoir , next year , she is to have at the whitney museum the magazine has also allowed readers to rediscover the writer and artist , who was born in 1925 and whose life traces the complexities of the arab situation in the 20th century \( ms adnan was in bidoun and also wrote on from beirut and morocco that influenced her in the '50s and '60s , an era of transformation across the arab world \) in bidoun in 2008 , the chicagobased american artist michael rakowitz did called strike the empire back , about saddam hussein s son uday and his obsession with star wars the first iraqi screening of star wars is believed to have been held at a private event at saddam hussein s baath party headquarters in march 1980 , six months before the start of the iraniraq war , and the 15yearold uday attended in 1995 , uday formed the fedayeen saddam ,

brother qusay in 2010 , mr rakowitz s piece became part of an exhibition of his work  in 2011 , bidoun produced uprising that led to the toppling of president hosni mubarak of egypt , before the in 2014 called a rather brief moment in time , the issue is fractured , impressionistic like a french film , said michael c vazquez , a senior editor the aim , he added , was to capture whatever it means to betray a moment of revolutionary possibility to make the issue , bidoun held meetings , often at cairo s , and produced a kind of oral history interview subjects included teenage bloggers newspaper editors a tour guide at the \( the issue also featured lists of artworks stolen from it during the uprising \) a journalist whose books on the mubaraks had been banned and the egyptian novelist , whose selfpublished novel revolution 2053 in some ways anticipated the rebellion bidoun has also sought to broaden the conventions of travel writing by giving space to writers who are often hard to categorize it published the kenyan author reflecting on the viral success of his granta essay , and personal essays by the los angelesbased writer , a former editor in chief of africanacom and the indian writer and the cultural critic  in 2009 , bidoun began a library project , a collection of about 3 , 000 books ranging from pulp fiction to more intellectual works , that documents the innumerable ways that people have depicted and defined that is , slandered , celebrated , obfuscated , hyperbolized , ventriloquized , photographed , surveyed , and or exhumed the vast , vexed , nefarious construct known as the middle east , ' the magazine s website reads the library has been put on view in six cities , including at the new museum in new york and the carnegie international in pittsburgh bidoun was sold at highend bookshops from new york to paris but often struggled with distribution in the middle east putting the archives online is a way to reach more readers so many times someone said , oh i wish i could see that issue' and now it s finally there , ms farjam , the founding editor , said now it s cemented in the ether forever

green bay , wis the nfl loves to trumpet that its players can overcome anything , including subzero temperatures and howling winds so it is no surprise that the divisional playoff game between the and here has been called ice bowl ii , a reference to the last time these teams met at lambeau field in the postseason in 1967 but this matchup will be far from a repeat of that game , which the packers won , 2117 the weather at kickoff is expected to be about 20 degrees and sunny with light winds , a far cry from the wind chill of minus 46 degrees registered nearly half a century ago playing conditions have changed , too players now wear lightweight , hightech uniforms and undergarments that better insulate they sit on heated benches and dry their helmets nearby under the field is a network of pipes with a solution that includes antifreeze to warm the grass with these and other modern improvements , the players are shrugging off the weather even the packers , who might otherwise want to crow that their team is more acclimated to the elements we 'll be warm on the sidelines , they 'll be warm on the sidelines and then when you get on the field , you do n't even think of the weather , packers fullback john kuhn said we like the cold weather , we thrive in the cold weather , but we 're facing a really tough opponent it is clear the packers thrive in the cold weather , but they usually thrive whatever the weather in the past 10 seasons , the packers have a 138 record in regularseason games played in 30 degrees or lower , according to elias sports bureau that is a 619 winning percentage , only slightly above the 613 winning percentage green bay has for all its regularseason games during that 10year span the advantage in the playoffs is also slim in the last decade , the packers are 32 during the postseason in games played in belowfreezing temperatures , and their overall playoff record during that period is 65 some of the packers have been watching footage of the 1967 ice bowl game to lift their spirits , and for good reason it was a gritty game with a thrilling finish , and it has come to symbolize the determination of the teams coached by vince lombardi but it is also ancient history to players whose parents might not have been old enough to watch the game we get hit in the face with the history of the green bay packers stuff , said packers kicker mason crosby , 30 , who grew up in texas , and it s an easy game to go back to because it s iconic but it s something of a different time the players do prepare to brave the elements because it snowed in green bay during the week , crosby was unable to practice in lambeau field instead , he kicked in the team s practice facility nearby , with the doors open to allow in a breeze and cold air about two hours before the game , he will kick some balls on the field to get a feel for the way the wind is blowing during the game , he will take a few extra practice kicks on the sideline to keep his feet warm he will avoid sitting on the heated benches too long when you get that burst of warmth , you get colder when you walk away from them , he said in the past decade , the cowboys have played just three regularseason games \( and none in the playoffs \) in temperatures of 30 degrees or lower , and they lost all three , according to elias but they are undefeated on the road this season , which matches the packers' 80 home record , and dallas quarterback tony romo grew up in southern wisconsin some players will wear an extra layer under their uniform and perhaps adjust the number of cleats in their shoes to for better traction they also play mind games to get themselves ready you prepare mentally , cowboys defensive end jeremy mincey said last tuesday you just tell yourself it s not cold and you start doing that now
washington since to secretive and duplicitous regimes are in fashion , we would like to post an open letter to the leaders of the clinton republic of chappaqua it has come to our attention while observing your machinations during your attempted restoration that you may not fully understand our constitutional system thus , we are writing to bring to your attention two features of our democracy the importance of preserving historical records and the illadvised gluttony of an american feminist icon wallowing in regressive middle eastern states' payola you should seriously consider these characteristics of our nation as the campaignthatmustnotbenamed progresses if you , hillary rodham clinton , are willing to cite your mother s funeral to get sympathy for illadvisedly deleting 30 , 000 emails , it just makes us want to sigh ok , just take it if you want it that bad , go ahead and be president and leave us in peace \( or war , if you have your hawkish way \) you 're still idling on the runway , but we 're already jetlagged it s all so drearily familiar that i know we 're only moments away from james carville writing a column in david brock s media matters , headlined , in private , hillary s really a hoot when you grin and call out to your supporters , like at the emily s list anniversary gala , do n't you someday want to see a woman president of the united states of america \? the answer is yes , it would be thrilling but therein lies the rub what is the tradeoff that will be exacted by the chappaqua republic for that yearnedfor moment \? when the rogue state of bill began demonizing monica lewinsky as a troubled stalker , you knew you could count on the complicity of feminists and democratic women in congress bill s female cabinet members and feminist supporters had no choice but to accept the unappetizing quid pro quo the clintons would give women progressive public policies as long as the women did n't assail bill for his regressive private behavior with women now you , hillary , are following the same disheartening we 'll make you an offer you ca n't refuse pattern you started the guernica press conference defending your indefensible droit du seigneur over your state department emails by referring to women s rights and denouncing the letter to iran from republican senators as out of step with the best traditions of american leadership none of what you said made any sense keeping a single account mingling business and personal with your own server was n't about convenience it was about expedience you became judge and jury on what s relevant because you did n't want to leave digital fingerprints for others to retrace you could have had huma carry two devices if you really could n't hoist an extra few ounces you insisted on piggybacking on bill s server , even though about hackers , because you were gaming the system for 2016 \( or even 2012 \) suffused with paranoia and preemptive defensiveness , you shrugged off the one s highminded call for the most transparent administration in history it depends upon what the meaning of is the subtext of your news conference cut through the flimsy rationales like a dagger you can have the first woman president you can get rid of those epically awful republicans who have vandalized congress , marginalized the president and jeopardized our iran policy you can get a more progressive american society but , in return , you must accept our foibles and protect us you exploit our better angels and our desire for a finer country and our fear of the anarchists and haters in congress because you assume that if it s good for the clintons , it s good for the world , you 're always tangling up government policy with your own needs , desires , deceptions , marital bargains and gremlins instead of raising us up by behaving like exemplary , sterling people , you bring us down to your own level , a place of blurred lines and fungible ethics and sleazy associates your family s foundation gobbles tens of millions from saudi arabia and other repressive regimes , whose unspoken message is we 're going to give you money to go improve the world now leave us alone to go persecute women that s an uncomfortable echo of a clintonian tradeoff , which goes we 're going to give you the first woman president who will improve the country now leave us alone to break any rules we please bill , your pathology is more human and interesting it s almost like you need to create messes to see if your extraordinary political gifts can get you out of them it s a fatherless boy s how much do you love me \? syndrome do you love me enough to let me get away with hillary , your syndrome is less mortal , more regal , a matter of what is hillary owed \? ronald reagan seemed like an ancient king , as one aide put it , gliding across the landscape you seem like an annoyed queen , radiating irritation at anyone who tries to hold you accountable you 're less rhetorically talented than bill but more controlling , so it s harder for you to navigate out of tough spots no drama obama and his advisers are clearly appalled to be drawn into your shadowy shenanigans , just as al gore once was whatever else you say about this president , he has no shadows we hope this letter enriches your knowledge of our constitutional system and promotes mutual understanding and clarity as the campaign progresses sincerely , america
updated , 2 15 pm mistakes are bound to happen in the news business , but some are worse than others what i ll lay out here was a bad one it involved a failure of sufficient skepticism at every level of the reporting and editing process especially since the story in question relied on anonymous government sources , as too many times articles do here s the background a times article sunday reported that the us government had missed something that was right out there in the open the jihadist socialmedia posts by one of the san bernardino killers its initial paragraphs read as follows tashfeen malik , who with her husband carried out the massacre in san bernardino , calif , passed three background checks by american immigration officials as she moved to the united states from pakistan none uncovered what ms malik had made little effort to hide that she talked openly on social media about her views on violent jihad she said she supported it and she said she wanted to be a part of it it was certainly damning and it was wrong on wednesday , the fbi director , james b comey , referred to such reporting as a garble and , as it turns out from his statements and from further reporting , ms malik had not posted openly on social media she had written emails she had written private messages , not visible to the public and she had written on a dating site in other words , the story s clear implication that those who vetted ms malik s visa had missed the boat a clearly visible ocean liner was based on a false premise on thursday evening , an editors note was appended to the article it appeared in friday s paper editors notes are sometimes used instead of corrections to provide more context and explanation but there s no question that this also functioned as a correction even before the editors note appeared , readers were writing to me with their concerns nancy cadet , who described herself as a longtime subscriber , wanted to know how this happened were these reporters relying on tips from a noncredible source \? and she observed , quite correctly , that harm is done when the times gets it wrong the falsehoods and their repercussions live on long after the stories have been corrected or disputed she s right erik wemple of the washington post , who wrote early and often on this all week , noted that the story set fire to the news system all sorts of followup reports surfaced and straight into the political arena it went it wasn t long , he added , before republican presidential candidate ted cruz was using it to bash democrats and there s been a lot of commentary esquire saw source pollution as the problem mother jones wrote that two of the reporters should be considered on probation \( not dismissed , as an earlier version of this post said \) and salon called it an epic reporting fail with dire national consequences i have two major and rather simple questions how did this happen \? and how can the times guard against its happening again \? \( as many readers have noted , some very critically , two of the authors of this article , matt apuzzo and michael s schmidt , also wrote the flawed story in july that reported that hillary clinton would be the target of a criminal investigation by the justice department because of her email practices while secretary of state reporting by the third reporter on the current article , julia preston , who covers immigration , was restricted to the visavetting process \) i talked on friday to the executive editor , dean baquet to one of his chief deputies , matt purdy and to the washington editor , bill hamilton , who edited the article all described what happened as deeply troubling mr baquet said that some new procedures need to be put in place , especially for dealing with anonymous sources , and he said he would begin working on that immediately this was a really big mistake , mr baquet said , and more than anything since i ve become editor it does make me think we need to do something about how we handle anonymous sources he added this was a system failure that we have to fix however , mr baquet said it would not be realistic or advisable to ban anonymous sources entirely from the times how did this specific mistake happen \? our sources misunderstood how social media works and we didn t push hard enough , said mr baquet , who read the article before publication he said those sources apparently did not know the difference between public and private messages on socialmedia platforms i asked him why reporters or editors had not insisted on seeing or reading the social media posts in question , or even having them read aloud to them he told me he thought that this would have been unrealistic under the circumstances , but that without that kind of direct knowledge , more caution was required mr purdy said we need to have a red flag on such stories he said he believed the times has an overreliance on anonymous sources mr hamilton sees another lesson , too when we don t know the details , as we didn t here , there s probably a reason for that , he said he added we didn t see the dangers all the editors said that slowing down , despite the highly competitive nature of a hot news story , is a necessary measure mr baquet staunchly defended mr schmidt and mr apuzzo \( who , he noted , won a pulitzer prize for investigative reporting at the associated press on the new york police s surveillance of muslims \) , calling them really fine reporters who have broken a lot of great stories in recent months mr hamilton agreed , and noted that mr apuzzo and mr schmidt cover two of the most sensitive beats in washington national security and law enforcement , respectively , including the fbi mr baquet rejected the idea that the sources had a political agenda that caused them to plant falsehoods there s no reason to think that s the case , he said the times needs to fix its overuse of unnamed government sources and it needs to slow down the reporting and editing process , especially in the feverpitch atmosphere surrounding a major news event those are procedural changes , and they are needed but most of all , and more fundamental , the paper needs to show far more skepticism a kind of prosecutorial scrutiny at every level of the process two frontpage , anonymously sourced stories in a few months have required editors notes that corrected key elements elements that were integral enough to form the basis of the headlines in both cases that s not acceptable for times readers or for the paper s credibility , which is its most precious asset if this isn t a red alert , i don t know what will be

a billboard will go up sometime before the red bulls' home opener on march 22 , right by exit 16 on i280 , the main access road to red bull arena in harrison , nj it will denounce the club s new management team and its austrian energydrinkselling ownership most notably , it will profess support not for the team s new coach , jesse marsch , but for his ousted predecessor the billboard is part of an unusual fan revolt long one of mls s biggest spenders even as their trophy case remained frustratingly empty , the red bulls have seen their relationship with their fans tumble in recent weeks the cause of the furor was the unexpected firing of mike petke as coach on jan 7 , but the grievances are old and varied a revolving door of 14 coaches in 19 seasons , a history of signing marquee players who or , and a persistent lack of playoff success explanations from team officials have done little to calm fans surprised by the reaction to the coaching change , the red bulls organized a townhall meeting with 300 seasonticket holders and many vented their anger at the team answering criticism that management had done little to improve the roster in the offseason , the red bulls announced this week , including  it remains to be seen if any of the recent decisions will quiet those fans agitating for an even bigger change an end to red bull s ownership of the team red bull bought the metrostars , as they were then called , in 2006 and rebranded them while red bull has invested significantly in a stadium and players , some fans say they are fed up with the team s failure to develop into a consistent title contender the sudden departure of petke , who was fired only weeks before preseason training , by the red bulls' new sporting director , ali curtis , may have been intended to signal a new direction for the team instead , it blindsided not only the popular petke but also his players scores of fans asked for refunds for their season tickets , though none were given , a common policy in sports others began an online fundraising campaign for the billboard it took seven hours to reach the 3 , 200 target ultimately , 5 , 500 was raised a lot of the fan base has had to compromise in supporting this team because of the odious situation of being owned by a company whose main goal is selling energy drinks , said mike vallo , 26 , a writer who helped organize the billboard campaign they 've just made mistake after mistake the petke firing was the last straw for a lot of people marsch this week began the difficult job of replacing petke by gathering his stillforming team in orlando , fla several key players , including kljestan and midfielder tim cahill , remain absent i knew that mike was a fan favorite , and for all the right reasons , marsch said of petke this week the level at which a lot of the emotion was exemplified was probably higher than i expected but no problem , and i respected people for saying what they thought not only was marsch s appointment unpopular , but the red bulls will most likely open the season without a marquee player the star striker thierry henry retired after the team was eliminated from the playoffs last season , and cahill , who is playing for australia at the asian cup this month , may not return to the club for the final year of his contract combined , they earned about 8 million annually , meaning the team s payroll , , is expected to be significantly smaller than last year s total of about 113 million whereas the red bulls were once in the conversation for every major star making noises about coming to mls , this month they had to admit that the united states national team striker jozy altidore was out of their price range \( altidore \) instead the red bulls will add kljestan , a veteran of the champions league with the belgian club anderlecht and a former teammate of marsch s at the now defunct chivas usa marsch , 41 , is well regarded as a soccer mind after a 14year mls playing career , a stint as a national team assistant coach and a commendable season in charge of the expansion montreal impact in 2012 he preaches the sort of fluid and zippy soccer that the red bulls have regularly aspired to but rarely delivered his philosophy and willingness to innovate were ultimately why marsch was preferred to petke , whose teams often played a more labored style so , too , was his eagerness to embrace the commitment to analytics favored by curtis as he remakes the team the traditional role of a head coach has changed , curtis said and if you do n't evolve and have a coach that can embrace different ways of thinking and ways of improving your club , we 'd be left behind in the next three to four years that is particularly important this year because the most recent rebooting of the red bulls will take place amid competition in the marketplace an mls expansion team , new york city fc , will offer fans a natural rival , and an alternative this is a big club and a wonderful opportunity for me , marsch said as much as you could talk about the reduction of payroll and superstars and everything else , this is still a club that should be successful , can be successful , and when we get it right , i think the rewards will be massive
the 2016 campaign should be almost entirely about issues the parties are far apart on everything from the environment to fiscal policy to health care , and history tells us that is a good guide to how they will govern nonetheless , many in the news media will try to make the campaign about personalities and character instead and character is n't totally irrelevant the next president will surely encounter issues that are n't currently on anyone s agenda , so it matters how he or she is likely to react but the character trait that will matter most is n't one the press likes to focus on in fact , it s actively discouraged you see , you should n't care whether a candidate is someone you 'd like to have a beer with nor should you care about politicians' sex lives , or even their spending habits unless they involve clear corruption no , what you should really look for , in a world that keeps throwing nasty surprises at us , is intellectual integrity the willingness to face facts even if they 're at odds with one s preconceptions , the willingness to admit mistakes and change course and that s a virtue in very short supply as you might guess , i'm thinking in particular about the sphere of economics , where the nasty surprises just keep coming if nothing that has happened these past seven years or so has shaken any of your longheld economic beliefs , either you have n't been paying attention or you have n't been honest with yourself times like these call for a combination of openmindedness willingness to entertain different ideas and determination to do the best you can , the country demands bold , persistent experimentation it is common sense to take a method and try it if it fails , admit it frankly and try another but above all , try something what we see instead in many public figures is , however , the behavior believing things which we know to be untrue , and then , when we are finally proved wrong , impudently twisting the facts so as to show that we were right did i predict runaway inflation that never arrived \? well , the government is cooking the books , and besides , i never said what i said just to be clear , i'm not calling for an end to ideology in politics , because that s impossible everyone has an ideology , a view about how the world does and should work indeed , the most reckless and dangerous ideologues are often those who imagine themselves ideologyfree for example , selfproclaimed centrists and are , therefore , unaware of their own biases what you should seek , in yourself and others , is not an absence of ideology but an open mind , willing to consider the possibility that parts of the ideology may be wrong the press , i'm sorry to say , tends to punish openmindedness , because gotcha journalism is easier and safer than policy analysis in the 1990s , but now she s critical it s a flipflop ! or , possibly , a case of learning from experience , which is something we should praise , not deride so what s the state of intellectual integrity at this point in the election cycle \? pretty bad , at least on the republican side of the field jeb bush , for example , has declared that on foreign policy , but the list of advisers circulated by his aides included the likes of paul wolfowitz , , and shows no signs of having learned from the blood bath that actually took place meanwhile , as far as i can tell that none of the terrible consequences that were supposed to follow health reform mass cancellation of existing policies , soaring premiums , job destruction has actually happened the point is that we 're not just talking about being wrong on specific policy questions we 're talking about never admitting error , and never revising one s views never being able to say that you were wrong is a serious character flaw even if the consequences of that refusal to admit error fall only on a few people but moral cowardice should be outright disqualifying in anyone seeking high office think about it suppose , as is all too possible , that the next president ends up confronting some kind of crisis economic , environmental , foreign undreamed of in his or her current political philosophy we really , really do n't want the job of responding to that crisis dictated by someone who still ca n't bring himself to admit that invading iraq was a disaster but health reform was n't i still think this election should turn almost entirely on the issues but if we must talk about character , let s talk about what matters , namely intellectual integrity
during the often meandering and repetitious argument at the on tuesday , there was one galvanizing , clarifying moment that has n't received much attention but that , at least for me , put everything in perspective it was the response that solicitor general gave to a suggestion by chief justice that the court should simply stay its hand and permit the truly extraordinary pace of social change to continue on its own to set the scene shortly before mr verrilli rose for his 15 minutes at the lectern to argue for samesex marriage on behalf of the obama administration , chief justice roberts had remarked to mary l bonauto , the lawyer for the couples in the four cases before the court , that events were , after all , moving in her direction his implication was that she and her clients should be patient , and for their own good people feel very differently about something if they have a chance to vote on it than if it s imposed on them by the courts , the chief justice said it was a comment , not a question , and one not even addressed to the solicitor general but mr verrilli , an experienced supreme court advocate well before he became the government s top appellate lawyer , seized on it as an invitation to frame his own argument in the , his response takes up a rare uninterrupted paragraph that is worth quoting in full i think it s important to understand that if this court concludes that this issue should be left to the political process , what the court will be saying is that the demeaning , secondclass status that gay and lesbian couples now inhabit in states that do not provide for marriage is consistent with the equal protection of the laws that is not a waitandsee that is a validation in other words it s too late for waitandsee by staying its hand at this point , solicitor general verrilli went on to explain , the court would leave the country with something that will approximate the nation as a house divided that we had with de jure racial segregation it s too late for waitandsee because the country has already traveled so far down the road to marriage equality , with hundreds of thousands of children being raised by samesex parents , with hundreds of major corporate employers signing on to the cause in a brief filed with the court , with approval of samesex marriage surging in the polls i do n't know what the latest opinion polls show , chief justice roberts mused during the argument ok , 61 percent approval and climbing , as of last week as the justices surely know , the supreme court itself has been a partner in this great social revolution it did n't look that way not so long ago in 1972 , in a case called , the justices voted unanimously to dismiss out of hand a claim brought by a student leader at the university of minnesota , jack baker , for the constitutional right to marry the man who would become his life partner , james mcconnell the appeal is dismissed for want of a substantial federal question , was all the court had to say about the case listening to the argument on tuesday , i was curious to see what today s court made of baker v nelson the oneline order by which the court disposed of the case in 1972 , and which it has never formally repudiated , stands , as a technical matter , as a kind of precedent it lacks the weight of a fullfledged opinion but it s not nothing , either judges who are so inclined can rely on it for the proposition that the constitution has nothing to say about a right to samesex marriage in fact , in the case now before the court , , judge jeffrey s sutton of the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit did just that in november in his majority opinion upholding the samesex marriage bans in michigan , ohio , kentucky and tennessee invoking baker v nelson , judge sutton had this to say it matters not whether we think the decision was right in its time , remains right today , or will be followed by the court in the future only the supreme court may overrule its own precedents , and we remain bound even by its summary decisions until such time as the court informs us that we are not the court has yet to inform us that we are not , and we have no license to engage in a guessing game about whether the court will change its mind or , more aggressively , to assume authority over baker ourselves that was not , it bears emphasis , the only way to look at the continuing precedential value of baker v nelson last september , two months before judge sutton s opinion , judge richard a posner wrote an opinion for the united states court of appeals for the seventh circuit striking down the samesex marriage bans in indiana and wisconsin baker was decided in 1972 , judge posner wrote in , 42 years ago and the dark ages so far as litigation over discrimination against homosexuals is concerned he said the supreme court s subsequent decisions , including in 2003 , in which the court gave constitutional protection to private samesex conduct , and , which struck down part of the defense of marriage act two years ago , make clear that baker is no longer authoritative we should be for creating the lowercourt conflict that impelled the supreme court to take up the samesex marriage question during tuesday s argument , no justice mentioned baker v nelson it is a nonprecedent , a noncase , no matter how the court decides the ultimate issue \( for what it s worth , i share the conventional wisdom that marriage equality will win the day , although there may not be five justices on the same doctrinal page in reaching that result \) how did the supreme court relegate baker v nelson to the junkyard of history without ever saying explicitly that it was doing so \? judge posner s invocation of the intervening decisions provides part of the answer but it s not the whole story \( nor am i suggesting that he thinks it is \) what happened was that a powerful social movement propelled the issue and placed itself in dialogue with the courts there were setbacks , to be sure , but incrementally , inexorably , in the hands of some brilliant social movement strategists and some judges willing to hear them , constitutional change happened in the courtroom on tuesday , there was surprisingly little discussion of legal doctrine almost none , actually was that because formal doctrine the confusing tiers of scrutiny in equal protection analysis , the definition of fundamental rights deemed worthy of protection under the due process clause has little to offer at this point \? because reality has outpaced doctrine , and the court s only role is to catch up \? maybe so we 'll have the answer in about two months wait and see
nashville the ' challenge is to recast an aging team with a bloated payroll after years of lavish spending like all teams , they crave young , athletic players with reasonable contracts but those players can rarely be bought so the yankees have sat out the freeagent market , for a change , and on tuesday engineered another deal for the kind of player they need starlin castro is their new second baseman , arriving in a trade with the for pitcher adam warren and a player to be named castro is a threetime allstar who turns 26 in march you want to get younger , athletic and good , general manager brian cashman said that s what we 're trying to do it s always been a priority i 'll be honest it s harder to do cashman would not attribute that difficulty to playing in new york , because the mets reached the last world series with a roster of mostly young stars but he framed the yankees' strategy in different terms the mets , he said , went through a lot to get to where they are now , so it can be done it just has n't and is n't part of our dna to accept that fullblown commitment to a rebuild , cashman went on ownership s comfort level is walking that tightrope , rather than tear down and live to fight another day the public stated goal is to get younger and compete for the championship every year that s what we 're trying to do the first part of that mandate , cashman explained , is why the yankees did not try to sign the versatile ben zobrist they could have traded warren and rob refsnyder to oakland for zobrist last summer but decided it was too high a price for a rental zobrist went to kansas city and helped the royals beat the mets in the world series zobrist s decision on tuesday to sign with the cubs , for four years and 56 million , hurt the mets , who badly wanted him it also helped the yankees , because the cubs needed a place to dump castro s contract , which will pay him 38 million through 2019 the yankees , who tried to trade for castro last summer , were happy to oblige castro , who has played six seasons already , has had a sub300 onbase percentage in two of the last three years he is a free swinger , cashman conceded , but a contact free swinger castro had 91 strikeouts in 578 plate appearances last season , and has hit at least 10 homers in each of the last five seasons he s a very talented guy , said jim hendry , a top cashman adviser and former cubs general manager and offensively , i think we all think his better days are ahead of him history will tell you that at 26 to 32 or 33 , you 've got a chance to be your most productive very athletic kid castro led the national league in hits in 2011 and thrived last season after moving from shortstop to second base in august castro hit 353 in 47 games after the switch , which cashman said the yankees had always believed he could make now the yankees can pair castro up the middle with shortstop didi gregorius , who was acquired in a trade last offseason and also turns 26 soon their november acquisition , outfielder aaron hicks , who arrived in a trade with minnesota , turned 26 in october all are standout athletes , like jacoby ellsbury and brett gardner , who are older but when healthy form a dynamic top of the order i think it s important , manager joe girardi said on tuesday , before the castro deal we have some really good athletes when you look at the gardys and ells and didi and then we have some players that are home run hitters that do n't run quite as well we added hicks , who i think is a great athlete he will help that of course , castro and hicks do nothing to help the rotation the free agents david price \( boston \) , zack greinke \( arizona \) , jordan zimmermann \( detroit \) , jeff samardzija \( san francisco \) , john lackey \( cubs \) and hisashi iwakuma \( los angeles dodgers \) have all signed elsewhere , without the yankees' involvement but winning the winter means nothing teams crowned victorious in the offseason have generally collected players coming off performances they might not sustain their decline can lead to the disappointment felt last season by the red sox , the chicago white sox and the san diego padres people have talked to me a lot about well , the yankees are a team that usually makes a big splash , ' girardi said well , we 've been making a lot of big splashes the last five or six years you look at our position players , they are all on longterm contracts you look at our pitchers , they are on longterm contracts for us to go out and add big pieces , i did n't expect that to happen girardi has a point the yankees have few decisions now because they have already made them in past offseasons with seemingly little room to maneuver , they have added castro , hicks , gregorius and starter nathan eovaldi \( all 26 or younger \) in the last two offseasons , while promoting starter luis severino \( who turns 22 in february \) and first baseman greg bird \( 23 \) to the majors last august cashman said the yankees had not offered severino , bird or outfielder aaron judge in any potential deals , which means they have no chance to land the miami marlins' young ace , jose fernandez , in a trade none of the yankees' starters logged 170 innings last season , and their offense was dangerously dependent on alex rodriguez and mark teixeira they are probably not the favorites in the american league east but the yankees have a better chance with castro than they would have had with refsnyder or dustin ackley at second base they are also fulfilling their revised mission statement it is no longer simply to win period they must get younger while doing it now we 're hopefully doing what we say , cashman said , and meaning what we say
luis robles was just going to hang around for a couple of months stay in shape , cash his paychecks , wait for a team to claim him in all likelihood , nobody would and that was ok his wife would have the baby covered by major league soccer s health insurance and that would be it robles would walk away from soccer for good he was fine with that even had a job lined up instead , on sunday , robles will start in goal for the red bulls when they open the mls playoffs against dc united this is what he does , what robles has done 106 times in a row now six games shy of kevin hartman s league record of starting and finishing 112 straight regularseason games midfielder chris klein once started 118 in a row the overall league record for consecutive games although , unlike robles and hartman , he did not complete them all but that record is now within view for robles , too if it is strange for robles , 31 , to be nearing either milestone , it is because the odds of his becoming the league s ironman were prohibitively long he was a marginal and undersize prospect coming out of the university of portland , drafted 50th over all by dc united in 2007 when mls offered him an 11 , 700 developmental contract , he declined and decided to try his luck in germany instead his agent put him up in the barn of an old country house , where robles took up residence in the spartan washroom in fits of boredom , he would walk the sheep on the property , luring them around the grounds with cheerios but while he worked as an amateur shepherd , he also was becoming a professional goalkeeper almost two years after he dropped his bags in the barn , robles won the starting job with the senior team at fc kaiserslautern , in germany s second professional tier when his manager threatened to fine him 10 , 000 euros for not speaking german , robles began hanging out with his aging , chainsmoking landlady , who actually spoke the pfaelzisch dialect that was how the arizonaraised son of a south korean mother and a puerto rican father , who speaks neither korean nor spanish , came to be fluent in german it was his play that got him noticed robles briefly earned a spot on the united states national team in 2009 , spending the summer with the team at the concacaf gold cup that callup , his last one to date , forced him to miss kaiserslautern s preseason , however , and upon his return he found that the team s new manager had given his starting job to someone else after a season on the bench , robles moved on to karlsruher , which also played in germany s second division but the club had seven managers in his two seasons there , and robles soon found himself ostracized from the club and as a 6foot1 shotstopper in a country that preferred giants in goal criticized in the news media , which accused him of being a lockerroom cancer when you 're a foreign goalkeeper and maybe not a stereotypical build and then you have a tremendous amount of turnover , it does n't make for a good situation , said the former goalkeeper kasey keller , a veteran of german soccer and , as a former portland allamerican , something of a mentor to robles you can become a victim of circumstance exasperated , robles and his wife , cara , who was pregnant , decided in early 2012 that they wanted to go home we decided we were going to come back and take a chance and see if major league soccer worked out , robles said and if not , i 'd go do something else with my life but the league s dense tangle of rules and regulations on player acquisitions kept tripping up the teams that wanted to sign robles because he had played for the united states , even if it was , he was categorized as a returning national team player that meant any team that selected him would go to the back of the line when the next one became available , a steep price to pay for a presumed backup goalkeeper while he waited , robles fielded offers from norway , sweden and azerbaijan , but none of them made sense so in the absence of any kind of signal from mls , robles took a job with a real estate business back home in arizona with a baby on the way , he needed the security of the health insurance the job offered , and the brokerage promised him a new career we were in a situation where i thought if soccer is done , it s ok , robles said i was n't bitter i was n't resentful it was a hard way for it to end but maybe , at the end of the day , that was my career and i was ok with it it seemed like a natural transition , an opportunity to move on but robles s wife insisted he contact mls one last time she says , why do n't you just google major league soccer' and call them \? ' robles said i'm like you 're crazy it does n't work this way' she told me how it works was n't working either so robles called the league and someone picked up robles negotiated a cutrate deal for 44 , 000 , making sure to ask if it came with health insurance assured that it did , he signed the contract and waited for a team to claim him his plan was to hang around in soccer limbo long enough for the baby to arrive and then quit for good i figured if i can get through this and not pay 25 grand for a pregnancy , that in and of itself is worth it , robles said in august 2012 , the red bulls unexpectedly picked him up he had not practiced in months but made a strong impression , surprising both himself and his new team on sept 29 , 2012 , he started his first game he has not missed a minute of playing time since a run of more than 10 , 000 consecutive minutes , if playoffs are included having that experience , he tried to learn from it why he was presented with those challenges and how to grow , red bulls coach jesse marsch said it s empowered him to appreciate what he s going through now and helped get him there as well teammates contend that the genial and cerebral robles is still not fully appreciated the red bulls allowed the fewest goals in the eastern conference this season , a big reason they posted the league s best record and earned a bye in the first round of the playoffs yet only recently has robles been considered a serious contender to win the league s goalkeeper of the year award i do n't think he gets the credit that he deserves , said the red bulls' captain , dax mccarty i think the past three years , he should have been in the conversation for goalkeeper of the year every season , but for whatever reason , he has n't been he s kind of flown under the radar robles still wears no 31 , the one he was given when he arrived that was the number they gave me , he said when asked why he had never sought a lower number no one ever asked me other things have changed robles and his wife now have two children , ages 3 and 1 both pregnancies were covered by the health insurance that came with his professional resurrection but robles knows that his business is fickle , that a new manager could end his career a second time robles chuckles at the thought i could , he said , go back to real estate
new delhi the police in announced that they had killed six men suspected of tiger poaching during a shootout sunday in the sundarbans , a mangrove forest , in what they described as the beginning of a larger crackdown the raid comes amid heightened pressure to take action on poaching fewer than 2 , 500 bengal tigers are left in the wild , most of them in india , with smaller populations in , nepal , bhutan , china and myanmar , according to the world wildlife fund two weeks ago , forest officials in bangladesh announced a sharp drop in the tiger population in the sundarbans , a vast mangrove forest , from 440 in 2004 to just 106 today though some experts attributed the drop in part to a change in the counting methodology , which now uses hidden cameras instead of paw prints , many environmentalists called for steppedup measures against poaching tapan kumar dey , bangladesh s lead forest conservator , said he was quite happy that the police were taking a tough approach as a tiger activist , i appreciate this killing , he said in a telephone interview on monday local police officials said they got a tip about a tiger poaching ring and detained a member of the gang , who , under pressure , agreed to lead the authorities to a hideout in the mangrove forest as the authorities approached the hideout , the suspects opened fire , said mohammad habibur rahman , a senior police official in the ensuing shootout , he said , six men suspected of poaching and the associate who had led the police to the spot were all fatally wounded the police said several officers were injured in the gunfight none were killed mr rahman said the police seized three 10foot skins of mature tigers , which he said had been acquired recently and could be sold for 200 , 000 to 300 , 000 taka , or around 2 , 600 to 3 , 600 , as well as four foreignmanufactured firearms and ammunition of course , we suspect a big racket is involved in this trade , he said we are trying to unearth this racket he said the group of men were known to the police because they had carried out kidnappings for ransom and illegally smuggled valuable wood cut from the mangrove forest bangladesh s forest department has reported the killing of 49 tigers by poachers from 2001 to 2014 , 32 of them in the sundarbans area
so there s a lot of buzz about alleged scandals involving the clinton foundation maybe there s something to it but you have to wonder is this just the return of clinton rules \? if you are old enough to remember the 1990s , you remember the endless parade of alleged scandals , whitewater above all all of them fomented by rightwing operatives , all eagerly hyped by mainstream news outlets , none of which actually turned out to involve wrongdoing the usual rules didn t seem to apply instead it was clinton rules , under which innuendo and guilt by association were considered perfectly ok , in which the initial suggestion of lawbreaking received frontpage headlines and the subsequent discovery that there was nothing there was buried in the back pages if it was reported at all some of the same phenomenon resurfaced during the 2008 primary so , is this time different \? first indications are not encouraging it s already apparent that the author of the anticlinton book that s driving the latest stuff is a real piece of work  again , maybe there s something there but given the history here , we d all be well advised to follow our own clinton rules , and be highly suspicious of any reports of supposed scandals unless there s hard proof rather than mere innuendo oh , and the news media should probably be aware that this isn t 1994 there s a much more effective progressive infrastructure now , much more scrutiny of reporting , and the kinds of malpractice that went unsanctioned 20 years ago can land you in big trouble now

at the end of each baseball season , ned yost goes home to his 700acre spread in georgia , where he can close the gate behind him , settle into his blind and hunt it is his sanctuary , a place where he is at peace , jettisoning the scrutiny and sleepless nights that accompany him during the season yost expected it to be the same last winter , after the team he manages , the , came agonizingly close to winning the world series , the seventh game ending when catcher salvador perez fouled out with the tying run at third base one day turned into one week , then one month , but the sting did not abate when yost returned to arizona for spring training , the disappointment still felt like a kick in the gut for his players , it served as a spur we think about it quite often , royals first baseman eric hosmer said i 've said before , and i 'll say it again i think that s kind of something that we all turn to mentally , to kind of when there s points in time during the season where your team is not going too well you look in september there , and we started to slide a little bit but i just think everyone kind of relates back to that and relates to how much that hurt the royals knew the only way to salve their regret was to win the world series , and sunday night at citi field , they accomplished that in a very royallike manner , with a comefrombehind 72 victory in 12 innings over the the victory , their fourth in five games , gave them their first championship since 1985 the royals survived a superb performance by the mets' matt harvey , scoring twice in the ninth inning to tie the score at 22 and breaking through to score five times in the 12th against relievers addison reed and bartolo colon for a team that has been defined by its derringdo on the basepaths , it was fitting that the game turned on the bold base running of hosmer , who dashed home with the tying run in the ninth on an infield groundout when mets first baseman lucas duda s throw home went wide of the mark the winning rally also had innocuous roots a bloop single by perez , a stolen base by pinchrunner jarrod dyson , a productive groundout by alex gordon that moved dyson to third and a line single to left by pinchhitter christian colon , who was making his first appearance in the postseason then the floodgates opened doubles by alcides escobar and lorenzo cain brought home four runs , sending fans toward the exits and leaving the royals to await the coronation that came when wade davis struck out wilmer flores for the final out , sending the royals storming out of the dugout it s unbelievable , said perez , the winner of the series most valuable player award , who was one of four homegrown starters on sunday night we 've got almost the same group when i played my first year in 2007 in arizona , the rookie league it s amazing to now win a world series and see the same guys with you it was the royals' eighth comefrombehind win in the playoffs , including all four in this series , which began with gordon s ninthinning , gametying home run off mets closer jeurys familia that led to a 14inning victory in game 1 on sunday , the royals were held scoreless against harvey until the ninth but after cain walked to begin the inning and stole second base , hosmer doubled into the leftfield corner to cut the mets' lead to 21 , and familia , the closer , relieved harvey mike moustakas moved hosmer to third with a groundout , and perez grounded to third baseman david wright to begin the critical sequence wright , who ranged to his left to snag the ball , froze hosmer by looking back , and then threw to duda at first base as he did , hosmer broke for the plate , but duda s throw which would have been in time to get the final out sailed wide of catcher travis d'arnaud i just kept shuffling along with david , hosmer said as soon as his head turned to go to first base , it s an opportunity for us to maybe steal a run the decision was not a rash one in their scouting reports , the royals identified wright and duda as suspect fielders watching wright throw , he does n't have a cannon plus duda over there , he s got to catch the ball and still make a perfect throw to home , which he did n't do , the thirdbase coach mike jirschele said we talk about that it was the type of aggressive base running that has put the royals' opponents on their heels all through the playoffs hosmer s hustle forced daniel murphy s crushing error in game 4 cain scored the pennantwinning run against the toronto blue jays by racing home from first base on a single and the royals stayed alive in their division series against houston when astros shortstop carlos correa hastily misplayed a potential doubleplay grounder until hosmer s dash , harvey had owned the night from the moment he stepped to the mound and struck out escobar , the royals' pesky leadoff hitter the capacity crowd rose to its feet frequently , waving orange towels and letting chants of harvey , harvey echo throughout the stadium harvey carried the crowd s energy and rode it like a wave through the middle innings when he struck out the heart of the royals' order cain , hosmer and moustakas in the fourth , the last pitch a 98mileanhour fastball , he shook his fist and let out a scream he struck out three more in the fifth , though he did allow a walk harvey masterfully used all four of his pitches fastball , curveball , slider and changeup keeping the readytohit royals off balance and out of sorts most important , he did so efficiently , keeping his pitch count manageable enough so that he could forcefully plead with manager terry collins , who was criticized for his use of the bullpen in saturday night s loss , to finish on sunday in case collins needed any additional prodding , fans who watched the conversation take place took up harvey s case by chanting his name when he hopped up the dugout steps and sprinted to the mound to begin the ninth , the stadium roared once again it was a decision collins came to regret i let my heart get in the way of my gut , collins said i love my players and i trust them and so i said , go get 'em' and he went out , and the leadoff walk started it off he added it did n't work it was my fault for the last two months , harvey has brought to the mound something beside his gifted right arm and his comicbook nickname he carried with him an anvillike question , one that cuts to the heart of any competitor especially one whose persona , the dark knight , has been crafted around relishing the biggest stage was he all in \? when his agent , scott boras , raised concerns in early september that the mets were compromising harvey s longterm prospects , it put harvey who missed last season after elbow surgery in the uncomfortable public position of having to weigh in on two agendas that did not necessarily dovetail his longterm future and the mets' current prospects then , early in the playoffs , harvey was late for a workout , arriving blearyeyed and saying he had overslept when he left on sunday , to a standing ovation after 111 pitches , there was little questioning that harvey had given his best and his all if harvey s performance was redemptive , royals starting pitcher edinson volquez s was inspirational volquez , who started the series opener , learned after he left that game on tuesday that his father , daniel , had died earlier in the day from heart failure volquez returned to the dominican republic for his father s funeral , then rejoined his teammates in new york just before the start of game 4 volquez was nearly harvey s equal , allowing only curtis granderson s leadoff home run in the first inning and then limited the mets to one run when they loaded the bases with none out in the sixth the mets not only lost an opportunity to broaden their cushion , they also lost center fielder yoenis cespedes , who fouled a ball off his knee and left after popping out on their path to the world series , the mets could do no wrong , it seemed but here it was the royals , who pestered the mets' pitchers by making contact , flustered their fielders with their aggression and shackled their hitters at the plate they also had a manager who pushed all the right buttons as mets general manager sandy alderson walked past his team s clubhouse , holding his dog on a leash , he noted that only one team could win not far away , his manager was feeling the disappointment of it all coming so far and coming up short i wo n't be sleeping much the next couple of days , collins said i 'll tell you that somewhere on the other side of the field , soaked in champagne and celebrating , there was a manager and many royals players who know just what he means
islamabad , pakistan sent 30 migrants back to three european countries on thursday after refusing to allow them to disembark from a chartered plane at an airport in islamabad , officials said , a move that reflected growing frustration over the treatment of asylum seekers sarfraz hussain , a spokesman for the pakistani interior ministry , described the migrants as unverified deportees , most of whom were sent back from greece , saying the authorities would not permit anyone to enter the country without proper documentation a greek police official , speaking on the customary condition of anonymity , said all 49 passengers on the plane were pakistani citizens they had pakistani embassy documents , he said why would pakistani embassy staff give documents to people who are not from \? the pakistani interior minister , chaudhry nisar ali khan , said last month that european countries were sending people back to pakistan without identifying their nationality but the episode thursday was the first time that the country had refused to admit deportees in a statement , the said on thursday that pakistan was requiring identification information about the deportees above and beyond what was called for in a readmission agreement reached in 2010 , and that the case illustrated the need to improve the accord officials said none of the passengers , who were flown to benazir bhutto international airport , were initially allowed to leave the plane the passengers were questioned , and the authorities then allowed 19 people to disembark after they were confirmed to be pakistani citizens they were taken into custody by a unit of the interior ministry that deals with human trafficking greece is the most popular entry point for asylum seekers in europe , and on thursday , its migration minister said the country would take steps to address the deteriorating situation along the border with macedonia pakistanis have been among the huge flow of asylum seekers into europe this year , but unlike those from afghanistan , iraq and syria , who are fleeing war at home , pakistanis are rarely allowed to remain because they are viewed as economic migrants the greek police official said action will be taken when the migrants returned to greece , but he did not elaborate , noting that the flight was organized by frontex , the s border monitoring agency he said 39 had been deported from greece and the other 10 from austria and bulgaria of the 30 who were not allowed to enter pakistan , 26 had been deported from greece pakistan tightened its policy on readmitting migrants last month , and mr khan said an agreement to take migrants back in was the subject of blatant misuse by several european countries yiannis mouzalas , the greek migration minister , said it was the responsibility of the european union to intervene mr khan said many of the 90 , 000 citizens of pakistan who were deported last year had been treated unfairly , and he expressed concern that many from his country who were found traveling without proper documents were being labeled terrorists after a meeting on nov 23 between mr khan and dimitris avramopoulos , the european union commissioner for migration , both sides agreed to enhance cooperation on thursday , however , mr hussain said greece had violated the agreement , complaining of immoral , inhuman and illegal conduct in greece , mr mouzalas said the authorities were determined to resolve peacefully the situation at the border with macedonia in the next 10 days the international organization for migration said that the borders had been closed because of protests and rioting , and that a 22yearold moroccan citizen had died after being electrocuted the police and local aid workers said he was killed after he touched a highvoltage cable when he climbed on top of a stationary train near the border

s o paulo , brazil less than a year after its from the world cup , brazilian soccer has a new crisis on its hands s professional teams are drowning in debt , hemorrhaging players and playing in nearempty stadiums eight of the top 12 clubs are behind on salaries if they were businesses , nearly every team in the first division , serie a , would be bankrupt now , with brazil s economy in recession , and sponsors and fans cutting back on spending , the clubs' finances are expected to get even worse the clubs must publish their 2014 results by april 30 , and only one rio de janeiro s flamengo will be able to announce that it has earned enough to service its debt and pay its taxes , according to estimations by cesar grafietti , a credit manager at the brazilian investment bank ita bba the consequences are increasingly visible on the field brazil s clubs make much of their money by selling their players almost none of whom are free agents to foreign clubs , but the export of brazilian soccer talent is accelerating and instead of sending stars like neymar to top european clubs like barcelona for tens of millions of dollars , brazilian clubs are selling their best players to teams in countries out of the global soccer spotlight cruzeiro , a club from belo horizonte that was the league champion in 2013 and 2014 , this year sold two top young players , verton ribeiro and ricardo goulart , to teams in the united arab emirates and china ribeiro and goulart are considered to be strong candidates to play on brazil s national team in the 2018 world cup , though playing in secondtier leagues may hurt their chances teams desperate for cash are selling everyounger players , even teenagers who have not yet established themselves and can command only modest transfer fees the clubs are selling their futures , said amir somoggi , a sports management consultant in s o paulo somoggi estimated that brazilian clubs would sell more than 1 , 200 players to foreign teams this year fans used to be able to see top talents play for at least a few years here before they got sent abroad , grafietti said now the best players are going immediately , and the quality of the spectacle is suffering the clubs' troubles are rooted in years of reckless management all of the firstdivision clubs are structured as nonprofit organizations that in theory exist to serve their fans qualified fans usually those who pay a modest membership fee vote to choose the clubs' top management , which does not receive salaries fans usually do not elect those who promise longterm success , but those who promise a championship immediately , no matter the cost s o paulo s corinthians , for example , in 2013 paid a 15 million euro transfer fee \( about 161 million \) to bring striker alexandre pato back from the italian club ac milan corinthians kept pato for only a year before sending him on loan to its city rival s o paulo fc to stay afloat , many clubs are resorting to bank loans at interest rates that often exceed 30 percent a year , and to blatant tax evasion as nonprofits , the clubs do not pay corporate income tax , but they withhold income tax from their players' salaries and are supposed to pay social security contributions many do not , however , and spend the money deducted from players' paychecks instead as a result , the government has become the clubs' biggest creditor , with about four billion reais \( 13 billion \) in unpaid taxes in an attempt to save the country s national sport and send some money into federal coffers , president dilma rousseff last month that would waive most penalties for late payments and would give the clubs up to 20 years to pay their back taxes three times in the past 15 years , the government has given the clubs similar refinancing deals this time will be different , government officials say , because the proposed legislation demands that the clubs put their houses in order the proposed bill would forbid clubs from spending more than 70 percent of revenue on salaries , require them to pay all taxes and salaries on time , and demand that they break even financially no later than 2021 the bill would also require the clubs to invest in player development and women s soccer somoggi estimated that , for the clubs to meet these requirements , they would have to cut spending on salaries by 30 percent on average to enforce the new requirements , the legislation would make management personally liable for missteps and would relegate noncompliant clubs out of the first division the response of many clubs to the proposed changes has been outrage the bill creates penal aspects that are entirely inappropriate , said l zaro cunha , director of legal affairs for the belo horizonte club atl tico mineiro if it passes , there will be a rebellion among the clubs cunha said he agreed that the clubs must improve management and fiscal responsibility , but that the new bill was uncalledfor and unprecedented government interference in the business of private entities atl tico mineiro and other clubs are working to persuade congress to change the bill , but eduardo bandeira de mello , the president of flamengo , brazil s most popular club , said he supported it it is severe but necessary , he said de mello , a longtime executive in brazil s national development bank before he took the reins of flamengo in 2013 , spent his first years at the club cutting costs to balance the books we sent v gner love , our best player , abroad and we made no big hires for two years , he said it hurt our performance with his club s finances now relatively solid , de mello said he was eager for the bill to pass so other teams would have to play by the same rules whether the current bill survives the lobbying effort against it , few dispute that brazilian soccer must change the national team s humiliating defeat to germany in last year s world cup semifinals , a national embarrassment that highlighted the weakened state of the country s domestic game , convinced many brazilians that their league needed major structural reform that 71 loss was a wakeup call , said juca kfouri , a leading brazilian soccer journalist there s support among players and in society for change
flaming june by frederic leighton \( 18301896 \) , a famous victorian painting , has come to new york for the first time in more than 35 years , for a solo turn at the  anyone who s ever perused books of late19thcentury british art will instantly recognize the idyllic image of a young woman in a sheer , incandescent orange dress curled up in sleep on piles of drapery on a marble bench , with a sunstruck mediterranean in the distance she s particularly memorable for her disproportionately long and muscular right thigh tightly wrapped in diaphanous fabric , it extends from buttock to bended knee across the lower middle of the picture , practically dwarfing the upper part of her body leighton based her pose on michelangelo s sculpture night and on a copy of his lost painting both of which feature similarly bent legs with powerful thighs measuring just under 4 feet by 4 feet , flaming june , circa 1895 , appears within a brightly goldleafed , that imitates the ionic architecture of ancient grecoroman temples it invites viewers into a hallucinatory space of pagan mystery at the frick , the whole assemblage hangs between dark , wooden , ionic pilasters in the museum s oval room in the company of james mcneill whistler s tall portraits of three fashionable women and a man , all brushily rendered in muted colors \( they are permanent frick fixtures \) , flaming june glows it looks as if she was always meant to be here \( why it s called flaming june , no one knows \) it s not one of the world s greatest works of art this is n't anything like vermeer s leighton s subject has none of the magical vitality of vermeer s painted with academic virtuosity in viscous glazes , she seems as if immersed in jello but as an artifact of victorian consciousness , leighton s painting is exceptionally interesting organized by , the frick s senior curator , includes one other piece a lovely , 4inchby4inch painted study for the final work pablo p rez d'ors , associate curator of european art at the , in ponce , pr , the painting s permanent residence , notes in his catalog essay that the beautiful woman asleep in some archaic past was a recurrent motif in victorian art he speculatively connects that with fantasies about opium dens popularized in stories by arthur conan doyle , among others , which paved the way for the appearance of symbolic allusions to the unconscious and to death along these lines , he points out that the red flowers in the scene s upperright corner are oleanders , which were known to be poisonous this makes the woman a femme fatale , a dangerously alluring figure who would seduce the unwary into oblivion because she s asleep and possibly dreaming , and because the image itself is like a dream , it s hard to resist some psychoanalysis , the method that freud was inventing around the same time that leighton was working on his picture , the last and most famous of his career two elements are conspicuous the weirdly oversized , unmistakably phallic thigh and the fluttering drapery all around the figure , which makes her appear to be enfolded in a field of energy , as ms galassi puts it in her catalog essay what else can this be , a freudian might rhetorically ask , but an image of what the french call la petite mort \? but the broader context of european history and its accelerating second industrial revolution is worth considering , too the figure of the languid woman is more than just an object of erotic desire she s the opposite of the rationalist , everstriving , murderously competitive spirit once conventionally thought of as distinctively masculine she embodies a yearning to relax , to retire from the fray and take pleasure in just being alive as a shapeshifting archetype , she turns up repeatedly in modernist art in paintings by picasso , matisse , modigliani , and countless other , usually male , artists she s the countercultural soul of modernity himself was no rebel born into a wealthy family and trained in frankfurt , paris and rome , he was for many years president of the royal academy but the 20th century was n't kind to his memory until the 1970s , victorian art in general was regarded by sophisticates as stale , morally stultifying , formulaic kitsch then the tide turned with their complex narratives , poetic metaphors , references to times past , the victorians appealed to a postmodernist sensibility that new enthusiasm precipitated an avalanche of art books in which flaming june was frequently reproduced now it belongs as much popular as to high culture you can even buy earrings and pendants featuring miniature reproductions of the picture that the painting is so widely known today is owed mainly to luis a ferr , who , in 1965 , founded the how mr ferr acquired it is a tale of luck and passion from 1915 to 1928 , the painting was exhibited at the , after which it disappeared then in 1962 it was discovered hidden behind a false panel in a house in london the following year mr ferr spotted leighton s siren in a london gallery and , as he put it , fell in love with her at first sight he bought it for about 8 , 000 , factoring in inflation the original frame was lost , but it turned out that the molds used to make it still existed at the firm created a new frame just like the old one in 1994 , and flaming june , called in its day the most wonderful painting in existence by the collector , was finally restored to its former glory
hornu , belgium after the british designer jasper morrison had presented his products a few years ago to a prospective client , a chinese electronics company , he was shown one of its current best sellers , a cellphone with fake diamonds sparkling on a plastic case with a pearl finish well , why did you come to me then \? he asked a glance at thingness , a retrospective of mr morrison s 30year career , at le grand hornu , a cultural center in a beautifully restored , early 19thcentury mining complex originally designed by the neoclassical architect bruno renard , explains his incredulity far from sparkly , the exhibits , which include furniture , cookware , toys , watches , shoes and lights , are unfailingly subtle and utilitarian in style mr morrison , 55 , is one of the most influential product designers of our time he has articulated his design philosophy in exhibitions before , albeit in smaller shows , many of them featuring pieces by other designers or anonymously designed objects that interest him thingness , which runs through sept 13 and is to open at the museum of design in zurich in february , is the most comprehensive survey of his own work so far together with a new book he has written about his work , a book of things , the show provides intriguing insights into his evolution as a designer it is hard to overstate how radical mr morrison s deliberately unobtrusive design language must have seemed in 1986 , when he opened a studio in london , after studying there and in berlin at the time , design was dominated by the flamboyant , richly symbolic work of the postmodernists , who sought to liberate it from what they saw as the soullessness of mid20th century modernism , which mr morrison admired for its economy , efficiency and restraint one of the earliest pieces in thingness reads as a statement of intent for his career some new items for the home is a room set mr morrison designed in 1988 for an exhibition in berlin using bare plywood for the walls , floor and furniture , all of which are austere in structure and style the frugal aesthetic was both an antipostmodernist gesture and a practical solution to the technical challenge of having to make the work himself the choice of plywood , then considered unfashionably dowdy , alluded to its use in the 1930s furniture of the modernist pioneer marcel breuer \( mr morrison had read up on design history in the secondhand design books he sold at antiques markets as a student \) pinned to the wall of the room is a map of the world devised by another of his heroes , the visionary american designer r buckminster fuller some new items attracted the attention of vitra , the swiss furniture maker with whom mr morrison has worked ever since one of his strengths has been the deftness with which he has forged longterm relationships with supportive clients , like vitra , the japanese retail group muji , the italian lighting manufacturer flos , the swiss electronics company punkt and the tate modern museum in london he has proved adroit at extricating himself from lessproductive situations having discovered that he disliked the political aspects of large public sector projects , for example , he has since avoided them mr morrison , who has studios in london , paris and tokyo , has thus avoided the freelance designer s traps of struggling to adjust to yet another company s way of working and being expected to repeat past successes , and has been able to produce an unusually coherent , yet steadily evolving body of work mr morrison has also been free to develop his thinking in his writing and curatorial projects the design qualities he prizes are evident in the recurring words in the texts in thingness and in his new book comfort , character , functional , efficient , economical , practical and nononsense anything overcomplicated , uncomfortable or egocentric irks him , especially when such traits compromise efficiency he is equally irritated when new objects are designed to replace old ones without good reason , in part because he often finds inspiration in forgotten or neglected objects among the earliest pieces in thingness , which mr morrison chose to curate himself after the museum invited him to exhibit there , is a 1990 door knob shaped like an oldfashioned light bulb other items include a wooden chair completed last year and inspired by parisian caf chairs and a corkscrew he designed to work like one he had used for 20 years but that was no longer in production mr morrison has also used thingness to show how his books and exhibitions have influenced his design work a highlight of the retrospective is a world without words , a slide show he compiled in 1988 from images of a fire hydrant , soccer stadium and other things whose design had appealed to him in the vintage books he sold during his studies mr morrison applied similar principles to super normal , an exhibition he cocurated with the japanese designer naoto fukasawa in 2006 that celebrated the quiet virtues of thoughtfully designed , unobtrusively styled objects , including the bic pen , bialetti espresso maker and furniture in simple shapes and subdued colors such projects have reinforced mr morrison s impact on design by articulating his position , and fostering debate super normal is often cited in the current discourse on design s role in gender politics because its aesthetic is so neutral that people can project the nuances of their gender identities onto it the hornu retrospective is characteristically straightforward in concept and execution objects and prototypes are displayed in chronological order on wooden shelves , interspersed with photographs of other projects and mr morrison s texts , including essays on design issues and descriptions of the design process i enjoy a wellcurated exhibition as much as anyone , mr morrison said but in the case of a single designer s retrospective , i think it is preferable \( while the designer is still standing \) to selfcurate to ensure a homogenous experience the risk of adopting a nononsense approach to design is that the outcome may seem so familiar that it is boring the rigor and sensitivity of the objects in thingness illustrate how a gifted designer can avoid that mr morrison s bestselling globall , an opalescent glass light manufactured by flos , has been copied repeatedly , but none of the imitations match its refinement neither thingness nor the new book ignore the vicissitudes of product design a seemingly simple canvas bag took five years to develop , and mr morrison does not hide his frustration with promising projects being axed or with wasting time talking to a company that really wanted sparkly cellphones yet they also show how rewarding a designer s work can be thingness
i know of no regular event that more effectively , more movingly , recommends this country s diverse inclusiveness than the annual san francisco festival of ethnic dance the companies appearing are n't visitors from other countries they 're american but they perform the dances of other lands in most cases , dances they are preserving as their racial or national heritage and with exuberant pride each year , the festival presents a different program on each of four consecutive weekends if i lived in or near california , i would attend all four , every year \( the auditions alone are celebrated \) each year s presentations contain surprises last weekend , when i attended on the second weekend and watched two of the three performances , it was transporting just to witness the curtain calls group by group , the performers , all belonging to bay area dance companies , returned to the stage , representing dances from the philippines , spain , mexico , india , peru , korea , uzbekistan , west africa \( guinea , liberia , senegal \) the rush of color and exuberance was exhilarating but what made this glorious was that america in general , and the bay area in particular , has for these people and their dances , been a haven finally , as african drums pulsated , the nationalities merged in a happy eruption of rhythm there , together , were two women who had been the most spellbinding of the program s soloists , tara catherine pandeya \( a specialist in the dances of central asia , here performing the bukhara classical dance of uzbekistan \) and \( an israeli practitioner of flamenco , showing its expression of the suffering of the sephardic jews \) merrily , side by side , they executed gorgeous , offbalance renvers turns as the dancers left the stage , hyuckjoon cheong , lead male dancer of the ongdance company \( specializing in korean forms \) , in his broadbrimmed black chimney hat and his long coat with its trailing pale blue sleeves , was conversing intensely with one of the philippine men , dressed in loincloth and a gorgeous headdress one of these eight dances was nothing less than electrifying her two male colleagues and akhror rakhmatov had already supplied musical brilliance on the doira \( related to a tambourine \) mr kosimov at one point playing three at once \( even juggling one of them \) when ms pandeya , dressed in scarlet and black , arrived , she at once matched them her hands flitted like butterflies in the air around her head with bewildering speed and her feet \( in light black slippers \) drilled into the floor parts of this bukhara dance look related to the kathak genre of india similar rapid single turns , similar percussive rhythmic play of the footwork but the trilling sparkle of ms pandeya s hands was like nothing i have seen in indian dance she also executed extraordinary backbends at one point , kneeling , she arched right back , her head brushing the floor , then , in that position , reached out to mr kosimov s doira and played that with her hands compelling in an entirely different way was kyoungil ong of ongdance a bay area specialist of korean forms whose large , wideeyed face registered shiningly through the theater her gown combined a voluminous shockingpink skirt with a primroseyellow but longsleeved bodice and much play was made of a skyblue cloak her dances were tenderly elegant , with her arms making vast arcs , and with soft footwork taking her across the floor as if gliding a very charming central dance showed her being courted by mr cheong , whose large fan sometimes protected her and sometimes screened her the various ways he drew her into his embrace were enchanting this episode was followed by a drumming solo by seungik lee , who , keeping his head in constant motion , made the sixfoot ribbon from his headdress dance in spirals behind his back the finale to this number was a seven drum dance in which ms ong and ms cheong were accompanists to five female dancerdrummers drums were arranged like alcoves around each of these women , who sometimes arched back and drummed furiously on both the drums behind them and ahead of them , and sometimes rotated while drumming this year s festival other programs will occur in the next two weekends takes place in the palace of fine arts theater , one of san francisco s landmarks , and perfect in history and location for this event this is the building s centenary it was built as part of the panamapacific international exposition among other things , that exposition popularized the ukulele on the american mainland so , of course , this program began with the playing of a ukulele \( stage right \) and a hawaiian hula dancer \( stage left \) most dances were triumphs of color most of the men of had black and red plumes cascading from their heads the women of the local wore full yellow dresses and swirled blue shawls and for sheer brightness nothing equaled the glittering fabrics of the bay area s bollywood ensemble the program was also rich in percussion , none more polyrhythmically intense than that of the , whose male and female dancers were exhilaratingly in numbers from guinea , liberia and senegal it s often said that west african dances are initiated by the pelvis , but here it was the exuberance of arms , thighs and feet that astounded i was puzzled that the women of the peruvian group of northern california , , performed barefoot while the men were in heeled shoes , but i was entirely happy while watching and listening the feet of both sexes proved richly expressive and vivacious the women held out their large dresses like fans and the men flourished their sombreros in their hands wonderfully , the men also fluttered handkerchiefs indicating in the air the feelings of their hearts
in 1915 , 50 years after appomattox , the london branch of civil war veterans counted 115 members the list can be found in harvard s houghton library , and it provides the names , addresses , ages and length and general location of the service of all its members one man , listed only as e munro , was reported as being 105 years old presumably , there were many other veterans who made their way to britain after the war , who had either died by 1915 or had never bothered to join the branch two years later , when the first american soldiers on their way to france were arriving in britain , they were met with a parade several civil war veterans joined the procession michael hammerson , of the american civil war round table uk , writes that one soldier , writing home to his mother , related that he was in one of the first regiments to pass in front of the king and queen , and that their escorts were united states civil war veterans the proximity of those two generations in that moment is striking did they speak to each other \? if so , what did they say \? in popular memory , two generations are normally seen as worlds apart generals ulysses s grant and john pershing could not have been more different in their demeanor and world views , and yet there they were , represented , marching side by side the purpose of the branch was straightforward enough as the minutes of a meeting in sept 20 , 1910 , relate , it existed to promote fraternizing , fellowship , camp fire tales , lower deck yarns , jabbering and singing those long ago battle hymns thanking god for sparing mercies our beautiful brass band playing sherman s march , star spangled banner , we are coming , father abram , and 300 , 000 more , while we all stand up and the chaplain thanks god we are yet alive as steve tuffnell , a postdoctoral student in history at oxford , pointed out , the veterans reappeared a year later , during a celebration on july 4 , 1918 the event , held at the central hall in westminster , featured winston churchill , then the minister of munitions , and a large contingent of american civil war veterans , according to the times of london churchill spoke of the relation between magna carta and the declaration of independence , and how , because of that , we therefore feel no sense of division in celebrating this anniversary we join in perfect sincerity and in perfect simplicity with our american kith and kin in commemorating the auspicious and glorious establishment of their nationhood much of what we know about the london veterans is thanks to the organization s head , john davis , a scrupulous notetaker and selfpromoter in one of the group s publications , david celebrated the london veterans in verse tis true in dwindling numbers each succeeding year , more grey , more bent , more tottering , as each others hearts we cheer alongside the poem he printed a photograph of abraham lincoln , and beside it davis himself , with a large white beard in another image , he holds the wheel of a ship that has inscribed on it all the storms will soon be over nearing the harbour of heaven and home and in a third photo , he is shaking the hand of a fellow veteran , monroe , on monroe s 105th birthday tracking down the other members is a bit harder with a little research and luck , a few names become faces maurice wagg was born in new hampshire , was still married to his first wife when he married his second , served in the navy on the rhode island and apparently saved individuals off the monitor when it sank on dec 30 , 1862 others linger just beyond in the temporary dark one member was named william askew , but there are a frustrating number of men with that name in the national archives and it seems odd that there s little evidence of a man as uniquely named as r schroobree but there is one mystery that seems , for now , unlikely to be solved in one photograph , one member of the london branch of us civil war veterans appears to be a sikh none of the surnames that appear on the membership list appear to be sikh turnell said there s a window of possibility that the sikh from the photo joined later or even only signed up for the march in 1917 there s the additional layer that he may have anglicized his name on arrival in the us or even while in britain , so he could be hidden in plain sight as it were at least 50 south asians fought in the civil war , as the historians francis assisi and elizabeth pothen have noted , typically with anglicized names like john burns , henry bell and peter blake eventually , the notes from davis trail off in the archives , and presumably the london branch shrank as its membership died , though there is no record of when its last member passed away but even if the group s history is shrouded , it deserves to be remembered , if only as a marker for how long , and how far afield , the legacy of the civil war spread follow disunion at or join us  evan fleischer is a writer in new york city follow the new york times opinion section on and , and sign up for the
beyond all the talk of centrifuges and enrichment capacities , president obama s deal with iran is really a giant gamble on the nature of the iranian regime the core question is are the men who control that country more like lenin or are they more like gorbachev \? do they still fervently believe in their revolution and would they use their postsanctions wealth to export it and destabilize their region \? or have they lost faith in their revolution \? will they use a deal as a way to rejoin the community of nations \? we got a big piece of evidence on those questions on thursday iran s supreme leader , ayatollah ali khamenei , to the sortofagreedupon nuclear framework what did we learn \? first , we learned that iran s supreme leader still regards the united states as his enemy the audience chanted death to america during his speech , and khamenei himself dismissed america s devilish intentions when a radical religious leader uses a word like devilish , he s not using it the way it s used in a chocolatecake commercial he means he thinks the united states is the embodiment of evil second , we learned that the west wants a deal more than khamenei does i was never optimistic about negotiating with america , he declared throughout the speech , his words dripped with a lack of enthusiasm for the whole enterprise president obama is campaigning for a deal , while khamenei is unmoved that imbalance explains why western negotiators had to give away so many of their original demands the united states had originally insisted upon an end to iran s nuclear program , a suspension of its enrichment of uranium , but that was conceded to keep iran at the table third , we learned that the ayatollah is demanding total trust from us while offering maximum contempt in return khamenei communicated a smug and selfrighteous sense of superiority toward the west throughout his remarks he haughtily repeated his demand that the west permanently end all sanctions on the very day the deal is signed he insisted that no inspectors could visit iranian military facilities this would make a hash of verification and enforcement fourth , we learned that khamenei and the us see different realities it s been pointed out that iranian and american officials describe the agreed upon framework in different ways that s because , khamenei suggested , the americans are lying i'm really worried as the other side is into lying and breaching promises an example was the white house fact sheet , he said this came out a few hours after the negotiations , and most of it was against the agreement and was wrong they are always trying to deceive and break promises fifth , khamenei reminded us that , even at the most delicate moment in these talks , he is still intent on putting iran on a collision course with sunnis and the west he attacked the saudi leaders as inexperienced youngsters and criticized efforts to push back on iranian efforts to destabilize yemen the foreign minister of the united arab emirates , sheikh abdullah bin zayed alnahyan , characterized iran s recent bellicosity this way it s about iran believing in exporting the revolution it s part of their regime , a part of their ideology khamenei s remarks could be bluster , tactical positioning for some domestic or international audience but they are entirely consistent with recent iranian behavior his speech suggests that iran still fundamentally sees itself in a holy war with the west , a war that can be managed prudently but that is still a fundamental clash of values and interests his speech suggests , in a brilliant oped essay in the wall street journal on wednesday , that there is no congruence of interests between us and iran we envision a region of stable nationstates they see a revolutionary antiwestern order if iran still has revolutionary intent , then no amount of treaty subtlety will enforce this deal iran will begin subtly subverting any agreement it will continue to work on its advanced nuclear technology even during the agreement it will inevitably use nuclear weaponry , or even the threat of eventual nuclear weaponry , to advance its apocalyptic interests every other regional power will prepare for the worst , and we 'll get a pseudonucleararms race in a region of disintegrating nationstates if president obama is right and iran is on the verge of change , the deal is a home run but we have a terrible record of predicting trends in the middle east republican and democratic administrations have continually anticipated turning points in the middle east republicans after interventions , democrats after negotiations but the dawns never come at some point , there has to be a scintilla of evidence that iran wants to change khamenei s speech offers none negotiating an arms treaty with brezhnev and gorbachev was one thing but with this guy \? good luck with that
twentytwo and sailors were injured at a military base in the southern california desert on thursday when a fireextinguisher system went off during a training exercise , the military said the accident happened inside an amphibious assault vehicle at the marine corps air ground combat center in twentynine palms , east of los angeles , the marine corps said some of the marines and sailors were taken to a hospital to be treated for inhaling the fire retardant , and they were in stable condition , according to the marine corps none of the injuries were lifethreatening , capt maureen t krebs , a marine corps spokeswoman , said the vehicle , which resembles a tank , is used to move troops from ships to land
when made its debut on comedy central in 2012 , it involved a lot of yelling the show s signature anger translator sketches were predicated on the contrast between the buttondown cool of jordan peele s barack obama and the volcanic squawks and wails of keeganmichael key s luther , the man hired to express the president s hidden emotions mr key also got to pump up the volume as mr garvey , the volatile substitute teacher bedeviled by his white suburban students two of the show s most vivid characters , the mean girl meegan \( mr peele \) and her boyfriend , andre \( mr key \) , spent their time shouting at each other outside clubs now in its fifth season , which will have its premiere on wednesday night , has experienced a shift in tone and volume there are still sketches built around escalating violence and invective , like wednesday s opener , a football lockerroom scene in which two players pound each other mercilessly while hollering clich s about teamwork but overall , the show feels quieter , more reflective and , if anything , even more cerebral than before when luther the anger translator does make an appearance , he s relatively subdued , taken aback at being outangered by hillary rodham clinton s translator , savannah \( brilliantly played by stephnie weir of the comedians \) well , you know how it is to campaign for president , clinton \( kate burton , who played the vice president on scandal \) says to obama , after which savannah snarls , right now you are the dead skunk i 've got to step over the contemplative mood is abetted by a significant change in the show s format that began last season interstitial segments that had mr key and mr peele talking to a live audience have been replaced by short scenes of them joking around as they take what appears to be a neverending drive through the desert these casual exchanges , sometimes almost surreal in their inconsequentiality , set up the subsequent sketches in loopy , indirect ways mr peele s passengerseat riff on being ashamed that he s half white leads into a sketch about wanting to infiltrate that whitest of institutions , the a cappella group changing the show s connective tissue from staged banter to something more cinematic makes sense , because one of the hallmarks of key peele has always been its craftsmanship , the care with which it s assembled and executed the sketches are often straightforward dueling anger translators , a white cop shooting black men that are holding anything at all in their hands , a conversation that disintegrates because every topic contains spoilers but they never feel simple or routine , partly because of the wit and subtlety of the writing but also because of the attention paid to costume and production design , the panache of peter atencio s directing \( he s done almost every episode \) and the performing skills of mr key and mr peele , which exceed those of the usual standup comedian none of this means the show has moved away from topicality or hotbutton issues , but here , too , there s sometimes a more oblique approach one short , hilarious sketch in the new episodes , featuring mr key as a stereotypical jovial black gent who stops to do a coin trick for a young white boy , makes a cogent statement about race relations with just a few lines of dialogue and some hundreddollar bills \( it s reminiscent of the brilliant and much more elaborate sketch , released by mr key and mr peele as a youtube video in may , in which a depressingly realistic encounter between a white cop and a black man out for a walk metamorphoses into a disneystyle musical about a paradisiacal africanamerican town , turning song of the south on its head \) the best in this regard is a new meegan and andre sketch , considerably quieter than its predecessors , that takes us back to their first date andre is introduced to meegan s toxic behavior in the way she mistreats their inoffensive chainrestaurant waiter , and , as always , he s appalled but unable to tear himself away it s about infatuation and selfabsorption , and does n't necessarily have anything to do with race mr peele s acid portrayal could be of an ego monster of any color on the other hand , the waiter is white , and it matters , though you could n't exactly say why , or would n't want to try that zone of ambiguity is what sets key peele apart it leaves us to read the cultural cues ourselves , and is n't that concerned if we ca n't keep up

some critics believed rick nash was the reason the did not win the stanley cup last year in his first full season in new york , nash , the topline left wing , posted weaker numbers than he did during the lockoutshortened 201213 campaign nash followed with an even more disappointing postseason last year , when he scored only three goals in 25 games , none in three of the four series , including the stanley cup final skeptics wondered if nash , a twotime 40goal scorer , was worth the highpriced , longterm commitment the rangers made when they traded for him in the summer of 2012 but this season , nash has silenced the critics through 44 games the unofficial first half of the rangers season he leads the team in goals , points , shots and plus minus and is probably a hart trophy candidate as the nhl s most valuable player nash was active again tuesday night against the in the rangers' final game before the break a 32 overtime win at madison square garden although he was kept off the scoreboard , and nearly put the puck into his own net late in the second period , he took five shots on goal , drew a secondperiod penalty and narrowly missed on at least two other occasions the rangers showcased scoring depth in the second period when kevin hayes picked up his sixth goal of the season at 9 minutes 29 seconds but the rangers surrendered two goals 1 03 apart in the second including erik karlsson s goahead goal on the power play at 14 41 chris kreider tied the game at 2 42 of the third with his 10th goal before carl hagelin won it at 2 55 of the extra session coach alain vigneault took nash off a line with derek stepan and martin st louis and matched him with derick brassard and mats zuccarello who shared a line with benoit pouliot last season he s really dynamic , plays in both ends , skates well , long reach , brassard said of nash it s been a lot of fun playing with him this year the move has also produced results nash entered play tuesday night against ottawa tied for the league lead in goals with 28 and was on pace for 54 which would be a career best he has recorded points in 30 games , and the rangers have won 16 of the 22 games in which nash has scored a goal and as that new line has come together , so too have the rangers they have won 16 of their last 19 and enter the break 5 points behind the islanders for the division lead we 're having a lot of success , brassard said he s been really good for our team , and he s one of the reasons why we 're at that stage right now nash s exploits earned him alternate captain status for team toews in this weekend s allstar game in columbus , where nash played for nine seasons he s a star player , zuccarello said that s what you expect i do n't know how long he s been in the league , but you 've seen that every year it s not like it s a surprise still , vigneault was unsatisfied by the effort of his top line , which was held off the scoresheet for the fourth time in five games i thought that line had some looks , but i definitely think with the skill level there and the compete level there that they can be better than what they showed tonight , vigneualt said they 're aware of that zuccarello said i think our strength is our team we have four lines rolling everyone can score , and everyone can defend , so i think we 're a good , solid team yet , of all nash s gifts , one is particularly underrated , according to goalie henrik lundqvist he s a pretty quiet guy , but he leads the way he plays , lundqvist said he plays hard , but the work ethic is so impressive to see i think it s inspiring for a lot of guys to see it s not all about scoring or points , it s about working hard and doing what s best for the team and he shows that it s great to have a guy like that on the team
i let maybelle touch my chest where the wire slides down my shoulder ouch , she says to me , touching me very softly hurts no , i tell her , it doesn t hurt this is helping me ! is this true \? my brain tumor is no longer shrinking for eight months i was on a particularly aggressive , challenging chemo and it was doing well until it wasn t ten weeks ago everybody at duke saw how encouraging my mri was great ! my medical team said looks like it might actually be shrinking ! six weeks later , on aug 6 , everything changed the tumor was growing even i could see it on the mri , and that is often not the case at first i tried a calm expression , but that quickly fell apart i started sobbing what does this mean \? i asked my doctors held my hands , and said they would do the best they could what does it mean for my life as a mother \? what does this mean for my child , a 7yearold whose life is filled with dancing , singing , swinging , who has down syndrome , who asks me to read books like alexander , and the terrible , horrible , no good , very bad day \? what does it mean that she laughs at that book when i understand its title in a different way \? i ve had a brain tumor for six years every time the tumor was growing , the doctors would try something new , and sometimes the tumor would stay still or even shrink for a little while i have always been frightened , but have had moments of hope when i was taking pills , i could take them without upsetting my daughter , and without informing my colleagues drugs like temodar , then ccnu , were frightening , but easy to take into my body now i m on iv infusion , and it s different i have a port , the way that blood can be removed and medication can be pumped in it s more visible to others it s hard plastic i assume it will stay in my body while i m alive the day i saw the growing tumor , my neurooncologist told me i needed to have a port soon like , now so one day while maybelle was at school , the interventional radiologist inserted my port and catheter , and in two weeks , i was ready to go my partner , brian , gently touched that spot , the first person to do it as the word went out , my colleagues and friends started expressing a series of feelings i think about you and all the lives you ve touched often it has been truly a pleasure , honor and privilege to know you others want to change this you wonder woman of brilliance , boldness , ferocity , humor and strength some assure me that this medication will fix anything , that everything will be fine others experience rage about this , and express it in words that can t be shared here , but are oddly comforting i feel all their love and support all of it and i suck it up as quickly as i can and ask for more but only my closest friends , brian , and my mother are willing to sit with me while i get treatment these are the people who will just sit with me , letting me fall apart when i had my first time with my iv infusion , i met one medical professional after another toward the end , i started sobbing when the pharmacist was halfway through her explanation i held my friend cindi s hand hard the pharmacist started apologizing , assuming that i was falling apart because of the medicine put into my iv infusion , but of course that wasn t what was hitting me so hard it was my daughter what will this mean for her \? i m not trying to fight the tumor as i ve told my friends , i m visualizing it dissolving , but i don t want to pretend that everything is going to be ok i want to be where i am i recognize that i will die of course , everybody will eventually die , but most of the time we can put it away and not think about it i m in a different place i don t know how long , but the doctors have seemed pleased that i m alive , because it means what they are doing is working for now when i had my first surgery six years ago , the medical team was hopeful it looked as if i was going to make it for a few years then a year ago , i had another surgery when brian was sitting with my neurooncologist , he asked about my future dr friedman said , she ll probably have another three years brian s face began to melt it was a mistake to ask now he knew and i knew , and there was no way to put it away maybelle hasn t really known me without a brain tumor it was discovered when she was 18 months old my friend got to charleston as quickly as she could that winter , and she took beautiful pictures of maybelle i looked at them and began making little requests to the universe please let me stay here until she is a 5 year old please let me see some of her new teeth emerge her first dance recital a fierce tantrum my girl my girl i ve got all of maybelle s legal and financial guardianship in place , so i don t have those details distracting me brian is one of the centers of maybelle s life , and mine i still have my job , which feels crucial i write i feel pretty well physically because the only thing that s wrong in my body is a brain tumor but none of that takes away my limitations , or my love and fear for maybelle sometimes i m ok sometimes i m so unhappy that i can t imagine how i am going to get through this i think at all kinds of levels often these focus on maybelle i ll wrap her in my arms and press myself against her body all the while , the thoughts and fears are chasing themselves around in my head how can i take care of her when i may be so exhausted that i won t be able to pick her up from school \? how will i feel when brian and maybelle are having dinner and i m asleep \? she can be difficult to understand who will listen to her , follow her communication , be able to share it with others \? will other people see down syndrome as simply part of who maybelle is \? and see her needs \? can i work hard enough that i can keep every possibility open for her even if i m not here to fight for her \? can i do enough \? what is enough \? what should i be wishing for , now \?
camp james e rudder , fla wearing a cap , sunglasses and a 75pound rucksack and carrying a 17pound machine gun , the young , buzzcut army officer quickly traversed a muddy river , pulling on a rope stretched between trees on either bank after a short break , the soldier shoved a black zodiac boat into the water for a twomile paddle with nine other soldiers , one of hundreds of tasks over nine weeks of ranger school , the top leadership course in the army it was hard to tell anything was different about the officer , except when she opened her mouth to ask for the names and blood types of the other soldiers so she could fill out a manifest for a simulated mission , or when she took off her cap to reveal hair cut a tad longer than that of her classmates if she and another female first lieutenant in the group manage to graduate this month from ranger school , one of the most physically and mentally challenging courses in the military , they will be the first women to do so they will also be the only graduates who will not be permitted , for now at least , to actually try out for the , or to serve as infantry or tank officers anywhere in the army but the women s performance is being closely watched as the army and other services grapple with how far to go in integrating women into combat roles among the questions soon to be answered is whether women will be eligible for any of the most dangerous jobs , like the ranger battalions that often work with the nation s premier counterterrorism organization , the joint special operations command , and that serve as a farm team for the army s most elite unit , delta force in 2013 , the it was lifting its formal ban on women in combat , a nod not only to gender equality but also to the de facto progression of women toward the front lines that had been going on for more than a decade , from marine female engagement teams to the that accompany rangers , navy seal teams and other special operators on raids women even perform intelligence gathering and other tasks in seal team 6 s topsecret black squadron there have been women in combat since the wars kicked off , said sgt first class frances espinalteter , a female soldier assigned to observe the training here , who supports women in the infantry she was deployed to iraq a dozen years ago as a military police officer and top gunner in a humvee , and later served alongside marines and seal members in afghanistan the services have until jan 1 to decide which positions they still want to keep off limits to women , and they must provide a rationale for each , with the defense secretary making the final call the progress of the two female officers , and 17 other women who started ranger school this year but did not make it this far , is expected to help inform that decision , as well as whether to continue to allow women to attend ranger school , which was open only to men before this year the military s other major infantry service , the marines , recently opened its rigorous infantry officer course to women , but none of the 29 female officers who started the program passed though only 3 percent of soldiers in the activeduty army have earned ranger tabs , it is an unofficial prerequisite for obtaining many infantry commands , and an explicit requirement for leading combat troops in the ranger regiment it is also a significant career enhancer even for officers who do not serve in combat units out of privacy concerns and a desire to not create distractions for students or instructors near the end of an exhausting twomonth course , the army has not disclosed the names of the two women , both graduates it also did not allow interviews with students , as is standard practice yet it has invited journalists to observe their training , a move intended to help dispel the idea that the women have been cut any special slack about 4 , 000 officers and enlisted soldiers start the ranger course every year , but only about two out of five graduate students drill and train with little sleep , carrying packs and combat equipment that typically weigh between 65 and 90 pounds , and over 61 days they carry out tactical patrols that cumulatively cover the same distance as walking from new york city to boston col david g fivecoat , the commander of the army s airborne and ranger training brigade , says the female students are competing on the same terms as the 160 men still in their class no flexedarmhangs instead of pullups no pushups from the knees the same cutoff times \( 40 minutes for a fivemile run , for example \) and the same number of repetitions in the initial physical assessment \( 49 pushups , 59 situps , six chinups \) the two women have performed well on the least subjective evaluations , like fitness tests and hikes with heavy backpacks , including a steep 18mile trek up mount yonah in georgia everybody s backpack weighed the same , colonel fivecoat said , and they all had to put one foot in front of the other aside from slightly longer \( but still buzzcut \) hair , the only official allowances for their sex are that the female officers are allowed to take prescription birth control \( students generally cannot bring prescription drugs to the course \) and when in barracks the women rotate shower and latrine time with the men , and string up ponchos as makeshift curtains when dressing the two women have gotten good marks in another key evaluation criteria peer assessments , where classmates rank one another on how good a teammate and leader other students are , and how much they would want to be with them in combat the one major area where the two women have struggled is where male students also often stumble on graded patrols , where students take turns roleplaying as platoon leaders , platoon sergeants or squad leaders , and are evaluated on how they plan and execute missions meant to simulate what it is like for young army officers and noncommissioned officers to lead troops during deployments , it also tests how well the students improvise , such as reacting to a surprise mortar attack , said capt george calhoun , a platoon tactical trainer who served as a platoon leader in afghanistan do they seize up and just dive for cover \? or do they immediately report their casualties and other information to their company commander , and see whether there is artillery or helicopters or jets that can return fire \? of the 19 women who began ranger school this year , most failed the early phases , though one , a major who is also a west point graduate , is now recycling , or retaking , an earlier phase in hopes of progressing to this last segment , which takes place at camp james e rudder , deep inside eglin air force base in the swampy , sweltering heat of north florida the decision on who graduates will not be made until later this month , but typically more than three out of four candidates who make it this far graduate with their class the two female lieutenants at camp rudder have had to recycle phases , and they have taken longer to make it to the final phase than most students who ultimately graduate from ranger school but officers say it is not uncommon for male graduates to have to redo the same number of tasks as the women have traditionalists , meanwhile , have not been happy about the potential of women serving combat roles , fearing they will destroy unit cohesion or lead to lowered standards as a point man for one of the biggest debates in the military , colonel fivecoat has been on the receiving end of personal attacks on facebook and elsewhere there is definitely a group out there that is very vocal about this thing , and they 're not real happy with it , he said first the naysayers said , they 're not going be able to do this , ' and then they did it , and then they said , they are not going be able do this part , ' and they did it and even some influential supporters of expanding the roles women play in combat and commando units , like retired adm eric t olson , a former head of the military s special operations command , stop short of endorsing women for all combat jobs mr olson said last month that he questioned how tactical leaders will respond to being in a position to put women to take the first bullet on a target the course was also parodied on a militarysatire website , duffel blog , which joked that a was intended to make it harder for female ranger candidates colonel fivecoat would not say whether he supported women serving in the infantry because he did not want to get out in front of his own commanders but allowing them to attend ranger school was a nobrainer why would you not want them to get this training , so they can be the best they can possibly be \? he said
hong kong it was a breakthrough in one of the biggest mysteries in aviation history when a wing part belonging to a boeing 777 was found last week on the remote indian ocean island of r union , the world took notice , echoing the intense news media coverage that followed the disappearance of malaysia airlines flight 370 on march 8 , 2014 but in the nation where the illfated flight originated , where its crew members were from and whose government owned the plane , the people s attention was focused elsewhere on a huge political scandal involving almost 700 million in funds that mysteriously appeared in bank accounts belonging to s prime minister , najib razak even mr najib s in the early hours of thursday claiming that the wing part , called a flaperon , was conclusively confirmed to have been from flight 370 looks to have been aimed at bolstering his standing in malaysia , said clive kessler , an emeritus professor at the university of new south wales in sydney , australia , who has studied malaysia since the mid1960s as the scandal consumed the nation in july , mr najib went virtually into hiding and refused to answer questions about it , mr kessler said this give him a chance for him to get out there and get out early and to be the griever in chief and the father of the nation , mr kessler said by telephone from the malaysian capital , kuala lumpur the revelation of the funds , described this week by malaysia s anticorruption commission as a gift to the prime minister from unknown sources , has shaken popular confidence in mr najib s government so , too , have his administration s heavyhanded attempts to stifle public comment about the affair and the official inquiries into it , including shutting down newspapers , dismissing members of his cabinet and ordering of anticorruption officials according to malaysian news reports , the government has been investigating leaks of documents related to the revelation the malaysian anticorruption commission , for its part , is investigating the heavily indebted state development fund , 1malaysia development berhad , or 1mdb , which has been the focus of news media attention as the possible source of the funds on monday , the commission said that the 26 billion ringgit , or 6635 million , transferred to mr najib s accounts was not from 1mdb but instead merely from donors in the same , the commission said that none of its officers were involved in a conspiracy to overthrow the government , suggesting how strong it believed the repercussions from the scandal might be the malaysian population pays a lot of attention to the 1mdb issue as expected , said oh ei sun , a senior fellow at the s rajaratnam school of international studies in singapore who was mr najib s political secretary from 2009 to 2011 i do n't think a lot of people really pay a lot of attention to the mh370 investigations indeed , the prime minister s statement on thursday about the discovery of the wing part was given extensive and positive coverage by the official news media , noted mr kessler , the australian academic those outlets included , the mouthpiece of mr najib s united malays national organization , the party that has dominated malaysia s politics since the country attained independence from britain in 1957 but that was not the case internationally , and mr najib s announcement also with french officials , who were analyzing the part because it was found on r union , a french department his statement went further than what french and american experts would say about the wing part , with the french saying only that they had very strong presumptions that the flaperon was from flight 370 french ire was further raised on thursday when malaysia s transport minister said a malaysian team in r union had found more aircraft debris , a claim quickly denied by the french on friday , the minister , liow tiong lai , speaking in an with cnn , described the differences between mr najib s statement and that of the french as a choice of words , and repeated the claim that the malaysian team had found additional plane debris on r union still , there seemed little chance that developments regarding the missing airliner would overshadow the political scandal at home , said wan saiful wan jan , chief executive of the institute for democracy and economic affairs , an independent research institute in kuala lumpur when it comes to an issue like this , unless he gives some proper answers in full , it s almost impossible to divert elsewhere , he said of mr najib while some members of the governing establishment , including the former longtime prime minister , mahathir mohamad , have turned against him , many political analysts say mr najib s position remains safe at the moment but there are concerns about government institutions being increasingly drawn into the political fray as the authorities pursue an investigation of possible leaks from the anticorruption commission the transfers to mr najib s bank accounts were reported last month in the wall street journal and the britishbased  the relative independence of the bureaucracy may be affected , said ibrahim suffian , program director at merdeka center , an independent polling and research firm in malaysia a representative of the prime minister s office was not available to comment zaid ibrahim , a former minister in charge of legal affairs and the founder of the country s biggest private law firm , said in a blog post dated thursday that mr najib s efforts to hinder efforts to investigate 1mdb and his own finances were undermining malaysian society the government is actively engaging in doing everything in their power to cover up mismanagement , corruption , abuse of power , mr zaid wrote the people , especially the opposition leaders and those active in social media today live in fear of the prime minister and his hatchet men our public institutions are in disarray and their independence is under assault mr oh , the former aide to mr najib , said that the uproar over the funds was laying bare the shortcomings of the malaysian political system , which gives extraordinary powers to the prime minister s office separation of powers in theory is there , but in practice malaysia is still very much what we would call an executivedominated type of pseudodemocracy , he said
wimberley , tex they descended on this tiny town in the hundreds on wednesday , volunteers who spread out on foot , in offroad vehicles and fanboats and even aboard private helicopters to search the wreckage and muck along normally idyllic rivers for seven people still missing three days after floodwaters ravaged the area friends , coworkers and relatives of the missing , along with strangers who felt they could not just sit at home , mustered at the first baptist church of wimberley , trying to apply order to a landscape turned to chaos people lined up for search team assignments , maps on the wall marked grids for each team , a table held essential supplies like batteries and bug spray , and relatives and friends pored through photos textmessaged by searchers , hoping to recognize items found in the debris it s inspiring , and it brings to me a sense of family and community that i did n't know was out there , said john charba , a cousin of one of the missing people , randy charba , as he waited in the church for his assignment somebody came out alive 12 and a half miles downstream , so there is hope this was the largest of many search operations across a region that has been battered since saturday by severe thunderstorms , flooding and tornadoes , leaving at least 19 people dead in texas and oklahoma and 14 in mexico , with others missing and the toll expected to rise two more bodies were found wednesday , including one of eight people who had been missing from a vacation house here that was carried off and dashed to pieces by the blanco river after years of drought , water has suddenly become lethally abundant in texas , covering farms and streets , straining dams , wiping away neighborhoods and bridges , and clogging streams and bayous with uprooted trees and ruined cars even in a region used to tropical storms and hurricanes , in city after city , people used similar language to describe torrential rains and cresting rivers the worst they had seen in decades , or simply the worst ever gov greg abbott has declared 47 texas counties disaster areas , and even as people tried to dry out , more rain fell wednesday , with still more in the forecast one of the hardesthit places was houston , where flooding killed at least six people monday and tuesday and two were still missing the city was mostly functional again on wednesday after crews towed some of the thousands of waterlogged cars and trucks highways that 24 hours earlier had been chestdeep in muddy water and clogged with ruined vehicles were once again usable but some underpasses remained flooded , and bayous still ran menacingly high city officials said 4 , 000 buildings had water damage , and 100 , 000 gallons of untreated wastewater had spilled into one of the city s bayous the greatest toll in the united states may turn out to be here in hays county , southwest of austin , where four people were confirmed dead and eight to 10 were still missing after thunderstorms dropped almost a foot of rain in the span of a few hours , clay soil kept it from soaking into the ground gorges funneled it into a few streams and late saturday and early sunday , the usually tame blanco river surged 40 feet above flood stage , sweeping away houses , vehicles , roads and bridges in one of those houses were nine people from three families vacationing together one of them , laura s mccomb , called her sister , julie shields , and said , we 're in a house that s now floating down the river , ms shields told the call mom and dad i love you , and pray ms mccomb s husband , jonathan , is the only person from the house found alive so far far downstream and badly injured one of the bodies found wednesday was that of another occupant , michelle carey charba , the wife of randy charba , whose family released a statement saying , we are all devastated the other seven occupants including a 4yearold girl and two 6yearold boys have not been found friends and relatives of those three families organized the volunteer search directed from the church , while more than 100 emergency workers , including crews specializing in search and rescue , also combed the area one of 20 volunteer search teams , sweating and swatting away mosquitoes in the sticky heat , slogged through ankledeep mud along the san marcos river , which is fed by the blanco with a warning about snakes and instructions to mark each pile they searched , they poked through clumps of branches , bits of houses , and items like sandals , a briefcase , a duffle bag and sunglasses another flipflop over here !

may be the least recognizable of justices i doubt if one american in a thousand could pick him out of a lineup those who do know the name , if not the face , of the 64yearold justice most likely lump him with the other conservatives who as a bloc dominate the roberts court but to the political right , and to a degree that has escaped general attention , sam alito is much more than just a face in the conservative crowd he s something special he is a rock star and not only for at gatherings of the conservative federalist society he is the redemption of the promise that failed a quartercentury ago , when john h sununu , chief of staff to president george hw bush , assured worried conservatives that the president had selected a holeinone supreme court nominee  conservatives are confident that unlike chief justice , who committed the unpardonable sin of saving the affordable care act , sam alito will never go soft in the crunch unlike justice , he is utterly reliable \( will justice alito vote for a right to , as justice kennedy is widely expected to do \? not on your life \) unlike justice , whose rhetorical excesses yield diminishing returns these days \( his perfervid dissent in the 2013 has been widely cited by lower court judges as demonstrating that the constitutional basis for a right to samesex marriage is now beyond debate \) , sam alito is never bombastic and he avoids the selfindulgent eccentricity that has rendered justice clarence thomas a nonplayer in the november issue of the religious journal , prof michael stokes paulsen , describing justice alito as the man of the hour , accurately labeled him the most consistent , solid , successful conservative on the court , adding there are louder talkers , flashier stylists , wittier wits , morepoisonous pens , but no one with a more level and solid swing than justice samuel alito i'm sure that professor paulsen of the university of st thomas school of law in minneapolis did n't mean to imply that justice alito shines only by comparison with imperfect colleagues in conservative eyes , justice alito s merit is not relative but absolute he delivers not only in the big cases , like last june , in which he wrote the majority opinion upholding the right of a corporation s religious owners to an exemption from the federal mandate to include contraception coverage in their employee health plan , but also in less visible moves that do n't get much public attention but that speak powerfully to the base it sounds discordant to suggest that a supreme court justice has a base , but sam alito has one one of several recent hagiographic articles in the rightwing press was one in the back in may , describing samuel alito as one of the noblest men in american public life today this month marks the start of justice alito s 10 year on the supreme court he took his seat on jan 31 , 2006 , chosen by president george w bush to succeed justice sandra day o'connor and confirmed by a vote of 58 to 42 after a feeble democratic effort collapsed the alitoforo'connor substitution was the most consequential change on the court since the first president bush picked clarence thomas to replace justice in 1991 none of the six subsequent departures \( in addition to justice o'connor , they were justices byron r white and harry a blackmun , chief justice william h rehnquist , and justices souter and john paul stevens \) produced anything like the ideological lurch caused by the replacement of a moderately conservative compromise seeker with a lifelong movement conservative in 1985 , a 35yearold samuel alito in the reagan justice department with an essay asserting that as a teenager in the 1960s , the greatest influences on my views were the writings of william f buckley jr , the national review , and barry goldwater s 1964 campaign i 'll leave to others a detailed examination of justice alito s nine years on the court rather , my purpose is to look not specifically at his jurisprudence but at the increasingly distinctive role he is carving out for himself inside the institution of course , those are not completely distinct inquiries the record informs the role a former federal prosecutor , he is probably the most proprosecution member of a proprosecution court during the past two terms , in the 19 criminal cases on which the court was divided , justice alito voted least often for the defendant once \( in that case , , he dissented from a decision that upheld a conviction for making a false statement in connection with buying a gun , a violation of the gun control act of 1968 \) i mentioned earlier that justice alito plays an inside game it takes several forms one is his role in shaping the court s docket , which in turn plays a major role in setting the country s legal agenda the supreme court cultivates an image as a passive recipient of the legal issues that people deposit on its doorstep that s true , except when it s not some issues reach the court by subtle or not so subtle invitation , when a justice sends a signal that a particular agenda is n't well served by the case at hand but could be advanced by a better one justice alito , one of the most antilabor justices to serve on the supreme court since the new deal , is currently using this technique to solicit challenges to the survival of publicsector unions first in two years ago , and most recently last june in , he has invited antiunion forces to bring the court a case that could serve as a vehicle for overturning , a 38yearold precedent under which public employees who refuse to join the union can nonetheless be required to pay the portion of union dues that cover the expenses of collective bargaining the perfect case has n't yet reached the court neither of the two recent cases quite did the job but , not surprisingly , the pipeline is filling up with potential candidates another inside move is what i 'll call a straight play to the base here s an example for which i can think of no other explanation it dates back to 2009 , when the court unanimously overturned a writ of that a federal appeals court had granted to an inmate on ohio s death row the issue was evidently so clear to all nine justices that they did n't bother to set the case for argument , instead simply ruling on the basis of the state s petition the unsigned opinion , , rejected the inmate s claim that his legal representation at sentencing fell below minimal constitutional standards the anonymous justice who wrote the opinion observed that the inmate s lawyers appeared to have fully complied with the s standards for capital representation that were in effect at the time of the trial the lawyers did all they might have been expected to do this is not a case , the court maintained , in which powerful mitigating evidence would have been apparent from documents any reasonable attorney would have obtained as an example of the opposite kind of case , a case in which defense lawyers fell glaringly short of their professional obligations , the court offered the analysis contained in a 2005 supreme court decision , that case was one of the final decisions of the rehnquist court , a rare win for a deathrow defendant by a vote of 5 to 4 , with justice o'connor in the majority , the court held that an appeals court had been wrong when , finding the lawyers' behavior acceptable , it overturned the trial court s grant of habeas corpus as it happened , the had been written by samuel alito , then a judge on the united states court of appeals for the third circuit back to the supreme court s decision in the ohio case justice alito joined the unanimous unsigned opinion , but something clearly set him off maybe it was the court s reference to the rompilla case , but protocol left him with nothing he could say about that in any event , he turned on the american bar association , an establishment outfit if there ever was one \( justice lewis f powell jr had been its president , and chief justice roberts spoke at its annual meeting last august \) but long a target in some conservative circles for the progressive views the organization has occasionally stumbled onto despite having received its highest rating of well qualified at the time of his supreme court nomination , justice alito is clearly bothered by the aba bothered a lot in a oneparagraph concurring opinion , he sort of explained he was joining the court s opinion , he said , but writing separately to emphasize my understanding that the opinion in no way suggests that the american bar association s guidelines for the appointment and performance of defense counsel in death penalty cases have special relevance in determining whether an attorney s performance meets the standard required by the sixth amendment the aba , he added , was a private group with limited membership \( the 400 , 000member association , neither exclusive nor limited , is in fact open to all lawyers , and nonlawyers as well , and is actively trying to grow the \) justice alito continued it is the responsibility of the courts to determine the nature of the work that a defense attorney must do in a capital case in order to meet the obligations imposed by the constitution , and i see no reason why the aba guidelines should be given a privileged position in making that determination no other member of the court signed onto his opinion but one or more justices may think twice before offering a garland to the aba in the future and thus provoking another outburst justice alito s disdain for organizations of professionals is n't limited to the american bar association the supreme court ruled in 2002 that the execution of an intellectually disabled defendant amounts to cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the eighth amendment the decision , , left open the question of how to identifyintellectual disability last may , in , the court ruled by a vote of 5 to 4 that florida s definition , a fixed cutoff iq score of 70 or less , was too rigid to meet constitutional standards justice kennedy s majority opinion cited a brief from the american psychological association asserting that an iq score alone could fail to capture severe deficits in a person s functional abilities in determining who qualifies as intellectually disabled , it is proper to consult the medical community s opinions , justice kennedy wrote i cannot follow the court s logic , justice alito objected , striking a populist tone in his dissenting opinion under our modern eighth amendment cases , what counts are our society s standards which is to say , the standards of the american people not the standards of professional associations , which at best represent the views of a small professional elite the judgment was for legislatures , he said , not for courts and not for doctors i 'll conclude by describing a recent intervention of justice alito s in a case that is still playing out at the court the incident received almost no attention it s so odd that i 'll just explain what has happened so far rather than try to characterize it on oct 27 , an reached the court on behalf of an inmate on missouri s death row , scheduled for execution at midnight the next day the inmate , mark a christeson , was convicted of a gruesome triple murder of a woman and her two children , committed in 1998 when he was 18 years old after his conviction became final in the state courts , the federal district court in missouri appointed two lawyers to represent him in filing a habeas corpus petition but the lawyers , eric butts and phil horwitz , neglected to meet with him for 11 months and missed the filing deadline by 117 days the district court then dismissed the untimely petition mr christeson now wants a team of lawyers from saint louis university school of law to represent him in trying to refile the habeas corpus petition , but the original lawyers have refused to turn over their files or give up their appointment the question for the supreme court , in the petition filed by the new lawyers , is whether the district court should be required to make the substitution in the interests of justice at the supreme court , each justice has administrative responsibility for one or more of the 13 federal appellate circuits justice alito is the circuit justice for his old court , the third circuit , as well as for the eighth circuit , which includes missouri in this capacity , on the morning of oct 28 , justice alito issued an order to the saint louis law school team to file a supplemental brief regarding whether the record shows that the inmate had authorized them to seek substitution as his lawyers with the scheduled execution hours away , the lawyers , jennifer a merrigan , john r mills and joseph j perkovich , were momentarily stymied the information justice alito demanded was n't contained in the record of the case nor would similar information be found in the record of any case a record does n't deal with legal representation legal ethics experts i spoke with could n't say justice alito s demand was unprecedented , but they could n't recall another one like it ordinarily , the terms of a representation between lawyer and client are protected by attorneyclient privilege the saint louis lawyers solved the problem by obtaining a waiver of the privilege from their client , who in august had signed a threepage representation form the lawyers attached the form to their brief hours later , the court granted mr christeson a stay of execution , to last while the justices consider whether to hear his appeal if the court denies his petition , the stay will terminate if the justices accept the case for argument , the stay will continue until the court issues a decision justice alito , along with justices scalia and thomas , dissented without explanation from the order granting the stay the justices have now taken up the case , , for consideration at five weekly closeddoor conferences , an unusual development that almost certainly means that somebody is writing something some number of justices may be trying to resolve the case summarily , without hearing argument or perhaps the majority judgment is to deny the petition , and three justices are circulating a dissent aimed at persuading a colleague to cast the fourth vote necessary to hear a case it s unclear how soon the mystery , let alone the case , might be resolved the justices are scheduled to take it up again on friday , their first conference back from a fourweek recess one thing seems all but certain if the court eventually rules in the inmate s favor , justice alito will dissent
paris for at least a little while longer , the turtles can live and swim in peace for at least a little while longer , the construction permits for the latest expansion project as the local and national authorities squabble among themselves and so the turtles , who dwell in a small pool filled with flat rocks in a greenhouse in the botanical gardens adjacent to roland garros stadium , can remain , none the wiser , in their modest abode the french tennis federation s plan , , calls for the tournament to build a new show court with a capacity of 4 , 800 in the gardens , les serres d'auteuil , which until now have been a place of calm and reflection during the tournament \( as well as the other 50 weeks of the year \) for the few who wander into them but a loose and vocal coalition of neighbors , ecologists and other groups is still trying to block that project their latest proposal rejects the idea of destroying the row of greenhouses \( the most historic and attractive would be preserved \) and advancing into the botanical gardens it s a scandal , an outraged worker in the gardens said this week , declining to give his name for fear of losing his job all this for a twoweek tennis tournament instead , the opposition backs an alternative plan that would entail covering a highway that runs near the stadium and expanding the grand slam event in a different direction the tennis federation once embraced that laborintensive concept when it proposed to build a stadium just inside the large municipal park next door , the bois de boulogne , as part of paris s 2012 summer olympic bid but in a close vote times , needs and tones have since changed \( even as paris inches closer to , for the 2024 summer games \) , and the situation now , according to gilbert ysern , the french federation s general director , can be summed up as greenhouses or bust this project is magnificent , it fills a need , ysern this week if we do n't have the construction permits , we should go see people interested elsewhere in the world to see if they want to buy roland garros and have it where they are i'm joking , but if we 're not capable of making this project happen , it will be a kind of death sentence for the tournament clearly , rhetoric is soaring and nerves are fraying , which is understandable , considering that it has now been four years since to keep the french open at its current site in paris proper instead of moving the whole claycovered operation to versailles , marnelavall e or some other distant suburb the agreement hinged on the ability to expand into the gardens and also build a retractable roof over the main philippe chatrier court the work was all supposed to be completed by 2016 for now , the new plan is for the garden court , which would be contained in a transparent greenhouse structure of its own , to be ready by 2017 the roof over chatrier and the other major changes to the current grounds , including the destruction of the particularly atmospheric courts 1 and 2 , would have to wait until 2019 but that timetable only works if the federation can break ground by september , which will depend , in part , on the outcome of meetings being held next week by the council of paris to consider the merits of the alternative , highwaycovering proposal those meetings will be held smack in the middle of the opening week of the tournament , which will only magnify the proceedings meanwhile , the , long a grand slam laggard in the raindelay department , is , which is set to be ready by 2016 meanwhile , the australian open , no longer clearly the weakest link in the grand slam chain , , margaret court arena , and continued to expand facilities and its boomtime atmosphere at a rapid clip the french open s problems are real it is far too crowded far too much of the time \( it s not easy to be chic when your pastel blazer or diaphanous dress is being crushed in a scrum of spectators trying to get from a concession stand to an outside court \) roland garros stadium s current grounds are by far the smallest of the four grand slam tournaments , and they will remain the smallest even if the proposed expansion is approved lesspredictable weather patterns mean that the roof over chatrier has become a necessity , even if claycourt tennis can be played in a drizzle \( see roger federer s \) but the french open , even under duress , still has its undeniable charms and privileges with the us open returning for the long term to a 14day schedule , the french open is the only significant professional tournament in the world that lasts 15 days , beginning on a sunday claycourt tennis is also an essential , aesthetically soothing antidote to the sneakersqueaking , jointjarring version of the game played on hard courts , which remains preeminent today but has been responsible for shortening careers there is also , of course , paris , although officially in london , is a village the us open , although officially in new york , is in queens and from the tourist hub of manhattan , home of the australian open , is a pleasant , leafy and increasingly sophisticated city but no oldworld charmer at roland garros , you can still see the eiffel tower from the top of the main stadium whether or not the parisians agree to expand on time or according to plan , the tournament is clearly in a toughtotrump location as for the turtles , they have some fine digs of their own , at least for a little while longer

some people land gyrocopters on the lawn at the capitol to protest big money in politics lawrence lessig , the harvard professor and democratic theorist , is thinking of running for president on tuesday morning , mr lessig will announce that he will explore a protest bid for the democratic nomination if he can raise 1 million in small donations by labor day , mr lessig said , he will run the effort follows years of more conventional activism , including new hampshire protest marches that gave mr lessig a following in liberal circles and a super pac that in 2014 tried \( and mostly failed \) to elect democratic and republican candidates who would back efforts to empower small donors in politics the democratic field already includes a range of major and minor candidates , among them hillary rodham clinton , martin o malley , and senator bernie sanders of vermont , all of whom have pledged their support for overturning the supreme court s citizens united decision in an interview , mr lessig said that after years of unfulfilled promises by democratic candidates on the issue of money in politics , he was driven to mount a candidacy built around it the reason i ve been driven to this is the constant emperor wears no clothes feeling about this election , said mr lessig , who will also campaign against gerrymandering and restrictive voting laws we need a plan for unrigging the system first , and none of them have given us that plan he added you want to rail against wall street , as o malley does or bernie sanders does \? great but , he continued , unless you fix the way we fund campaigns , we re not going to take on the largest funder of congressional campaigns in america mr lessig said if he could raise enough money , he would campaign 24 hours a day for the democratic nomination he also said there were a hundred successes short of winning the white house eugene mccarthy didn t win , but he certainly made the vietnam war an issue , brought down a president , mr lessig said , referring to the then senator s 1968 primary campaign against president lyndon b johnson , which helped persuade mr johnson not to seek reelection reminded that the 1968 election ended with the election of a republican , richard m nixon , mr lessig added of course , the wrong president won in 1968
chapel hill , nc few things are tougher for a parent than dealing with a child s serious medical condition , particularly if it is complicated and hard to diagnose the parent has to make hard choices about treatment , navigating conflicting advice from doctors or even rejecting one doctor s opinion and seeking another recently , the situation of these parents has gotten even harder some doctors and hospitals have begun to level a radical new charge medical child abuse against parents who , they say , get unnecessary or excessive treatment for their kids that this care is usually ordered by other doctors has n't protected parents from these loaded accusations although most of these cases have nothing to do with real child abuse , credulous child welfare officials have too often supported the doctors , threatened parents with loss of custody , and even removed kids from their homes simply because the parents disagreed with the doctor s plan of care perhaps the most notorious such case is that of justina pelletier , a teenager who was being treated for mitochondrial disease , or mito , a rare metabolic disorder that interferes with energy production on the advice of a metabolic geneticist at tufts medical center who was treating her , she was admitted in 2013 to boston children s hospital , so that she could see her longtime gastroenterologist , who had recently moved there without consulting the girl s doctor at tufts , boston children s concluded that the girl s problem was not mito , but largely psychiatric , according to the boston globe when her parents disagreed and sought to transfer her back to tufts , boston children s called child protection , asserting that the parents were harmfully interfering in her care although the tufts geneticist supported the mito diagnosis , a juvenile court judge deferred to boston children s assessment , and justina s parents lost custody after more than 16 months in state custody , much of it spent in a locked psychiatric ward , justina was finally returned to her parents still in a wheelchair , still sick the term medical child abuse dates from the mid1990s , as a condition related to , a mental disturbance in which a parent induces illness in a child to get attention it has caught on with doctors over the last decade but what constitutes unnecessary medical care the heart of the test for medical child abuse is vague and subjective after all , doctors often disagree with one another when it comes to the diagnosis and treatment of complicated conditions i write from experience my husband and i are lucky not to have been charged with medical child abuse during the eight years we tried to find answers to our daughter s mysterious illness her symptoms began when she was 10 and had her first the headaches became so frequent , nauseating and painful that she missed most school for two years eventually , at 13 , she received a diagnosis of postural orthostatic syndrome , an autonomic nervous system disorder we learned how to deal with this condition , but when our daughter was 15 , her health deteriorated once again she started to fall first once a day , then five times , then 20 times a day the , fatigue and nausea worsened when her neurologist refused to believe that the falls were caused by anything besides faintness from the nervous system disorder though we could see that she was fully conscious and that her legs were n't working properly during the falls we sought out other experts none could explain the falls meanwhile , our daughter spent two years using a wheelchair to go all but the shortest of distances many doctors suggested that she was exaggerating or even faking her symptoms a few thought her symptoms resulted from psychological factors like stress others surmised that the problem was me perhaps because i had migraines when i was younger , i was overly sensitive to her pain or perhaps my refusal to accept the doctors' conclusions was preventing my daughter from dealing with her psychological issues when she was 18 , our daughter learned that some patients with her nervoussystem disorder had been diagnosed with mitochondrial disease , which would also explain her intermittent leg weakness we consulted a mito expert , and almost wept with relief when she believed our account of our daughter s symptoms tests confirmed that our daughter had mito with luck and a team of exceptional doctors , she managed to get her life back she recently finished her third year of college her wheelchair gathers dust in our basement as i 've researched medical child abuse over the past year , several advocacy and support groups for patients with rare diseases told me they had seen an alarming rise in medical child abuse charges mitoaction \( which supports patients with mito \) the american partnership for eosinophilic disorders \( disorders relating to white blood cells \) the ehlersdanlos national foundation \( a rare disorder of the connective tissues \) and dysautonomia international \( autonomic nervous system disorders \) through these groups , i 've surveyed 95 parents who have been accused , in 30 states dr frances d kendall , the geneticist in atlanta who diagnosed my daughter s mitochondrial disease , told me that she has seen a rising number of cases in which the parents of children with mito had been wrongly charged dr mark s korson , the geneticist who treated justina pelletier at tufts , also said that such charges have snowballed in recent years most states lump medical child abuse into general child abuse or neglect statistics , and ca n't break out separate numbers michigan is an exception its figures show that , on average , 51 charges of medical abuse have been made against caretakers each year between 2010 and 2013 extrapolating this to the national population would mean more than 1 , 600 charges each year the precursor to medical child abuse , munchausen syndrome by proxy , dates from 1977 , when a british pediatrician published case studies of two mothers who had intentionally sickened their children in one case , fatally to get attention however , controversy developed about whether this was a genuine psychological disorder , what motivated the mother \( it is almost always mothers who are charged \) and , critically , how to distinguish munchausen mothers from those caring for genuinely sick kids munchausen charges were generally discredited after several mothers were shown to have been wrongly convicted based on grossly deficient expert testimony sadly , while knowledge of munchausen traveled across the atlantic , skepticism about it did not starting in the mid1990s , two doctors dr carole jenny , a pediatrician specializing in child abuse , and her husband , dr thomas a roesler , a psychiatrist proposed that munchausen s taint could be avoided by reconceptualizing the condition doctors , they said , should n't focus on the parent s mental state \( as in munchausen \) but , instead , simply determine whether the child had received unnecessary and harmful , or potentially harmful , care at the behest of a parent they defined potentially harmful to include any unnecessary medicine or diagnostic test that could have harmful side effects , even if the child was n't actually harmed such care , they argued , should be labeled medical child abuse , and treated like any other kind of child abuse but there is no solid evidence that their standard helps to sort out parents who intentionally use medical care to hurt their children from wellmeaning , innocent parents indeed , drs jenny and roesler recognized that most kids identified by their criteria were truly sick \( though they believe the kids received excessive , inappropriate care \) and that their criteria identified far more parents than the standard munchausen criteria dr richard g boles , a mitochondrial disease specialist who has worked on some 100 cases involving suspected medical child abuse , said that only about five fit the classic munchausen situation and should be considered abuse of the rest , he says , about twothirds involved a demanding mother who got on a doctor s nerves the remainder involved a parent who was too anxious in dealing with doctors who could n't give adequate answers compounding the problems with the overly broad definition of medical child abuse is the considerable misinformation spread by its proponents in 2013 , a governor s task force in michigan stated that many cases of medical child abuse go undetected because caregivers are skilled at deceiving the medical community no hard evidence , however , suggests that such parents are anything but rare medical child abuse is far more likely overcharged than undercharged the task force identified these warning signs of medical child abuse a highly attentive parent who is unusually reluctant to leave his her child s side a parent who demands second and third opinions a parent who is not relieved or reassured when presented with negative test results and resists having the child discharged from the hospital and a parent who has unusually detailed medical knowledge these warning signs accurately describe many , if not most , loving parents of medically fragile children in its zealotry , the medical child abuse movement resembles two other panics from the recent past the sexabuse panic of the 1980s and 1990s and , more recently , the panic over shakenbaby syndrome in both panics , experts saw foul play where none existed , government officials took their views at face value , and people were wrongly convicted and imprisoned , their lives ruined medical child abuse is causing similar harm jessica and sean hilliard of attleboro , mass , went through the agony of watching their 5yearold daughter die in 2011 from what two outside specialists concluded was a genetic disease that affected mitochondrial function the couple asked boston children s , where the daughter died , to test their 3yearold son for the disease after he showed symptoms suggestive of it \( mito can run in families \) a hospital pediatrician specializing in child protection , citing a pattern of behavior that she contended suggested abuse , accused the parents of fabricating their son s medical issues , though she had not spoken with his outside doctors and therapists after the state declared the charges unfounded , the hilliards transferred their son s care to tufts , where he received several diagnoses , including mitochondrial disease even so , the boston children s pediatrician called a tufts doctor who focuses on child abuse , who then reported the parents for overmedicalization the state intervened , over the objections of doctors at tufts who were treating the boy to resolve the charges , the hilliards allowed him to be weaned off his medications this required a sixweek hospitalization , during which his condition deteriorated , until the treatments were restored again , the charges were dropped \( asked about the pelletier and hilliard cases , a spokesman for boston children s disputed the facts but said the hospital could not discuss specifics of these cases because of privacy restrictions he noted that health providers are obliged by law to report suspected abuse tufts said it could n't discuss the hilliard case \) sara and paul mayo of arlington , tex , checked their 16yearold daughter into cook children s medical center in fort worth last november it was her third admission in two months for acute with no clear cause this time , she had difficulty walking after taking her prescribed medications a hospitalist and a neurologist who had not treated their daughter previously diagnosed a psychological disorder , and said she required inpatient treatment when the mayos disagreed , asserting they wanted a second opinion from the mayo clinic \( no relation \) in rochester , minn , the texas hospital called the authorities to report their suspicions of medical child abuse the charges were dropped only after the mayo clinic found that the daughter had gastric , among other ailments \( a spokeswoman for cook children s said that she could not discuss the case because of confidentiality rules , but added that the hospital was morally and ethically obligated to protect children and would always err on the side of caution for that child \) our legal system protects parents' rights to make decisions for their kids , even if those decisions are sometimes less than ideal courts have long dealt with cases of neglect , in which parents are charged with denying kids necessary care in these cases , courts have allowed the state to require care only when doctors agree about the treatment , its medical benefits are clear , and its risks are small this exception is narrow because courts recognize that parents are usually far better positioned and motivated than doctors or the state to know and do what is in their child s best interests these protections should apply to medicalabuse charges government should not get involved when doctors disagree about a diagnosis or course of treatment , the doctors have full knowledge of the child s medical record , and a parent chooses one doctor s opinion over another s it should intervene only when there is evidence that a parent has intentionally provided significant misinformation to physicians , fabricated elements of the medical history or induced medical symptoms parents should always be allowed to seek second \( and third \) opinions we must protect children from the rare disturbed parent but medical child abuse , as it has been understood , is far too big and blunt an instrument to accomplish this purpose it has harmed too many genuinely sick kids , and made life hell for too many loving parents it is time to end the medical abuse panic

after the terrorist attacks in paris on nov 13 , president fran ois hollande took swift action , calling them an act of war and declaring a 12day national state of emergency days later , he asked parliament to approve a threemonth extension and a new security bill with emotions running high , the general assembly and senate voted overwhelmingly in favor french authorities now have the power to conduct warrantless searches , put people under house arrest or make them wear electronic bracelets , seize computers , impose curfews and ban public assemblies sweeping antiterrorism legislation passed last september and this past june had already authorized the government to impose travel bans , place listening devices in private homes , tap phones , shut down websites , and track keyboard strokes on private computers all without judicial oversight creating the potential for government abuse on tuesday , prime minister manuel valls said that the police had conducted more than 2 , 000 raids since nov 13 more than 260 people have been taken in for questioning almost all were detained , and more than 300 people have been put under house arrest with no oversight , it is impossible to know whether each action is justified on wednesday , interior minister bernard cazeneuve announced the government had shut down three mosques and four informal prayer rooms , while none had been closed in the 10 years before the government is also wielding its new powers to stifle dissent when people gathered in paris on sunday to defy the ban on demonstrations , the police used tear gas and arrested more than 200 people at least 24 french environmental activists have been placed under preventive house arrest mr hollande is planning to ask parliament to keep some emergency powers in place for six months and to prevent people from legally challenging their detention these are dangerous ideas the government already has more than enough antiterrorism measures at its disposal improving intelligencesharing and meticulously tracking individuals who have been identified as a potential threat would improve security without weakening constitutional protections against excessive executive power and threatening the civil rights of an entire nation parliament should also ensure that people under house arrest who represent no terrorist threat are freed immediately a prolonged state of emergency will only harm the very freedoms the terrorists seek to destroy
i came pretty late to jetsun mila , by the french composer , but it may be one of those things a lot of people will feel fine about coming to pretty late turn it on , and it just keeps teaching jetsun mila is an 84minute composition created in 1986 on an arp 2500 modular synthesizer , which was a large rectangular cabinet with over 100 knobs and 240 sliding switches , and a keyboard that ms radigue did n't use this was her primary instrument and muse for about 30 years \( now 83 , she changed over to writing instrumental music in 2000 \) the piece was inspired by the life of the 11thcentury tibetan yogi and poet jetsun milarepa , and i understand that it has nine interconnected sections to signify stages of life , death and rebirth in the tibetan tradition someday i will venture to understand how each stage corresponds with each section , but that will be later for now , and probably for years , there is going to be too much else there to deal with there is sound , which you already know about , and then there is what ms radigue is attuned to , sound s divisible ingredients jetsun mila is never very loud and not very dramatic , in the typical sense of that word it does n't really have rhythm , it has oscillations it does n't really have notes , it has frequencies with certain colors and depths it is inclusive and suggestive and abstract as it moves , you may automatically visualize what it reminds you of chimes , vehicles , chants , wind currents , lowbrass instruments none of that is actually there it s a kind of musical protolanguage , and there is no question that ms radigue is controlling it by careful design , but only after having lived with it first in a about her process of making music with the modular synthesizer , ms radigue once said i am not even speaking about what i have done with these sounds that s another story , the way in which i organized them but above all i did listen to them with the greatest respect , trying to understand what they had to say here , you 're saying this oh , there you 're saying that do you get along well together \? yes , that seems to work so we can go on jetsun mila , available on itunes or as a double cd from , has an expanded sense of the present it has lots of authority and zero austerity it has the charged organization of a great work in itself this is why i am recommending it specifically yet it indicates a general disposition , or a style of creativity , that does n't really need to be formatted into discrete , copyrightable compositions you may find yourself drawn to what s behind it rather than its surfaces i roughly understand how she did it , but i do n't know how she came to be the person who did it
if south park were a person , it would be old enough to vote , though it probably would n't that scabrous cartoon has been a onestop shop for antipartisan satire and blasphemy on comedy central since 1997 few comedies can stay firstrate for that long \( sorry , homer \) early in the current season , the show s 19th , the creators trey parker and matt stone seem to wonder how well the show s offendatallcosts ethos has aged it s like i'm a relic , a recurring character says sometimes i feel like i 've outstayed my welcome the character in question is a white restaurant owner who believes he is chinese and speaks in a grossly stereotyped asian accent maybe , that metalament seemed to suggest , the show had started punching down in its later years yet this fall south park has gone and revitalized itself , by telling a more ambitious , serialized story and by asserting that it takes an outrageous comedy to capture an era of outrage this season , which airs its finale on wednesday , is built around an extended satire of political correctness south park , colo , is taken over by a new school principal named , aptly , p c principal and his crew of likeminded , jackedup frat bros , who believe that being pc means you love nothing more than beer , working out and the feeling that you get when you rhetorically defend a marginalized community from systems of oppression ! they meet microaggression with macroaggression , bullying kids and adults who , say , refer to the transgender reality star caitlyn jenner as anything less than stunning and brave but the season also targeted the rise of donald j trump , a phenomenon who has thrived on a resentment of things pc , just this week crowing that his plan to ban muslims from the united states was a longtime character , mr garrison , begins a white house bid on a familiarsounding platform of xenophobia against canadians \( recurring boogeymen of south park , going back to the blame canada number from the 1999 movie musical \) canada , in turn , has elected its own trumplike figure , with disastrous results we thought it was funny , one canadian laments nobody really thought he 'd ever be president ! in reality , canada has a prime minister but south park has never cared much about political fine points so much as comedy that deflates zealots and defends the offensive , like an american charlie hebdo it was ahead of the curve in asserting a right to depict the prophet muhammad , who appeared in a 2001 episode \( though comedy central squelched later attempts \) now , it was as if our culture had been shining an eric cartmanshaped batsignal and south park answered you could see the news from college campuses safe spaces , trigger warnings and conclude that america was more radically leftist than ever you could read a dispatch from the republican primary border walls , refugee panic and conclude that it was more reactionary than ever the country is deeply polarized , and between two poles is precisely where the quasilibertarian south park most likes to swing south park used to be so anticontinuity its episodes are often written days before airing that the show would kill the same character , kenny mccormick , every week by shifting toward serial stories , mr parker and mr stone have been able to make more complex arguments this season acknowledging , for instance , that sometimes outrage culture has a basis in actual outrages an episode on police brutality posits both that south park s cops are needed to keep the peace and that many of them joined the force to have carte blanche to beat up minorities and where past south park satires once looked at single issues , this season is sketching something like a grand if messy unified theory of anger , inequality and disillusionment in 2015 america even as the pc wars rage , the town of south park is being gentrified it s attracted a whole foods and built sodosopa \( south of downtown south park \) , an enclave of hipster eateries and condos built literally around the house of the dirtpoor mccormick family the townspeople are delighted , until they realize many of them ca n't afford to join the few , the smug , the artisanal under the town s chichi new facade is a familiar slurry of resentment \( of the privileged , of immigrants , of elites \) and fear \( of terrorism , of crime , of economically falling \) and all that , in the south park worldview , drives people to a selfpitying narcissism that extends to politics but also goes beyond it in the season s darkest episode , safe space , the townspeople assign a single child to filter every negative comment from their social media , to protect their selfesteem from all manner of shaming after the boy nearly dies from the strain of filtering the entire internet s hate , an allegorical figure named reality wearing a silentmovie villain s cape and mustache shows up to scold south parkers with a lecture that sums up this season s swiftian brimstone morality i'm sorry the world is n't one big liberalarts college campus ! we eat too much we take our spoiled lives for granted feel a little bad about it sometimes affected by his words , the citizens are moved to action they take reality to the town square and hang him it s not exactly subtle , nor is the show s argument entirely focused the seasonending arc has involved a tangent about deceptive online advertising \( the finale may be more timely only a week after the terrorist shooting in san bernardino , calif , the episode promises a story on how the citizens of south park feel safer armed a teaser video has cartman getting in an armed standoff with his mother at bedtime \) and by making p c principal and friends white dudes , the show sidesteps the fact that politically correct is often a label lobbed white dudes at women and minorities who 've faced actual prejudice mr parker and mr stone anticipate this criticism too , having cartman tell his schoolmate kyle , with atypical selfawareness we 're two privileged straight white boys who have their laughs about things we never had to deal with this product of two white guys does have a different vantage point from many of today s best comedies dealing with identity issues , from blackish to master of none but in a way , its project and theirs are the same to deal with tensions by prescribing more conversation , even if it s uncomfortable , not less
marion , ala judge marvin wiggins s courtroom was packed on a september morning the docket listed hundreds of offenders who owed fines or fees for a wide variety of crimes hunting after dark , assault , drug possession and passing bad checks among them good morning , ladies and gentlemen , began judge wiggins , a circuit judge here in rural alabama since 1999 for your consideration , there s a blood drive outside , he continued , according to a recording of the hearing if you do n't have any money , go out there and give blood and bring in a receipt indicating you gave blood for those who had no money or did not want to give blood , the judge concluded the sheriff has enough handcuffs efforts by courts and local governments to generate revenue by imposing fines for minor offenses , particularly from poor and workingclass people , have attracted widespread attention and condemnation in recent months but legal and health experts said they could not think of another modern example of a court all but ordering offenders to give blood in lieu of payment , or face jail time they all agreed that it was improper what happened is wrong in about 3 , 000 ways , said arthur l caplan , a professor of medical ethics at nyu langone medical center , part of new york university you 're basically sentencing someone to an invasive procedure that does n't benefit them and is n't protecting the public health reached by phone , judge wiggins said i cannot speak with you the dozens of offenders who showed up that day , old and young , filed out of the perry county courthouse and waited their turn at a mobile blood bank parked in the street they were told to bring a receipt to the clerk showing they had given a pint of blood , and in return they would receive a 100 credit toward their fines and be allowed to go free carl crocker , who was among those who owed money to the court , recounted seeing one older man pass out after his blood was taken another defendant , traci green , said that one young man became so angry about the choice he was given that he was taken out of the courtroom james m barnes jr , a lawyer who was in the courtroom that morning , said , i thought it was really unusual i do n't know whether it s legal or not i do n't know if that violates half the constitution , he said on monday , the southern poverty law center filed an ethics complaint against judge wiggins , saying he had committed a violation of bodily integrity the group also objected to the hearing beyond the matter of blood collection , calling the entire proceeding unconstitutional paymentdue hearings like this one are part of a new initiative by alabama s struggling courts to raise money by aggressively pursuing outstanding fines , restitution , court costs and lawyer fees many of those whose payments are sought in these hearings have been found at one point to be indigent , yet their financial situations often are not considered when they are summoned for outstanding payments several people who were at the hearing on sept 17 said they were unsure whether they were being ordered to pay the entire amount due or their usual monthly payment , which many had already been paying on time , often for offenses dating back a decade or more mr green , 43 , who owes thousands of dollars in connection with two marijuanarelated convictions one from 1998 said he had offered to pay as much as he could but had been led to believe that he had to give blood anyway he told us we got to go there and give some blood or we go to jail , mr green said he said he had willingly given blood before but , like others there on that day , did not want to be compelled to do so ordering defendants to give blood used to be more commonplace , particularly during wartime , according to flesh and blood , a history of blood transfusions and organ transplantation by susan lederer , a professor of medical history now at the university of wisconsinmadison in the mid20th century , judges in several places around the country , including honolulu after the pearl harbor attack , ordered people convicted of traffic violations to give blood or offered blood donations as an alternative to a fine more commonly , prisoners would receive cash incentives or reduced sentences for giving blood \( as late as 2008 , a judge in broward county , fla , offered traffic offenders the choice of a fine , community service or a blood donation \) but fears about the spread of hepatitis led to a broad move away from compensation for blood in the 1970s and to what has become a nearly allvolunteer blood donation system while it is not illegal to pay someone for blood , the food and drug administration does require that blood collected in exchange for compensation be labeled paid , and hospitals generally refuse such blood for transfusions mr crocker , 41 , who made the recordings of judge wiggins , also recorded the employees of the mobile blood bank , who seemed fully aware of the sentencereduction arrangement mr crocker said he grew even more uncomfortable later , after he recognized the blood bank , lifesouth community blood centers , which had recently lost a 4 million judgment for an hivtainted blood transfusion it s just wrong for them to utilize people who are in the court system and essentially extort blood out of you because you owe traffic tickets , misdemeanors , felonies , whatever you 're there for , mr crocker said jill evans , a vice president for lifesouth , which is based in gainesville , fla , said the employee who set up the blood drive with the courthouse had acted improperly because the employee understood ahead of time that the judge would reduce community service obligations for those willing to donate , a violation of company policy we appreciate the judge s attempt to support the community s blood needs , ms evans said however , lifesouth prohibits blood donations from being considered as community service because it is potentially an unacceptable incentive for a volunteer donor ms evans said that after receiving a complaint , lifesouth quarantined and tested the blood , tried to contact all the donors and eventually discarded nearly all of the blood units collected the record at the county jail shows that no one was taken into custody that day the court clerk said in a brief interview that there had been no intention of jailing anyone mr crocker said this was because everyone decided that having blood taken was better than going to jail however , sara zampierin , a lawyer at the southern poverty law center , said that in the handful of instances she reviewed of people who gave blood , none had received the 100 discount they had been promised
moscow elena obraztsova , a mezzosoprano who survived the siege of leningrad to become one of the soviet union s greatest opera singers and an international star during the cold war , died on jan 12 at a clinic in germany she was 75 the cause was cardiac arrest following complications of pneumonia and an undisclosed illness , said yekaterina shikalovich , a spokeswoman for ms obraztsova s charitable music foundation ms obraztsova became such an admired favorite of the soviet cultural establishment that the authorities in moscow allowed her frequent opportunities to perform abroad as a shining representative of soviet artistic greatness she sang at la scala in milan , covent garden in london , the metropolitan opera in new york and the vienna state opera , among other stages , and was permitted to record with the conductor herbert von karajan she was given the lenin prize and named a people s artist of the ussr and a hero of socialist labor her first performances in new york were triumphant  , ' a headline in the new york times proclaimed on oct 14 , 1976 , after she made her met debut as amneris , the daughter of the king of egypt , played by philip booth calling her a major artist in a rave review , the times s music critic donal henahan said ms obraztsova had elicited a happy state of pandemonium from the met audience with a flesh and blood performance that made the other principals in this aida' seem mummified by contrast at the time , ms obraztsova was the leading mezzosoprano for the bolshoi opera and had made her new york debut with the company to much acclaim the previous season her grandest moments at the bolshoi included performances as the countess in tchaikovsky s the queen of spades and lyubasha in rimskykorsakov s the tsar s bride and unusual for an officially approved soviet star complained publicly in 1981 about a dearth of new productions at the bolshoi at the time , it offered only one opera by mozart , one by wagner and none by bellini or donizetti the bolshoi shows the same list of operas every year , ms obraztsova told literaturnaya gazeta , implying that that was the reason she spent so much time performing abroad i cannot appear in queen of spades' and tsar s bride' forever she also had sharp words for the celebrated soviet soprano galina vishnevskaya in a longrunning public feud rife with musical rivalry and political overtones in her memoirs and in interviews , ms vishnevskaya accused ms obraztsova of denouncing her and the great cellist mstislav rostropovich when they were under attack by the soviet authorities for protecting , the nobel laureate and critic of totalitarianism ms obraztsova denied the accusation indeed , she , too , could be stymied by the soviet system , she said in a 2011 interview , ms obraztsova spoke of her friendship with rudolf nureyev , who defected to the west in 1961 , and her unsuccessful attempt to persuade the authorities to let his mother leave the country for surgery she recalled their conversation , after he had left russia you , ' he said to me , are so great in russia , everyone loves you go and ask them to let my mother come here , have surgery , and then she 'll go back to ufa' i went to the kgb can you imagine \? some general met me , and i spent a long time explaining to him that the mother is not to blame that her boy left , and that it s necessary to let her go for a short time this guy kept holding back , holding back , and then said you know , elena vasilyevna , i suggest you do your job and sing , and we 'll take care of the rest i hope we do n't meet again' elena vasilyevna obraztsova was born in leningrad on july 7 , 1939 , less than two months before the outbreak of while her father was serving at the front , she and her mother survived through much of the germans' crushing 900day siege of leningrad before they were evacuated yes , there was great suffering , and even as a child i knew that things were bad , she told the times during her 1976 visit to new york sometimes young children do n't know how bad things are , but i knew yet i believe that when we suffer , we learn better how to love in the 1950s , her father s job took the family to southern russia , to taganrog , then to rostovondon , where ms obraztsova began serious musical studies she won gold medals in voice competitions in helsinki and moscow in 1962 and was still a student at the rimskykorsakov conservatory in leningrad when , the next year , she made her bolshoi debut as marina mnishek in mussorgsky s boris godunov she joined the bolshoi as a soloist in 1964 and , rare for a newcomer , was immediately allowed to accompany the troupe on tours of japan and italy , where she sang at la scala for many years ms obraztsova had a close creative association with georgy sviridov , a neoromantic composer who also found fame within the soviet cultural system and whose works she often performed in concert her talents were captured for the screen by franco zeffirelli , who directed her , opposite pl cido domingo , in a in 1978 and again in 1982 in a film version of mascagni s  ms obraztsova also taught , from 1973 to 1994 , at the moscow conservatory , and more recently in tokyo and st petersburg from 2007 to 2008 she was the artistic director of the opera troupe at the mikhailovsky theater in st petersburg , and in 2011 she created a charitable foundation to promote music education she left her first husband , vyacheslav makarov , a physicist , for algis zhuraitis , a conductor at the bolshoi , who died in 1998 she is survived by a daughter , elena , and two grandchildren in 2005 , the newspaper kultura asked ms obraztsova if she used to have to hide her christian beliefs in officially atheist soviet society i did n't hide anything , she said i went to church and wore a cross and i made the sign of the cross before going on stage they would get mad at me , of course , but so what \?

been coopted by it , and also has a proven record of accomplishing different things i have a record of working across the political aisle i 've also spent more than half of my professional life away

martin o'malley , former mayor of baltimore , former governor of maryland , a life long democrat , and most importantly , a husband , and a father my wife katie and i have four great kids , grace , and tara , and william and jack and , like you , there is nothing we would n't do to give them healthier and better lives there are some things that i have learned to do better in life than others and , after 15 years of executive experience , i have learned how to be an effective leader whether it was raising the minimum wage , making our public schools the best in america , passing marriage equality , the dream act , and comprehensive gun safety legislation , i have learned how to get things done because i am very clear about my principals thanks to president obama , our country has come a long way since the wall street crash of 2008 our country s doing better , we are creating jobs again but we elected a president , not a magician , and there is urgent work that needs to be done right now for there is a deep injustice , an economic injustice that threatens to tear our country apart , and it will not solve itself injustice does not solve itself what i'm talking about is this , our middle class is shrinking our poor families are becoming poorer , and 70 percent of us are earning the same , or less than we were 12 years ago we need new leadership , and we need action the sort of action that will actually make wages go up again for all american families our economy is n't money , it s people it s all of our people , and so we must invest in our country , and the potential of our kids to make college a debt free option for all of our families , instead of settling our kids with a lifetime of crushing debt and , we must square our shoulders to the great challenge of climate change and make this threat our opportunity the future is what we make of it we are all in this together and , the question in this election is whether you and i still have the ability to give our kids a better future i believe we do , that is why i am running for president , and i need your help thank you \( applause \) governor o'malley , thank you very much senator sanders anderson , thank you very much i think most americans understand that our country today faces a series of unprecedented crises the middle class of this country for the last 40 years has been disappearing millions of americans are working longer hours for lower wages , and yet almost all of the new income and wealth being created is going to the top one percent as a result of this disastrous citizens united supreme court decision , our campaign finance system is corrupt and is undermining american democracy millionaires and billionaires are pouring unbelievable sums of money into the political process in order to fund super pacs and to elect candidates who represent their interests , not the interests of working people today , the scientific community is virtually unanimous climate change is real , it is caused by human activity , and we have a moral responsibility to transform our energy system away from fossil fuel to energy efficiency and sustainable energy and leave this planet a habitable planet for our children and our grandchildren today in america , we have more people in jail than any other country on earth africanamerican youth unemployment is 51 percent hispanic youth unemployment is 36 percent it seems to me that instead of building more jails and providing more incarceration , maybe just maybe we should be putting money into education and jobs for our kids \( applause \) what this campaign is about is whether we can mobilize our people to take back our government from a handful of billionaires and create the vibrant democracy we know we can and should have thank you \( applause \) secretary clinton \? well , thank you , and thanks to everyone for hosting this first of the democratic debates i'm hillary clinton i have been proud and privileged to serve as first lady , as a senator from new york , and as secretary of state i'm the granddaughter of a factory worker and the grandmother of a wonderful oneyearold child and every day , i think about what we need to do to make sure that opportunity is available not just for her , but for all of our children i have spent a very long time my entire adult life looking for ways to even the odds to help people have a chance to get ahead , and , in particular , to find the ways for each child to live up to his or her godgiven potential i 've traveled across our country over the last months listening and learning , and i 've put forward specific plans about how we 're going to create more goodpaying jobs by investing in infrastructure and clean energy , by making it possible once again to invest in science and research , and taking the opportunity posed by climate change to grow our economy at the center of my campaign is how we 're going to raise wages yes , of course , raise the minimum wage , but we have to do so much more , including finding ways so that companies share profits with the workers who helped to make them and then we have to figure out how we 're going to make the tax system a fairer one right now , the wealthy pay too little and the middle class pays too much so i have specific recommendations about how we 're going to close those loopholes , make it clear that the wealthy will have to pay their fair share , and have a series of tax cuts for middleclass families and i want to do more to help us balance family and work i believe in equal pay for equal work for women , but i also believe it s about time we had paid family leave for american families and join the rest of the world \( applause \) during the course of the evening tonight , i 'll have a chance to lay out all of my plans and the work that i 've done behind them but for me , this is about bringing our country together again and i will do everything i can to heal the divides the divides economically , because there s too much inequality the racial divides the continuing discrimination against the lgbt community so that we work together and , yes , finally , fathers will be able to say to their daughters , you , too , can grow up to be president \( applause \) thank you , all it is time to start the debate are you all ready \? \( applause \) all right let s begin we 're going to be discussing a lot of the issues , many of the issues , important issues that you have brought up but i want to begin with concerns that voters have about each of the candidates here on this stage that they have about each of you secretary clinton , i want to start with you plenty of politicians evolve on issues , but even some democrats believe you change your positions based on political expediency you were against samesex marriage now you 're for it you defended president obama s immigration policies now you say they 're too harsh you supported his trade deal dozen of times you even called it the gold standard now , suddenly , last week , you 're against it will you say anything to get elected \? well , actually , i have been very consistent over the course of my entire life , i have always fought for the same values and principles , but , like most human beings including those of us who run for office i do absorb new information i do look at what s happening in the world you know , taker the trade deal i did say , when i was secretary of state , three years ago , that i hoped it would be the gold standard it was just finally negotiated last week , and in looking at it , it did n't meet my standards my standards for more new , good jobs for americans , for raising wages for americans and i want to make sure that i can look into the eyes of any middleclass american and say , this will help raise your wages and i concluded i could not secretary clinton , though , with all due respect , the question is really about political expediency just in july , new hampshire , you told the crowd you 'd , quote , take a back seat to no one when it comes to progressive values last month in ohio , you said you plead guilty to , quote , being kind of moderate and center do you change your political identity based on who you 're talking to \? clinton no i think that , like most people that i know , i have a range of views , but they are rooted in my values and my experience and i do n't take a back seat to anyone when it comes to progressive experience and progressive commitment you know , when i left law school , my first job was with the children s defense fund , and for all the years since , i have been focused on how we 're going to unstack the deck , and how we 're gonna make it possible for more people to have the experience i had you know , to be able to come from a grandfather who was a factory worker , a father who was a small business person , and now asking the people of america to elect me president just for the record , are you a progressive , or are you a moderate \? i'm a progressive but i'm a progressive who likes to get things done and i know \( applause \) how to find common ground , and i know how to stand my ground , and i have proved that in every position that i 've had , even dealing with republicans who never had a good word to say about me , honestly but we found ways to work together on everything from secretary reforming foster care and adoption to the children s health insurance program , which insures thank you 8 million kids so i have a long history of getting things done , rooted in the same values senator i 've always had senator sanders a gallup poll says half the country would not put a socialist in the white house you call yourself a democratic socialist how can any kind of socialist win a general election in the united states \? well , we 're gonna win because first , we 're gonna explain what democratic socialism is and what democratic socialism is about is saying that it is immoral and wrong that the top onetenth of 1 percent in this country own almost 90 percent almost own almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent that it is wrong , today , in a rigged economy , that 57 percent of all new income is going to the top 1 percent that when you look around the world , you see every other major country providing health care to all people as a right , except the united states you see every other major country saying to moms that , when you have a baby , we 're not gonna separate you from your newborn baby , because we are going to have we are gonna have medical and family paid leave , like every other country on earth those are some of the principles that i believe in , and i think we should look to countries like denmark , like sweden and norway , and learn from what they have accomplished for their working people \( applause \) denmark is a country that has a population denmark is a country that has a population of 56 million people the question is really about electability here , and that s what i'm trying to get at you the the republican attack ad against you in a general election it writes itself you supported the sandinistas in nicaragua you honeymooned in the soviet union and just this weekend , you said you 're not a capitalist does n't does n't that ad write itself \? well , first of all , let s look at the facts the facts that are very simple republicans win when there is a low voter turnout , and that is what happened last november sixtythree percent of the american people did n't vote , anderson eighty percent of young people did n't vote we are bringing out huge turnouts , and creating excitement all over this country democrats at the white house on down will win , when there is excitement and a large voter turnout , and that is what this campaign is doing you do n't consider yourself a capitalist , though \? do i consider myself part of the casino capitalist process by which so few have so much and so many have so little by which wall street s greed and recklessness wrecked this economy \? no , i do n't i believe in a society where all people do well not just a handful of billionaires \( applause \) just let me just be clear is there anybody else on the stage who is not a capitalist \? well , let me just followup on that , anderson , because when i think about capitalism , i think about all the small businesses that were started because we have the opportunity and the freedom in our country for people to do that and to make a good living for themselves and their families and i do n't think we should confuse what we have to do every so often in america , which is save capitalism from itself and i think what senator sanders is saying certainly makes sense in the terms of the inequality that we have but we are not denmark i love denmark we are the united states of america and it s our job to rein in the excesses of capitalism so that it does n't run amok and does n't cause the kind of inequities we 're seeing in our economic system but we would be making a grave mistake to turn our backs on what built the greatest middle class in the history senator sanders \? of the world \( applause \) i think everybody is in agreement that we are a great entrepreneurial nation we have got to encourage that of course , we have to support small and mediumsized businesses but you can have all of the growth that you want and it does n't mean anything if all of the new income and wealth is going to the top 1 percent so what we need to do is support small and mediumsized businesses , the backbone of our economy , but we have to make sure that every family in this country gets a fair shake we 're going to get not just for billionaires we 're going to have a lot more on these issues but i do want to just quickly get everybody in on the question of electability governor chafee , you 've been everything but a socialist when you were senator from rhode island , you were a republican when you were elected governor , you were an independent you 've only been a democrat for little more than two years why should democratic voters trust you wo n't change again \? anderson , you 're looking at a block of granite when it comes to the issues whether it s \( crosstalk \) it seems like pretty soft granite i mean , you 've been a republican , you 've been an independent did you hear what i said \? on the issues i have not changed on the issues i was a liberal republican , then i was an independent , and now i'm a proud democrat but i have not changed on the issues and i open my record to scrutiny whether it s on the environment , a woman s right to choose , gay marriage , fiscal responsibility , aversion to foreign entanglements , using the tools of government to help the less fortunate time and time again , i have never changed you 're looking at a block of granite when it comes to the issues so i have not changed then why change labels \? the party left me there s no doubt about that there was no room for a liberal moderate republican in that party i even had a primary for my reelection in 2006 i won it but the money poured in to defeat me in rhode island as a republican that s what we were up against governor o'malley , the concern of voters about you is that you tout our record as baltimore s mayor as we all know , we all saw it that city exploded in riots and violence in april the current top prosecutor in baltimore , also a democrat , blames your zero tolerance policies for sowing the seeds of unrest why should americans trust you with the country when they see what s going on in the city that you ran for more than seven years \? yes , actually , i believe what she said was that there s a lot of policies that have led to this unrest but , anderson , when i ran for mayor of baltimore in 1999 she actually just for the record , when she was asked which policies , to name two , she said zero tolerance i mean , there s a number of old policies that we 're seeing the results of that distress of communities , where communities do n't want to step forward and say who killed a 3yearold , it s a direct result of these failed policies well , let s talk about this a little bit one of the things that was not reported during that heartbreaking night of unrest in baltimore was that arrests had actually fallen to a 38year low in the year prior to the freddie gray s tragic death anderson , when i ran for mayor of baltimore back in 1999 , it was not because our city was doing well it was because we allowed ourselves to become the most violent , addicted , and abandoned city in america and i ran and promised people that together we could turn that around and we put our city on a path to reduce violent crime , or part one \( ph \) crime by more than any other major city in america over the next 10 years i did not make our city immune to setbacks but i attended a lot of funerals , including one for a family of seven who were firebombed in their sleep for picking up the phone in a poor africanamerican neighborhood and calling the police because of drug dealers on their corner we 've saved over a thousand lives in baltimore in the last 15 years of people working together and the vast majority of them were young and poor and black it was n't easy on any day but we saved lives and we gave our city a better future , improving police and community relations every single day that i was in office in one year alone , though , 100 , 000 arrests were made in your city , a city of 640 , 000 people the aclu , the naacp sued you , sued the city , and the city actually settled , saying a lot of those arrests were without probable cause well , i think the key word in your followup there was the word settle that s true it was settled arrests peaked in 2003 , anderson , but they declined every year after that as we restored peace in our poorer neighborhoods so that people could actually walk and not have to worry about their kids or their loved ones of being victims of violent crime look , none of this is easy none of us has all the answers but together as a city , we saved a lot of lives it was about leadership it was about principle and it was about bringing people together thank you , governor thank you cooper senator webb , in 2006 , you called affirmative action statesponsored racism in 2010 , you wrote an op ed saying it discriminates against whites given that nearly half the democratic party is nonwhite , are n't you out of step with where the democratic party is now \? no , actually i believe that i am where the democratic party traditionally has been the democratic party , and the reason i 've decided to run as a democrat , has been the party that gives people who otherwise have no voice in the corridors of power a voice and that is not determined by race and as a clarification , i have always supported affirmative action for african americans that s the way the program was originally designed because of their unique history in this country , with slavery and the jim crow laws that followed what i have discussed a number of times is the idea that when we create diversity programs that include everyone , quote , of color , other than whites , struggling whites like the families in the appalachian mountains , we 're not being true to the democratic party principle of elevating the level of consciousness among our people about the hardships that a lot of people who happen to be have by culture , by the way senator webb , thank you very much let s move on to some of the most pressing issues facing our country right now , some of the biggest issues right now in the headlines today we 're going to start with guns the shooting in oregon earlier this month , once again it brought the issue of guns into the national conversation over the last week , guns have been the most discussed political topic on facebook by two to one senator sanders , you voted against the brady bill that mandated background checks and a waiting period you also supported allowing riders to bring guns in checked bags on amtrak trains for a decade , you said that holding gun manufacturers legally responsible for mass shootings is a bad idea now , you say you 're reconsidering that which is it shield the gun companies from lawsuits or not \? let s begin , anderson , by understanding that bernie sanders has a dminus voting rating \( ph \) from the nra let s also understand that back in 1988 when i first ran for the united states congress , way back then , i told the gun owners of the state of vermont and i told the people of the state of vermont , a state which has virtually no gun control , that i supported a ban on assault weapons and over the years , i have strongly avoided instant background checks , doing away with this terrible gun show loophole and i think we 've got to move aggressively at the federal level in dealing with the straw man purchasers also i believe , and i 've fought for , to understand that there are thousands of people in this country today who are suicidal , who are homicidal , but ca n't get the healthcare that they need , the mental healthcare , because they do n't have insurance or they 're too poor i believe that everybody in this country who has a mental crisis has got to get mental health counseling immediately cooper do you want to shield gun companies from lawsuits \? of course not this was a large and complicated bill there were provisions in it that i think made sense for example , do i think that a gun shop in the state of vermont that sells legally a gun to somebody , and that somebody goes out and does something crazy , that that gun shop owner should be held responsible \? i do n't on the other hand , where you have manufacturers and where you have gun shops knowingly giving guns to criminals or aiding and abetting that , of course we should take action secretary clinton , is bernie sanders tough enough on guns \? no , not at all i think that we have to look at the fact that we lose 90 people a day from gun violence this has gone on too long and it s time the entire country stood up against the nra the majority of our country \( applause \) supports background checks , and even the majority of gun owners do senator sanders did vote five times against the brady bill since it was passed , more than 2 million prohibited purchases have been prevented he also did vote , as he said , for this immunity provision i voted against it i was in the senate at the same time it was n't that complicated to me it was pretty straightforward to me that he was going to give immunity to the only industry in america everybody else has to be accountable , but not the gun manufacturers and we need to stand up and say enough of that we 're not going to let it continue \( applause \) we 're going to bring you all in on this but , senator sanders , you have to give a response as a senator from a rural state , what i can tell secretary clinton , that all the shouting in the world is not going to do what i would hope all of us want , and that is keep guns out of the hands of people who should not have those guns and end this horrible violence that we are seeing i believe that there is a consensus in this country a consensus has said we need to strengthen and expand instant background checks , do away with this gun show loophole , that we have to address the issue of mental health , that we have to deal with the strawman purchasing issue , and that when we develop that consensus , we can finally , finally do something to address this issue governor o'malley , you passed gun legislation as governor of maryland , but you had a democraticcontrolled legislature president obama could n't convince congress to pass gun legislation after the massacres in aurora , in newtown , and charleston how can you \? and , anderson , i also had to overcome a lot of opposition in the leadership of my own party to get this done look , it s fine to talk about all of these things and i'm glad we 're talking about these things but i 've actually done them we passed comprehensive gun safety legislation , not by looking at the pollings or looking at what the polls said we actually did it and , anderson , here tonight in our audience are two people that make this issue very , very real sandy and lonnie phillips are here from colorado and their daughter , jessie , was one of those who lost their lives in that awful mass shooting in aurora now , to try to transform their grief , they went to court , where sometimes progress does happen when you file in court , but in this case , you want to talk about a a rigged game , senator \? the game was rigged a man had sold 4 , 000 rounds of military ammunition to this this person that killed their daughter , riddled her body with five bullets , and he did n't even ask where it was going and not only did their case get thrown out of court , they were slapped with 200 , 000 in court fees because of the way that the nra gets its way in our congress and we take a backseat it s time to stand up and pass comprehensive gun safety legislation as a nation \( applause \) senator sanders , i want you to be able to respond , 30 seconds i think the governor gave a very good example about the weaknesses in that law and i think we have to take another look at it but here is the point , governor we can raise our voices , but i come from a rural state , and the views on gun control in rural states are different than in urban states , whether we like it or not our job is to bring people together around strong , commonsense gun legislation i think there is a vast majority in this country who want to do the right thing , and i intend to lead the country in bringing our people together senator senator , excuse me \( crosstalk \) senator , it is not about rural senator , it was not about rural and urban it s exactly about rural have you ever been to the eastern shore \? have you ever been to western maryland \? we were able to pass this and still respect the hunting traditions of people who live in our rural areas governor and we did it by leading with principle , not by pandering to the nra and backing down to the nra well , as somebody who has a dminus voting record \( crosstalk \) and i have an f from the nra , senator i do n't think i am pandering but you have not been in the united states congress well , maybe that s a healthy thing \( laughter \) and when you want to , check it out and if you think if you think that we can simply go forward and pass something tomorrow without bringing people together , you are sorely mistaken let me bring in somebody who has a different viewpoint senator webb , your rating from the nra , you once had an a rating from the nra you 've said gun violence goes down when more people are allowed to carry guns would encouraging more people to be armed be part of your response to a mass shooting \? look , there are two fundamental issues that are involved in this discussion we need to pay respect to both of them the first is the issue of who should be kept from having guns and using firearms and we have done not a good job on that a lot of them are criminals and a lot of the people are getting killed are members of gangs inside our urban areas and a lot of them are mentally incapacitated and the shooting in virginia tech in '07 , this individual had received medical care for mental illness from three different professionals who were not allowed to share the information so we do need background checks we need to keep the people who should not have guns away from them but we have to respect the tradition in this country of people who want to defend themselves and their family from violence senator may i \? people are going back and forth here for 10 minutes here there are people at high levels in this government who have bodyguards 24 hours a day , seven days a week the average american does not have that , and deserves the right to be able to protect their family senator governor chafee , you have an f rating from the nra , what do you think about what senator webb just said \? yes , i have a good record of voting for gun commonsense safety legislation , but the reality is , despite these tragedies that happen time and time again , when legislators step up to pass commonsense gun safety legislation , the gun lobby moves in and tells the people they 're coming to take away your guns and , they 're successful at it , in colorado and others states , the legislators that vote for commonsense gun safety measures then get defeated i even saw in rhode island so , i would bring the gun lobby in and say we 've got to change this where can we find common ground \? wayne lapierre from the nra , whoever it is , the leaders come one , we 've go to change this we 're not coming to take away your guns , we believe in the second amendment , but let s find common ground here i want to anderson , when the nra wrote to everyone in our state when the nra wrote to members in our state and told people with hunting traditions lies about what our comprehensive gun safety legislation is , i wrote right back to them and laid out what it actually did and that s why , not only did we pass it , but the nra did n't excuse me dare to petition a referendum i want to make because we built a public consensus i want to move on to another issue , which is in the headlines right now , another crisis making headlines secretary clinton , russia , they 're challenging the us in syria according to us intelligence , they 've lied about who they 're bombing you spearheaded the reset with russia did you underestimate the russians , and as president , what would your response to vladimir putin be right now in syria \? well , first of all , we got a lot of business done with the russians when medvedev was the president , and not putin we got a nuclear arms deal , we got the iranian sanctions , we got an ability to bring important material and equipment to our soldiers in afghanistan there s no doubt that when putin came back in and said he was going to be president , that did change the relationship we have to stand up to his bullying , and specifically in syria , it is important and i applaud the administration because they are engaged in talks right now with the russians to make it clear that they 've got to be part of the solution to try to end that bloody conflict and , to provide safe zones so that people are not going to have to be flooding out of syria at the rate they are and , i think it s important too that the united states make it very clear to putin that it s not acceptable for him to be in syria creating more chaos , bombing people on behalf of assad , and we ca n't do that if we do n't take more of a leadership position , which is what i'm advocating senator sanders , what would you do differently well , let s understand that when we talk about syria , you 're talking about a quagmire in a quagmire you 're talking about groups of people trying to overthrow assad , other groups of people fighting isis you 're talking about people who are fighting isis using their guns to overthrow assad , and vice versa i'm the former chairman of the senate veterans committee , and in that capacity i learned a very powerful lesson about the cost of war , and i will do everything that i can to make sure that the united states does not get involved in another quagmire like we did in iraq , the worst foreign policy blunder in the history of this country we should be putting together a coalition of arab countries who should be leading the effort we should be supportive , but i do not support american ground troops in syria on this issue of foreign policy , i want to go to well , nobody does nobody does , senator sanders i want to go to dana bash dana \? governor chafee , you were the only republican in the senate to vote against the iraq war you say secretary clinton should be disqualified from the presidency because she voted in favor of using force in iraq she has since said that her vote was a mistake why is n't that good enough \? chafee well , we just heard senator sanders say that it s the worst decision in american history that s very significant , the worst decision in american history , i just heard from senator sanders so , as we look ahead , if you 're going to make those poor judgment calls , a critical time in our history , we just finished with the vietnam era , getting back into another quagmire if you 're looking ahead , and you 're looking at someone who made that poor decision in 2002 to go into iraq when there was no real evidence of weapons of mass destruction in iraq i know because i did my homework , and , so , that s an indication of how someone will perform in the future and that s what s important \( applause \) secretary clinton , he s questioning your judgment well , i recall very well being on a debate stage , i think , about 25 times with then senator obama , debating this very issue after the election , he asked me to become secretary of state he valued my judgment , and i spent a lot of time with him \( applause \) in the situation room , going over some very difficult issues you know , i i agree completely we do n't want american troops on the ground in syria i never said that what i said was we had to put together a coalition in fact , something that i worked on before i left the state department to do , and yes , that it should include arabs , people in the region because what i worry about is what will happen with isis gaining more territory , having more reach , and , frankly , posing a threat to our friends and neighbors in the region and far beyond so i think while you 're talking about the tough decision that president obama had to make about osama bin laden , where i was one of his few advisers , or putting together that coalition to impose sanctions on iran i think i have a lot of evidence \( crosstalk \) senator sanders senator sanders , i want to bring you in here my question for you is , as a congressman , you voted against the iraq war you voted against the gulf war you 're just talking about syria , but under what circumstances would a president sanders actually use force \? let me just respond to something the secretary said first of all , she is talking about , as i understand it , a nofly zone in syria , which i think is a very dangerous situation could lead to real problems second of all , i heard the same evidence from president bush and dick cheney and don rumsfeld about why we should overthrow saddam hussein and get involved in the i would urge people to go to berniesanderscom , hear what i said in 2002 and i say , without any joy in my heart , that much of what i thought would happen about the destabilization , in fact , did happen so i think all right \( applause \) i think the president is trying very hard to thread a tough needle here , and that is to support those people who are against assad , against isis , without getting us on the ground there , and that s the direction i believe we should have \( inaudible \) but , senator sanders , you did n't answer the question under what under what circumstances would you actually use force \? well , obviously , i voted , when president clinton said , let s stop ethnic cleansing in kosovo , i voted for that i voted to make sure that osama bin laden was held accountable in afghanistan when our country is threatened , or when our allies are threatened , i believe that we need coalitions to come together to address the major crises of this country i do not support the united states getting involved in unilateral action you 're at work with our allies \( crosstalk \) i'm gonna bring you all in on this governor governor o'malley , secretary clinton i do n't believe that any \( crosstalk \) secretary clinton voted to authorize military force in iraq , supported more troops in afghanistan as secretary of state , she wanted to arm syrian rebels and push for the bombing of libya is she too quick to use military force \? anderson , no president no commander in chief should take the military option off the table , even if most of us would agree that it should be the last option what disturbed people so much about and i would agree with senator sanders on this leading us into iraq under false pretenses and telling us , as a people , that there were weapons of mass destruction there was was one of the worst blunders in modern american history but the reason why people remain angry about it is because people feel like a lot of our legislators got railroaded in a war fever and by polls and i remember being at a dinner shortly before that invasion people were talking at and saying , it 'll take us just a couple years to rebuild democracy , and i thought , has this world gone mad \? whenever we go and contrary to john quincy adams' advice searching the world for monsters to destroy , and when we use political might to take a at the expense of democratic principle , we hurt ourselves , and we hurt our \( inaudible \) does she does she want to use military force too rapidly \? i believe that , as president , i would not be so quick to pull for a military tool i believe that a nofly zone in syria , at this time , actually , secretary , would be a mistake you have to enforce nofly zones , and i believe , especially with the russian air force in the air , it could lead to an escalation because of an accident that we would deeply regret i support president obama i think we have to play a long game , and i think , ultimately you want to talk about blunders \? i think assad s invasion of syria will be seen as a blunder governor o'malley , just for the record , on the campaign trail , you 've been saying that secretary clinton is always quick for the for the military intervention senator secretary clinton , you can respond well , first of all , i anderson , can i come into this discussion at some point \? well yes , you 'll be coming in next , but she was directly quoted , senator thank you i 've been standing over here for about ten minutes , trying ok it s just it s gone back and forth over there secretary \? well , i am in the middle , here , and \( laughter \) lots of things coming from all directions you got the lucky \( inaudible \) you know , i have to say , i was very pleased when governor o'malley endorsed me for president in 2008 , and i enjoyed his strong support in that campaign and i consider him , obviously , a friend let me say because there s a lot of loose talk going on here we are already flying in syria just as we are flying in iraq the president has made a very tough decision what i believe and why i have advocated that the nofly zone which of course would be in a coalition be put on the table is because i'm trying to figure out what leverage we have to get russia to the table you know , diplomacy is not about getting to the perfect solution it s about how you balance the risks thank you and i think we have an opportunity here and i know that inside the administration this is being hotly debated to get that leverage to try to get the russians to have to deal with everybody in the region and begin to move toward a political , diplomatic solution in syria thank you , secretary \( crosstalk \) senator webb , you said as president you would never have used military force in libya and that the attack on the us consulate in benghazi was , in your words , inevitable should secretary clinton have seen that attack coming \? look , let s start i 've been trying to get in this conversation for about 10 minutes let s start with why russia is in syria right now there are three strategic failings that have allowed this to occur the first was the invasion of iraq , which destabilized ethnic elements in iraq and empowered iran the second was the arab spring , which created huge vacuums in libya and in syria that allowed terrorist movements to move in there and the third was the recent deal allowing iran to move forward and eventually acquire a nuclear weapon , which sent bad signals , bad body language into the region about whether we are acquiescing in iran becoming a stronger piece of the formula in that part of the world now , i say this as someone who spent five years in the pentagon and who opposed the war in iraq , whose son fought in iraq , i 've fought in vietnam but if you want a place where we need to be in terms of our national strategy , a focus , the greatest strategic threat that we have right now is resolving our relationship with china and we need to do this because of their aggression in the region we need to do it because of the way they treat their own people senator and i would say this i 've been waiting for 10 minutes i will say this you 're over your time as of now i will well , you 've let a lot of people go over their time i would say this you agreed to these debate rules to the unelected , authoritarian government of china you do not own the south china sea you do not have the right to conduct cyber warfare against tens of millions of american citizens and in a webb administration , we will do something about that senator sanders , i want you to be able to respond sanders pardon me \? i 'd like you to be able to respond and get in on this well , i think mr putin is going to regret what he is doing i think that when he gets into that he does n't seem to be the type of guy to regret a lot well , i think he s already regretting what he did in crimea and what he is doing in the ukraine i think he is really regretting the decline of his economy and i think what he is trying to do now is save some face but i think when russians get killed in syria and when he gets bogged down , i think the russian people are going to give him a message that maybe they should come home , maybe they should start working with the united states to rectify the situation now secretary clinton , on the campaign trail , governor webb has said that he would never have used military force in libya and that the attack on the us consulate in benghazi was inevitable should you have seen that attack coming \? well , let s remember what was going on we had a murderous dictator , gadhafi , who had american blood on his hands , as i'm sure you remember , threatening to massacre large numbers of the libyan people we had our closest allies in europe burning up the phone lines begging us to help them try to prevent what they saw as a mass genocide , in their words and we had the arabs standing by our side saying , we want you to help us deal with gadhafi our response , which i think was smart power at its best , is that the united states will not lead this we will provide essential , unique capabilities that we have , but the europeans and the arabs had to be first over the line we did not put one single american soldier on the ground in libya and i 'll say this for the libyan people but american citizens did lose their lives in benghazi but let i 'll get to that but i think it s important , since i understand senator webb s very strong feelings about this , to explain where we were then and to point out that i think president obama made the right decision at the time and the libyan people had a free election the first time since 1951 and you know what , they voted for moderates , they voted with the hope of democracy because of the arab spring , because of a lot of other things , there was turmoil to be followed but unless you believe the united states should not send diplomats to any place that is dangerous , which i do not , then when we send them forth , there is always the potential for danger and risk governor o'malley \? can i \( crosstalk \) anderson , i think we are learning \( crosstalk \) anderson , i think there s lessons to be learned from benghazi and those lessons are that we need to do a much better job as a nation of having human intelligence on the ground so that we know who the emerging next generation leaders are that are coming up to replace a dictator when his time on this planet ends and i believe that s what chris stevens was trying to do but he did not have the tools we have failed as a country to invest in the human intelligence that would allow us to make not only better decisions in libya , but better decisions in syria today and it s a huge national security failing senator webb , i want you to be able to respond thank you \( crosstalk \) senator webb \? webb this is not about benghazi per se to me it is the inevitability of something like benghazi occurring in the way that we intervened in libya we had no treaties at risk we had no americans at risk there was no threat of attack or imminent attack there is plenty of time for a president to come to the congress and request authority to use military force in that situation i called for it on the senate floor again and again i called for it in senate hearings it is not a wise thing to do and if people think it was a wise thing to do , try to get to the tripoli airport today you ca n't do it secretary \( sic \) webb , you served in vietnam you 're a marine once a marine , always a marine you served as a marine in vietnam you 're a decorated war hero you eventually became secretary of the navy during the vietnam war , the man standing next to you , senator sanders , applied for status as a conscientious objector given his history , can he serve as a credible commanderinchief \? everybody makes their decisions when the time there is conscription and as long as they go through the legal process that our country requires , i respect that and it would be for the voters to decide whether senator sanders or anyone else should be president i will say this , coming from the position that i 've come from , from a military family , with my brother a marine , my son was a marine in iraq , i served as a marine , spending five years in the pentagon , i am comfortable that i am the most qualified person standing up here today to be your commanderinchief senator sanders , tell an american soldier who is watching right now tonight in afghanistan why you can be commanderin chief given that you applied for conscientious objector status well , first of all , let me applaud my good friend jim webb for his service to this country in so many ways \( applause \) jim and i , under jim s leadership , as he indicated , passed the most significant veterans education bill in recent history we followed suit with a few years later passing , under my leadership , the most significant veterans' health care legislation in the modern history of this country \( applause \) when i was a young man i'm not a young man today when i was a young man , i strongly opposed the war in vietnam not the brave men like jim who fought in that war , but the policy which got us involved in that war that was my view then \( cheering and applause \) i am not a pacifist , anderson i supported the war in afghanistan i supported president clinton s effort to deal with ethnic cleansing in kosovo i support air strikes in syria and what the president is trying to do yes , i happen to believe from the bottom of my heart that war should be the last resort that we have got to exercise diplomacy but yes , i am prepared to take this country into war if that is necessary \( crosstalk \) very quickly , 30 seconds for each of you governor chafee , who or what is the greatest national security threat to the united states \? i want to go down the line ok i just have to answer one thing that senator webb said about the iran deal , because i'm a strong proponent of what president obama and he said that because of that the iran deal that enabled russia to come in no , that s not true , senator webb i respect your foreign policy chops but russia is aligned with iran and with assad and the alawite shias in syria so that iran deal did not allow russia to come in ok senator , i can give you 30 seconds to respond i believe that the signal that we sent to the region when the iran nuclear deal was concluded was that we are accepting iran s greater position on this very important balance of power , among our greatest ally israel , and the sunnis represented by the saudi regime , and iran it was a position of weakness and i think it encouraged the acts that we 've seen in the past several weeks thirty seconds for each of you governor chafee , what is the greatest national security threat to the united states \? it s certainly the chaos in the middle east there s no doubt about it ok and it all started with the iraq invasion governor o'malley \? i believe that nuclear iran remains the biggest threat , along with the threat of isil climate change , of course , makes cascading threats even more \( inaudible \) secretary clinton , the greatest national security threat \? i i think it has to be continued threat from the spread of nuclear weapons , nuclear material that can fall into the wrong hands i know the terrorists are constantly seeking it , and that s why we have to stay vigilant , but also united around the world to prevent that senator sanders , greatest national security threat \? the scientific community is telling us that if we do not address the global crisis of climate change , transform our energy system away from fossil fuel to sustainable energy , the planet that we 're going to be leaving our kids and our grandchildren may well not be habitable that is a major crisis senator webb \? our greatest longterm strategic challenge is our relation with china our greatest daytoday threat is cyber warfare against this country our greatest militaryoperational threat is resolving the situations in the middle east all right we 're going to take a short break do these candidates see eye to eye on an issue that is driving a big wedge between republicans \? that is next we 'll be right back \( applause \) \( commercial break \) and welcome back we are live in nevada , in las vegas , at the wynn resort for the first democratic presidential debate the questions continue we begin with secretary clinton secretary clinton , you are going to be testifying before congress next week about your emails for the last eight months , you have n't been able to put this issue behind you you dismissed it you joked about it you called it a mistake what does that say about your ability to handle far more challenging crises as president \? well , i 've taken responsibility for it i did say it was a mistake what i did was allowed by the state department , but it was n't the best choice and i have been as transparent as i know to be , turning over 55 , 000 pages of my emails , asking that they be made public and you 're right i am going to be testifying i 've been asking to testify for some time and to do it in public , which was not originally agreed to but let s just take a minute here and point out that this committee is basically an arm of the republican national committee \( applause \) it is a partisan vehicle , as admitted by the house republican majority leader , mr mccarthy , to drive down my poll numbers big surprise and that s what they have attempted to do i am still standing i am happy to be part of this debate \( applause \) and i intend to keep talking about the issues that matter to the american people you know , i believe strongly that we need to be talking about what people talk to me about , like how are we going to make college affordable \? how are we going to pay down student debt \? secretary how are we going to get health care for everybody \( crosstalk \) secretary clinton , secretary clinton , with all due respect , it s a little hard i mean , is n't it a little bit hard to call this just a partisan issue \? there s an fbi investigation , and president obama himself just two days ago said this is a legitimate issue well , i never said it was n't legitimate i said that i have answered all the questions and i will certainly be doing so again before this committee but i think it would be really unfair not to look at the entire picture this committee has spent 45 million of taxpayer money , and they said that they were trying to figure out what we could do better to protect our diplomats so that something like benghazi would n't happen again there were already seven committee reports about what to do so i think it s pretty clear what their obvious goal is thank you but i 'll be there i 'll answer their questions but tonight , i want to talk not about my emails , but about what the american people want from the next president of the united states \( applause \) senator sanders \? let me say this \( applause \) let me say let me say something that may not be great politics but i think the secretary is right , and that is that the american people are sick and tired of hearing about your damn emails \( applause \) thank you me , too me , too you know \? the middle class anderson , and let me say something about the media , as well i go around the country , talk to a whole lot of people middle class in this country is collapsing we have 27 million people living in poverty we have massive wealth and income inequality our trade policies have cost us millions of decent jobs the american people want to know whether we 're going to have a democracy or an oligarchy as a result of citizens union enough of the emails let s talk about the real issues facing america \( applause \) thank you , bernie thank you \( applause \) it s obviously very popular in this crowd , and it s hold on \( applause \) i know that plays well in this room but i got to be honest , governor chafee , for the record , on the campaign trail , you 've said a different thing you said this is a huge issue standing here in front of secretary clinton , are you willing to say that to her face \? absolutely we have to repair american credibility after we told the world that saddam hussein had weapons of mass destruction , which he did n't so there s an issue of american credibility out there so any time someone is running to be our leader , and a world leader , which the american president is , credibility is an issue out there with the world and we have repair work to be done i think we need someone that has the best in ethical standards as our next president that s how i feel secretary clinton , do you want to respond \? no governor governor \( applause \) governor o'malley \( applause \) governor , it s popular in the room , but a lot of people do want to know these answers governor o'malley , you expressed concern on the campaign trail that the democratic party is , and i quote , being defined by hillary clinton s email scandal you heard her answer , do you still feel that way tonight \? i believe that now that we 're finally having debates , anderson , that we do n't have to be defined by the email scandal , and how long what the fbi s asking about instead , we can talk about affordable college , making college debt free , and all the issues which is why and i see the chair of the dnc here , look how glad we are actually to be talking about the issues that matter the most to people around the kitchen table we need to get wages to go up , college more affordable thank you , governor we need to make american 100 percent clean electric by 2050 i want to talk about issues of race in america , for that i want to start of with don lemon alright , anderson , thank you very much i'm not sure how to follow that , but this question is about something that has tripped some of the candidates up out on the campaign trail can you hear me \? ca n't hear me in the room ok , here we go again , as i said law school my question for the candidates is , do black lives matter , or do all lives matter \? the question from arthur there we go do black lives matter , or do all lives matter \? let s put that question to senator sanders black lives matter \( cheering \) and the reason the reason those words matter is the african american community knows that on any given day some innocent person like sandra bland can get into a car , and then three days later she s going to end up dead in jail , or their kids \( applause \) are going to get shot we need to combat institutional racism from top to bottom , and we need major , major reforms in a broken criminal justice system \( applause \) in which we have more people in jail than china and , i intended to tackle that issue to make sure that our people have education and jobs rather than jail cells \( applause \) governor o'malley , the question from arthur was do black lives matter , or do all lives matter \? anderson , the point that the black lives matter movement is making is a very , very legitimate and serious point , and that is that as a nation we have undervalued the lives of black lives , people of color when i ran for mayor of baltimore and we we burying over 350 young men ever single year , mostly young , and poor , and black , and i said to our legislature , at the time when i appeared in front of them as a mayor , that if we were burying white , young , poor men in these number we would be marching in the streets and there would be a different reaction black lives matter , and we have a lot of work to do to reform our criminal justice system , and to address race relations in our country \( applause \) secretary clinton , what would you do for african americans in this country that president obama could n't \? well , i think that president obama has been a great moral leader on these issues , and has laid out an agenda that has been obstructed by the republicans at every turn , so \( applause \) so , what we need to be doing is not only reforming criminal justice i have talked about that at some length , including things like body cameras , but we also need to be following the recommendations of the commissioner that president obama empanelled on policing there is an agenda there that we need to be following up on similarly , we need to tackle mass incarceration , and this may be the only bipartisan issue in the congress this year we actually have people on both sides of the aisle who have reached the same conclusion , that we can not keep imprisoning more people than anybody else in the world but , i believe that the debate , and the discussion has to go further , anderson , because we 've got to do more about the lives of these children that s why i started off by saying we need to be committed to making it possible for every child to live up to his or her god given potential that is thank you , senator really hard to do if you do n't have early childhood education senator if you do n't have schools that are able to meet the needs of the people , or good housing , there s a long list \( applause \) we need a new new deal for communities of color senator webb \? i hope i can get that kind of time here as a president of the united states , every life in this country matters at the same time , i believe i can say to you , i have had a long history of working with the situation of african americans we 're talking about criminal justice reform , i risked my political life raising the issue of criminal justice reform when i ran for the senate in virginia in 2006 i had democratic party political consultants telling me i was committing political suicide we led that issue in the congress we started a national debate on it and it was n't until then that the republican party started joining in i also represented a socalled war criminal , an african american marine who was wounded who was convicted of murder in vietnam , for six years he took his life three years into this i cleared his name after after three years thanks , sir and i put the african american soldier on the mall i made that recommendation and fought for it so , if you want someone who is can stand up in front of you right now and say i have done the hard job , i have taken the risks , i am your person senator sanders , let s talk about income inequality wages and incomes are flat you 've argued that the gap between rich and poor is wider than at any time since the 1920s we 've had a democratic president for seven years what are you going to be able to do that president obama did n't \? well , first of all , let s remember where we were when bush left office we were losing 800 , 000 jobs a month and i know my republican friends seem to have some amnesia on this issue , but the world s financial crisis was on the world s financial markets system was on the verge of collapse that s where we were are we better off today than we were then \? absolutely but the truth is that for the 40 years , the great middle class of this country has been disappearing and in my view what we need to do is create millions of jobs by rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure raise the minimum wage to 15 an hour pay equity for women workers and our disastrous trade policies , which have cost us millions of jobs and make every public college and university in this country tuition free \( applause \) secretary clinton \( crosstalk \) i 'll let you jump in a moment everybody will get in on this in a moment secretary clinton , how would you address this issue \? in all candor , you and your husband are part of the one percent how can you credibly represent the views of the middle class \? well , you know , both bill and i have been very blessed neither of us came from wealthy families and we 've worked really hard our entire lives and i want to make sure every single person in this country has the same opportunities that he and i have had , to make the most of their godgiven potential and to have the chances that they should have in america for a good education , good job training , and then good jobs i have a five point economic plan , because this inequality challenge we face , we have faced it at other points it s absolutely right it has n't been this bad since the 1920s but if you look at the republicans versus the democrats when it comes to economic policy , there is no comparison the economy does better when you have a democrat in the white house and that s why we need to have a democrat in the white house in january 2017 governor o'malley , \( inaudible \) yes anderson , i want to associate myself with many of the items that the senator from vermont mentioned , and i actually did them in our state we raised the minimum wage , passed the living wage , invested more in infrastructure , went four years in a row without a penny s increase in college tuition but there s another piece that senator sanders left out tonight , but he s been excellent about underscoring that and that is that we need to separate the casino , speculative , megabank gambling that we have to insure with our money , from the commercial banking namely , reinstating glasssteagall secretary clinton mentioned my support eight years ago and secretary , i was proud to support you eight years ago , but something happened in between , and that is , anderson , a wall street crash that wiped out millions of jobs and millions of savings for families and we are still just as vulnerable paul volcker says today we need to reinstate glasssteagall and that s a huge difference on this stage among us as candidates just for viewers at home who may not be reading up on this , glasssteagall is the depressionera banking law repealed in 1999 that prevented commercial banks from engaging in investment banking and insurance activities secretary clinton , he raises a fundamental difference on this stage senator sanders wants to break up the big wall street banks you do n't you say charge the banks more , continue to monitor them why is your plan better \? well , my plan is more comprehensive and frankly , it s tougher because of course we have to deal with the problem that the banks are still too big to fail we can never let the american taxpayer and middle class families ever have to bail out the kind of speculative behavior that we saw but we also have to worry about some of the other players aig , a big insurance company lehman brothers , an investment bank there s this whole area called shadow banking that s where the experts tell me the next potential problem could come from so i'm with both senator sanders and governor o'malley in putting a lot of attention onto the banks and the plan that i have put forward would actually empower regulators to break up big banks if we thought they posed a risk but i want to make sure we 're going to cover everybody , not what caused the problem last time , but what could cause it next time \( crosstalk \) senator sanders , secretary clinton just said that her policy is tougher than yours well , that s not true \( laughter \) why \? let us be clear that the greed and recklessness and illegal behavior of wall street , where fraud is a business model , helped to destroy this economy and the lives of millions of people \( applause \) check the record in the 1990s and all due respect in the 1990s , when i had the republican leadership and wall street spending billions of dollars in lobbying , when the clinton administration , when alan greenspan said , what a great idea it would be to allow these huge banks to merge , bernie sanders fought them , and helped lead the opposition to deregulation \( applause \) today , it is my view that when you have the three senator largest banks in america are much bigger than they were when we bailed them out for being too big to fail , we have got to break them up \( applause \) secretary clinton , you have to be able to respond he brought you up yeah you know , i i respect the passion an intensity i represented wall street , as a senator from new york , and i went to wall street in december of 2007 before the big crash that we had and i basically said , cut it out ! quit foreclosing on homes ! quit engaging in these kinds of speculative behaviors i took on the bush administration for the same thing so i have thought deeply and long about what we 're gonna do to do exactly what i think both the senator and the governor want , which is to rein in and stop this risk and my plan would have the potential of actually sending the executives to jail nobody went to jail after 100 billion in fines were paid \( applause \) \( inaudible \) and would give regulators the authority to go after the big banks thank you thank you senator sanders but i'm telling you i will say it tonight if only you look at the big banks , you may be missing the forest for the trees \( crosstalk \) bernie , say my name so i can get into this i will , just a second ok thank you \( laughter \) i 'll tell him in my view , secretary clinton , you do not congress does not regulate wall street wall street regulates congress \( applause \) and we have gotta break off these banks going to them so and saying , please , do the right thing no , that s not what is kind of naive that i think doddfrank was a very anderson , i need to jump in \( inaudible \) good start , and i think that we have to implement it we have to prevent the republicans from ripping it apart we have to save the consumer financial protection board , which is finally beginning to act to protect consumers \( applause \) we have work to do you 've got no argument from me but i know , if we do n't come in with a very tough and comprehensive approach , like the plan i'm recommending , we 're gonna be behind instead of ahead governor o'malley \? where do you stand \? on what the next crisis could be anderson , look , this is the big banks i mean , once we repealed glasssteagall back in the late 1999s \( ph \) , the big banks , the six of them , went from controlling , what , the equivalent of 15 percent of our gdp to now 65 percent of our gdp and \( inaudible \) right before this debate , secretary clinton s campaign put out a lot of reversals on positions on keystone and many other things but one of them that we still have a great difference on , madam secretary , is that you are not for glasssteagall you are not for putting a firewall between this speculative , risky shadow banking behavior i am , and the people of our country need a president who s on their side , willing to protect the main street economy from recklessness on wall street we have to fulfill secretary clinton our promise i have to let you respond \( applause \) well , you know , everybody on this stage has changed a position or two we 've been around a cumulative quite some period of time \( laughter \) you know , we know that if you are learning , you 're gonna change your position i never took a position on keystone until i took a position on keystone but i have been on the forefront of dealing with climate change , starting in 2009 , when president obama and i crashed \( ph \) a meeting with the chinese and got them to sign up to the first international agreement to combat climate change that they 'd ever joined so i'm thank you not taking a back seat to anybody on my values thank my principles and the results that i get senator sanders \( applause \) senator sanders , in 2008 , congressional leaders were told , without the 2008 bailout , the us was possibly days away from a complete meltdown despite that , you still voted against it as president , would you stand by your principles if it risked the country s financial stability \? well , i remember that meeting very well i remember it like it was yesterday hank paulson , bernanke came in , and they say , guys , the economy is going to collapse because wall street is going under it s gonna take the economy with them and you know what i said to hank paulson \? i said , hank , your guys you come from goldman sachs your millionaire and billionaire friends caused this problem how about your millionaire and billionaire friends paying for the bailout , not working families in this country \? so to answer your question , no , i would not have let the economy collapse but it was wrong to ask the middle class to bail out wall street and by the way , i want wall street now to help kids in this country go to college , public colleges and universities , free with a wall street speculation tax \( applause \) we 're going to talk about that in a minute but , senator webb , i want to get you in you have said neither party has the guts to take on wall street is the system rigged \? there is a reality that i think we all need to recognize with respect to the power of the financial sector and let me just go back a minute and say that on this tarp program , i introduced a piece of legislation calling for a windfall profits tax on the executives of any of these companies that got more than 5 billion , that it was time for them , once they got their compensation and their bonus , to split the rest of the money they made with the nurses and the truck drivers and the soldiers who bailed them out with respect to the financial sector , i mean , i know that my time has run out but in speaking of changing positions and the position on how this debate has occurred is kind of frustrating because unless somebody mentions my name i ca n't get into the discussion you agreed to these rules and you 're wasting time so if you would finish your answer , we 'll move on all right well , i'm trying to set a mark here so maybe we can get into a little more later on this has n't been equal time but if you want to look at what has happened , if we look at the facts in terms of how we 're going to deal with this , since that crash , in the last 10 years , the amount of the world s capital economy that wall street manages has gone from 44 percent to 55 percent that means the wall street money managers are not risking themselves as the same way the american people are when they 're going to get their compensation they 're managing money from all over the world we have to take that into consideration when we 're looking at ways to regulate it governor chafee , you have attacked secretary clinton for being too close to wall street banks in 1999 you voted for the very bill that made banks bigger the glasssteagall was my very first vote , i 'd just arrived , my dad had died in office , i was appointed to the office , it was my very first vote are you saying you did n't know what you were voting for \? i 'd just arrived at the senate i think we 'd get some takeovers , and that was one it was my very first vote , and it was 925 it was the well , with all due respect , governor but let me just say what does that say about you that you 're casting a vote for something you were n't really sure about \? i think you 're being a little rough i 'd just arrived at the united states senate i 'd been mayor of my city my dad had died i 'd been appointed by the governor it was the first vote and it was 905 , because it was a conference report but let me just say about income inequality we 've had a lot of talk over the last few minutes , hours , or tens of minutes , but no one is saying how we 're going to fix it and it all started with the bush tax cuts that favored the wealthy so let s go back to the tax code and 06 percent of americans are at the top echelon , over 464 , 000 , 06 americans that s less than 1 percent but they generate 30 percent of the revenue and they 're doing fine thank you , governor so there s still a lot more money to be had from this top echelon i'm saying let s have another tier and put that back into the tax bracket and that will generate 42 billion i want to bring in dana bash and then we can help the middle class and hardearning americans hardworking americans dana \? thank you cnn visited college campuses , along with facebook and not surprisingly college affordability was among the most pressing issue senator sanders , you 've mentioned a couple of times you do have a plan to make public colleges free for everyone secretary clinton has criticized that in saying she s not in favor of making a college free for donald trump s kids do you think taxpayers should pick up the tab for wealthy children \? well , let me tell you , donald trump and his billionaire friends under my policies are going to pay a hell of a lot more in taxes today taxes in the future than they 're paying today \( applause \) but in terms of education , this is what i think this is the year 2015 a college degree today , dana , is the equivalent of what a high school degree was 50 years ago and what we said 50 years ago and a hundred years ago is that every kid in this country should be able to get a high school education regardless of the income of their family i think we have to say that is true for everybody going to college i think we do n't need a complicated system , which the secretary is talking about , the income goes down , the income goes down , if you 're poor you have to work , and so forth and so on i pay for my program , by the way , through a tax on wall street speculation , which will not only make public colleges and universities tuitionfree , it will substantially lower interest rates on college debt , a major crisis in this country \( applause \) and , secretary clinton , it s not just college tuition that senator sanders is talking about , expanding social security and giving all americans medicare what s wrong with that \? well , let me address college affordability , because i have a plan that i think will really zero in on what the problems are first , all the 40 million americans who currently have student debt will be able to refinance their debt to a low interest rate that will save thousands of dollars for people who are now struggling under this cumbersome , burdensome college debt as a young student in nevada said to me , the hardest thing about going to college should not be paying for it so then we have to make it more affordable how do we make it more affordable \? my plan would enable anyone to go to a public college or university tuition free you would not have to borrow money for tuition but i do believe and maybe it s because i worked when i went through college i worked when i went through law school i think it s important for everybody to have some part of getting this accomplished that s why i call it a compact secretary clinton but , yes , i would like students to work 10 hours a week can you answer the in order to make it possible for them to afford their education and i want colleges to get their costs down they are outrageously high in what they 're charging secretary clinton , the question was not just about tuition , though it was about senator sanders' plan to expand social security , to make medicare available to all americans is that something that you would support \? and if not , why not \? well , i fully support social security and the most important fight we 're going to have is defending it against continuing republican efforts to privatize it do you want to expand it \? i want to enhance the benefits for the poorest recipients of social security we have a lot of women on social security , particularly widowed and single women who did n't make a lot of money during their careers , and they are impoverished , and they need more help from the social security system and i will focus i will focus on helping those people who need it the most and of course i'm going to defend social security i'm going to look for ways to try to make sure it s solvent into the future and we also need to talk about health care at some time , because we agree on the goals , we just disagree on the means when the republicans when the republicans in the congress and some democrats were talking about cutting social security and benefits for disabled veterans , for the socalled chained cpi , i founded a caucus called the defending social security caucus my view is that when you have millions of seniors in this country trying to get by and i do n't know how they do on 11 , 000 , 12 , 000 , 13 , 000 a year you do n't cut social security , you expand it and the way you expand it is by lifting the cap on taxable incomes so that you do away with the absurdity of a millionaire paying the same amount into the system as somebody making 118 , 000 you do that , social security is solvent until 2061 and you can expand benefits \( crosstalk \) senator sanders , i want to bring it over to juan carlos lopez from cnn en espanol we 're obviously in nevada it s had the highest percentage of undocumented immigrants of any state in the country as of last year juan carlos \? gracias , anderson senator sanders , in 2013 , you voted for immigration reform but in 2007 , when democrats controlled congress and the bush white house was onboard , you voted against it why should latino voters trust you now when you left them at the altar at the moment when reform was very close \? i did n't leave anybody at the altar i voted against that piece of legislation because it had guestworker provisions in it which the southern poverty law center talked about being semislavery guest workers are coming in , they 're working under terrible conditions , but if they stand up for their rights , they 're thrown out of the country i was not the only progressive to vote against that legislation for that reason tom harkin , a very good friend of hillary clinton s and mine , one of the leading labor advocates , also voted against that tom harkin is n't running for president you are i know that but point being is that progressives did vote against that for that reason my view right now and always has been is that when you have 11 million undocumented people in this country , we need comprehensive immigration reform , we need a path toward citizenship , we need to take people out of the shadows and juan carlos juan carlos secretary clinton secretary clinton , governor o'malley wants to open up obamacare to millions of undocumented immigrants and their children , including almost 90 , 000 people right here in nevada do you \? well , first of all , i want to make sure every child gets health care that s why i helped to create the children s health insurance program , and i want to support states that are expanding health care and including undocumented children and others i want to open up the opportunity for immigrants to be able to buy in to the exchanges under the affordable care act i think to go beyond that , as i understand what governor o'malley has recommended , so that they would get the same subsidies i think that is it raises so many issues it would be very difficult to administer , it needs to be part of a comprehensive immigration reform , when we finally do get to it governor o'malley \? juan carlos , i think what you 've heard up here is some of the old thinking on immigration reform , and that s why it s gridlocked we need to understand that our country is stronger in every generation by the arrival of new american immigrants that is why i have put out a policy for comprehensive immigration reform , that is why i would go further than president obama has on daca , and dapa i mean , we are a nation of immigrants , we are made stronger by immigrants do you think for a second that simply because somebody s standing in a broken que on naturalization they 're not going to go to the hospital , and that care is n't going to fall on to our insurance rates \? i am for a generous , compassionate america that says we 're all in this together we need comprehensive senator webb immigration reform it 'll make wages go up in america 250 for every year senator webb , do you support the undocumented immigrants getting obamacare \? i would n't have a problem with that let me start by saying my wife is an immigrant she was a refugee , her family escaped from vietnam on a boat her entire extended family , after the communists took over , when hundreds of thousands of people were out there and thousands of them were dying went to two refugee camps , she never spoke english in her home , and she ended , as i said , graduating from cornell law school that s not only american dream , that s a value that we have with a good immigration system in place no country has is a country without defining its borders we need to resolve this issue i actually introduced an amendment in the 2007 immigration bill thank you , senator giving a pathway to citizenship to those people who had come here , and put down their roots , and met as a series of standards thank you , senator lost \( ph \) i introduced that in 2007 we need a comprehensive reform , and we need to be able to define our borders secretary clinton \? i want to follow up because i think underneath juan carlos' important questions , there is such a difference between everything you 're hearing here on this stage , and what we hear from the republicans \( applause \) here here \( cheering \) \( applause \) demonize hardworking immigrants who have insulted them you know , i came to las vegas in , i think , may early may met with a group of dreamers , i wish everybody in america could meet with this young people , to hear their stories , to know their incredible talent , their determination , and that s why i would go further secretary than even the executive orders that president obama has signed when i'm president \( cross talk \) secretary clinton , let me ask you two of your rivals from your left , governor o'malley , and senator sanders , want to provide instate college tuition to undocumented immigrants where do you stand on that \? my plan would support any state that takes that position , and would work with those states and encourage more states to do the same thing so , on the record , you believe that undocumented immigrants should get instate college tuition if their states agree , then we want more states to do the same thing cooper governor o'malley \? anderson , we actually did this in my state of maryland we passed \( applause \) we passed a state version of the dream act \( cheering \) and a lot of the xenophobes , the immigrant haters like some that we 've heard like , donald trump , that carnival barker in the republican party \( cheering \) \( applause \) tried to mischaracterize it as free tuition for illegal immigrants but , we took our case to the people when it was petitioned to referendum , and we won with 58 percent of the vote the more our children learn , the more they will earn , and that s true of children who have yet to be naturalized senator but will become american citizens senator sanders , you talked about your record on the veteran affairs committee you served on that committee for the last eight years , including two years as its chairman while veterans died waiting for health care you and senator mccain ultimately addressed the issue with bipartisan legislation why did it take 18 inspector general reports , and a cnn investigation , and others , before you and your colleagues took action \? well , i was chairman for two years , and when i was chairman we did take action what we did is pass a 15 billion dollar piece of legislation which brought in many , many new doctors , and nurses into the va so that veterans in this country could get the health care when they needed it , and not be on long waiting lines and , the other part of that legislation said that if a veteran is living more than 40 miles away from a va facility , that veteran could get health care from the community health center , or the private sector as a result of that legislation , we went further in than any time in recent history in improving health care for the men and women of this country who put their lives on the line to defend them governor chafee , you and hillary clinton both voted for the patriot act which created the nsa surveillance program you 've emphasized civil liberties , privacy during your campaign are n't these two things in conflict \? no , that was another 99 to one vote for the patriot act , and it was seen as at the time modernizing our ability to do what we 've always done to tap phones which always required a warrant and i voted for that do you regret that vote \? no , no as long as you 're getting a warrant , i believe that under the fourth amendment , you should be able to do surveillance , but you need a warrant that s what the fourth amendment says and in the patriot act , section 215 started to get broadened too far so i would be in favor of addressing and reforming section 215 of the patriot act secretary clinton , do you regret your vote on the patriot act \? no , i do n't i think that it was necessary to make sure that we were able after 9 11 to put in place the security that we needed and it is true that it did require that there be a process what happened , however , is that the bush administration began to chip away at that process and i began to speak out about their use of warrantless surveillance and the other behavior that they engaged in we always have to keep the balance of civil liberties , privacy and security it s not easy in a democracy , but we have to keep it in mind senator senator sanders , you 're the only one on this stage who voted against the patriot act in 2001 \( applause \) it was 99 to one and i was maybe the one i do n't know and the reauthorization votes let me ask you , if elected , would you shut down the nsa surveillance program \? i'm sorry \? would you shut down the nsa surveillance program \? absolutely of course you would , point blank well , i would shut down make i 'd shut down what exists right now is that virtually every telephone call in this country ends up in a file at the nsa that is unacceptable to me but it s not just government surveillance i think the government is involved in our emails is involved in our websites corporate america is doing it as well if we are a free country , we have the right to be free yes , we have to defend ourselves against terrorism , but there are ways to do that without impinging on our constitutional rights and our privacy rights \( \? \) anderson , the nsa governor chafee , edward snowden , is he a traitor or a hero \? no , i would bring him home the courts have ruled that what he did what he did was say the american \( crosstalk \) bring him home , no jail time \? the american government was acting illegally that s what the federal courts have said what snowden did showed that the american government was acting illegally for the fourth amendment so i would bring him home secretary clinton , hero or traitor \? he broke the laws of the united states he could have been a whistleblower he could have gotten all of the protections of being a whistleblower he could have raised all the issues that he has raised and i think there would have been a positive response to that should he do jail time \? clinton in addition in addition , he stole very important information that has unfortunately fallen into a lot of the wrong hands so i do n't think he should be brought home without facing the music governor o'malley , snowden \? \( applause \) anderson , snowden put a lot of americans' lives at risk snowden broke the law whistleblowers do not run to russia and try to get protection from putin if he really believes that , he should be back here senator sanders , edward snowden \? i think snowden played a very important role in educating the american people to the degree in which our civil liberties and our constitutional rights are being undermined is he a hero \? he did he did break the law , and i think there should be a penalty to that but i think what he did in educating us should be taken into consideration before he is \( inaudible \)  senator webb , edward snowden \? i well , i i would leave his ultimate judgment to the legal system here s what i do believe we have a serious problem in terms of the collection of personal information in this country and one of the things that i did during the fisa bill in 2007 , the foreign intelligence surveillance act , was introduce with russ feingold two amendments basically saying , we understand the realities of how you have to collect this broad information in the internet age , but after a certain period of time , you need to destroy the personal information that you have if people have not been brought if criminal justice proceedings have not been brought against them we 've got a vast data bank of information that is ripe for people with bad intentions to be able to use and they need to be destroyed another another question for each of you , starting with governor chafee name the one thing the one way that your administration would not be a third term of president obama certainly , ending the wars we 've got to stop these wars you have to have a new dynamic , a new paradigm we just spent a halfbillion dollars arming and training soldiers , the rebel soldiers in syria they quickly join the other side we bombed the \( crosstalk \) president obama s generals right now are suggesting keeping troops in afghanistan after the time he wanted them pulled out would you keep them there \? i 'd like to finish my question my answer and also we just bombed a hospital we 've had drone strikes that hit civilian weddings so i would change how we our approach to the middle east we need a new paradigm in the middle east governor o'malley , how would you be different than president obama s administration \? i would follow through on the promise that the american people thought we made as democratic party , to protect the main street economy from recklessness on wall street i would push to separate out these toobigtojail , toobigtofail banks , and put in place glasssteagall , a modern glasssteagall that creates a firewall so that this wreckage of our economy can never happen again secretary clinton , how would you not be a third term of president obama \? well , i think that s pretty obvious i think being the first woman president would be quite a change from the presidents we 've had up until this point , including president obama is there a policy difference \? well , there s a lot that i would like to do to build on the successes of president obama , but also , as i'm laying out , to go beyond and that s in my economic plans , how i would deal with the prescription drug companies , how i would deal with college , how i would deal with a full range of issues that i 've been talking about throughout this campaign to go further senator sanders \? i have a lot of respect for president obama i have worked with him time and time again on many , many issues but here s where i do disagree i believe that the power of corporate america , the power of wall street , the power of the drug companies , the power of the corporate media is so great that the only way we really transform america and do the things that the middle class and working class desperately need is through a political revolution when millions of people begin to come together and stand up and say our government is going to work for all of us , not just a handful of billionaires \( applause \) senator webb , how would you not be a third term for obama \? i got a great deal of admiration and affection for senator sanders , but i bernie , i do n't think the revolution s going to come and i do n't think the congress is going to pay for a lot of this stuff and if there would be a major difference between my administration and the obama administration , it would be in the use of executive authority i came up as a committee counsel in the congress , used to put dozens of bills through the house floor every year as a committee counsel on the veterans committee i have a very strong feeling about how our federal system works and how we need to lead and energize the congressional process instead of allowing these divisions to continue to paralyze what we 're doing so i would lead working with both parties in the congress and working through them in the traditional way that our constitution sets \( ph \) senator sanders , he cited you you do n't hear a lot of democratic presidential candidates talking about revolution what do you mean \? what i mean is that we need to have one of the larger voter turnouts in the world , not one of the lowest we need to raise public consciousness we need the american people to know what s going on in washington in a way that today they do not know \( applause \) and when people come together in a way that does not exist now and are prepared to take on the big money interest , then we could bring the kind of change we need anderson , i actually have talked about a revolution what we need is a green energy revolution we need to move america to a 100 percent clean electric grid by 2050 and create 5 million jobs along the way and we want to and we 're going to talk more about climate change and environmental issues coming up some of the candidates have tried marijuana , as have pretty much probably everybody in this room \( laughter \) others have not does that influence does it influence their views on legalization \? find out that and others ahead \( commercial break \) and welcome back to this cnn democratic presidential debate it has been quite a night so far we are in the final block of this debate all the candidates are back , which i'm very happy to see \( laughter \) it s a long story let s continue , shall we \? secretary clinton , welcome back well , thank you \( laughter \) you know , it does take me a little longer that s all i can say that s right secretary clinton , governor o'malley says the presidency is not a crown to be passed back and forth between two royal families this year has been the year of the outsider in politics , just ask bernie sanders why should democrats embrace an insider like yourself \? well , i ca n't think of anything more of an outsider than electing the first woman president , but i'm not just running because i would be the first woman president \( applause \) i'm running because i have a lifetime of experience in getting results and fighting for people , fighting for kids , for women , for families , fighting to even the odds and i know what it takes to get things done i know how to find common ground and i know how to stand my ground and i think we 're going to need both of those in washington to get anything that we 're talking about up here accomplished so i'm very happy that i have both the commitment of a lifetime and the experience of a lifetime to bring together to offer the american people governor o'malley , do you want to tell secretary clinton why she should n't get the crown \? well , actually , you know , we had this conversation and i will share with you that i 've traveled all around the country , anderson , and there s two phrases i keep hearing again and again and again and they 're the phrases new leadership and getting things done we cannot be this dissatisfied with our gridlocked national politics and an economy where 70 percent of us are earning the same or less than we were 12 years ago , and think that a resort to old names is going to move us forward i respect what secretary clinton and her husband have done for our country but our country needs new leadership to move forward secretary clinton , you have to be able to respond , if you want well , i would not ask anyone to vote for me based on my last name i would ask them to listen to what i'm proposing , look at what i 've accomplished in the senate , as secretary of of state , and then draw your own conclusion i certainly am not campaigning to become president because my last name is clinton i'm campaigning because i think i have the right combination of what the country needs , at this point , and i think i can take the fight to the republicans , because we cannot afford a republican to succeed barack obama as president of the united states \( inaudible \) \( applause \) senator sanders , does she have the right stuff \? i think i think that there is profound frustration all over this country with establishment politics i am the only candidate running for president who is not a billionaire , who has raised substantial sums of money , and i do not have a super pac \( applause \) i am not raising money from millionaires and billionaires , and in fact , tonight , in terms of what a political revolution is about , there are 4 , 000 house parties 100 , 000 people in this country watching this debate tonight who want real change in this country we 've got we a lot of questions we 've got about climate change , and we 're gonna go to don lemon don \? all right this one is for martin o'malley anderson , governor o'malley , this is from anna bettis from tempe , arizona here it is \( begin video clip \) uestion as a young person , i'm very concerned about climate change and how it will affect my future as a presidential candidate , what will you do to address climate change \? \( end video clip \) so , governor o'malley , please tell anna how you would protect the environment better than all the other candidates up on that stage yeah anna , i have put forward a plan and i'm the only candidate , i believe , in either party to do this to move america forward to a 100 percent clean electric grid by 2050 we did not land a man on the moon with an alloftheabove strategy it was an intentional engineering challenge , and we solved it as a nation and our nation must solve this one so i put forward the plan that would extend the investor tax credits for solar and for wind if you go across iowa , you see that 30 percent of their energy now comes from wind we 're here in las vegas , one of the most sustainable cities in america , doing important things in terms of green building , architecture and design we can get there as a nation , but it s going to require presidential leadership and as president , i intend to sign as my very first order in office the an order that moves us as a nation and dedicates our resources to solving this problem and moving us to a 100 percent clean electric grid by 2050 governor we can do it governor o'malley , thank you very much \( applause \) senator webb , you have a very different view than just about anybody else on this stage , and unlike a lot of democrats you 're procoal , you 're prooffshore drilling , you 're prokeystone pipeline are again , are you the question is , are you out of step with the democratic party \? well , the the question really is how are we going to solve energy problems here and in the global environment if you really want to address climate change \? and when i was in the senate , i was an alloftheabove energy voter we introduced legislation to bring in alternate energy as well as nuclear power i'm a strong proponent of nuclear power it is safe , it is clean and really , we are not going to solve climate change simply with the laws here we 've done a good job in this country since 1970 if you look at china and india , they 're the greatest polluters in the world fifteen out of the 20 most polluted cities in the world are in one of those two countries we need to solve this in a global way it s a global problem and i have been very strong on on doing that the the agreements the socalled agreements that we have had with china are illusory in terms of the immediate requirements of the of the chinese government itself so let s solve this problem in an international way , and then we really will have a a way to address climate change senator sanders , are you tougher on on climate change than secretary clinton \? well , i will tell you this i believe and pope francis made this point this is a moral issue the scientists are telling us that we need to move extremely boldly i am proud that , along with senator barbara boxer , a few years ago , we introduced the first piece of climate change legislation which called for a tax on carbon and let me also tell you that nothing is gonna happen unless we are prepared to deal with campaign finance reform , because the fossil fuel industry is funding the republican party , which denies the reality of climate change \( applause \) and certainly is not prepared to go forward aggressively this is a moral issue we have got to be extremely aggressive in working with china , india , russia senator thank you , senator the planet the future of the planet is at stake secretary clinton , i want you to be able to respond , then i'm gonna go to \( ph \) \( inaudible \) well , that that s exactly what i 've been doing when we met in copenhagen in 2009 and , literally , president obama and i were hunting for the chinese , going throughout this huge convention center , because we knew we had to get them to agree to something because there will be no effective efforts against climate change unless china and india join with the rest of the world they told us they 'd left for the airport we found out they were having a secret meeting we marched up , we broke in , we said , we 've been looking all over for you let s sit down and talk about what we need to do and we did come up with the first international agreement that china has signed thanks to president obama s leadership , it s now gone much further thank you clinton and i do think that the bilateral agreement that president obama made with the chinese was significant now , it needs to go further , and there will be an international meeting at the end of this year , and we must get verifiable commitments to fight climate change from every country gathered there dana bash \? secretary clinton , you now support mandated paid family leave mmhmm carly fiorina , the first female ceo of a fortune 50 company , argues , if the government requires paid leave , it will force small businesses to , quote , hire fewer people and create fewer jobs what do you say not only to carly fiorina , but also a smallbusiness owner out there who says , you know , i like this idea , but i just ca n't afford it \? well , i'm surprised she says that , because california has had a paid leave program for a number of years and it s it s on the federal level well , but all well , on a state level , a state as big as many countries in the world and it has not had the ill effects that the republicans are always saying it will have and i think this is this is typical republican scare tactics we can design a system and pay for it that does not put the burden on small businesses i remember as a young mother , you know , having a baby wake up who was sick and i'm supposed to be in court , because i was practicing law i know what it s like and i think we need to recognize the incredible challenges that so many parents face , particularly working moms i see my good friend , senator gillibrand , in the front row she s been a champion of this we need to get a consensus through this campaign , which is why i'm talking about it everywhere i go , and we need to join the rest of the advanced world in having it but secretary secretary clinton , even many people who agree with you might say , look , this is very hard to do , especially in today s day and age there are so many people who say , really \? another government program \? is that what you 're proposing \? and at the expense of taxpayer money \? well , look , you know , when people say that it s always the republicans or their sympathizers who say , you ca n't have paid leave , you ca n't provide health care they do n't mind having big government to interfere with a woman s right to choose and to try to take down planned parenthood they 're fine with big government when it comes to that i'm sick of it \( applause \) you know , we can do these things \( applause \) we should not be paralyzed we should not be paralyzed by the republicans and their constant refrain , big government this , big government that , that except for what they want to impose on the american people i know we can afford it , because we 're going to make the wealthy pay for it that is the way to get it done thank you senator sanders \? yeah , dana , here s the point every other major country on earth , every one , including some small countries , say that when a mother has a baby , she should stay home with that baby we are the only major country that is an international embarrassment that we do not provide family paid family and medical leave \( applause \) second of all , the secretary is right republicans tell us we ca n't do anything except give tax breaks to billionaires and cut social security , medicare , and medicaid that s not what the american people want governor o'malley \? anderson , in our state , we actually expanded family leave and i have to agree with secretary clinton and senator sanders look , the genius of our nation is that we find ways in every generation to include more of our people more fully in the economic life of our country , and we need to do that for our families , and especially so that women are n't penalized in having to drop out of the workforce my wife , katie , is here with our four kids and , man , that was a juggle when we had little kids and and keeping jobs and moving forwards we would be a stronger nation economically if we had paid family leave governor , thank you the issue now , particularly in this state , is recreational marijuana i want to go to juan carlos lopez thank you , anderson senator sanders , right here in nevada , there will be a measure to legalize recreational marijuana on the 2016 ballot you 've said you smoked marijuana twice it did n't quite work for you if you were a nevada resident , how would you vote \? i suspect i would vote yes \( applause \) and i would vote yes because i am seeing in this country too many lives being destroyed for nonviolent offenses we have a criminal justice system that lets ceos on wall street walk away , and yet we are imprisoning or giving jail sentences to young people who are smoking marijuana i think we have to think through this war on drugs \( applause \) which has done an enormous amount of damage we need to rethink our criminal justice system , we we 've got a lot of work to do in that area juan carlos \? \( applause \) secretary clinton , you told christiane amanpour you did n't smoke pot when you were young , and you 're not going to start now \( laughter \) when asked about legalizing recreational marijuana , you told her let s wait and see how it plays out in colorado and washington it s been more than a year since you 've said that are you ready to take a position tonight \? no i think that we have the opportunity through the states that are pursuing recreational marijuana to find out a lot more than we know today i do support the use of medical marijuana , and i think even there we need to do a lot more research so that we know exactly how we 're going to help people for whom medical marijuana provides relief so , i think we 're just at the beginning , but i agree completely with the idea that we have got to stop imprisoning people who use marijuana therefore , we need more states , cities , and the federal government to begin to address this so that we do n't have this terrible result that senator sanders was talking about where we have a huge population in our prisons for nonviolent , lowlevel offenses that are primarily due to marijuana secretary clinton , thank you i want to go to don lemon with another facebook question alright , anderson this is for senator sanders , ok \? this is from carrie \( ph \) kang \( ph \) from manassas , virginia , would like would like to ask the senator , president obama has had a difficult time getting republicans to compromise on just about every agenda how will you approach this going forward , and will it be any different \? senator \? the republican party , since i 've been in the senate , and since president obama has been in office , has played a terrible , terrible role of being total obstructionists every effort that he has made , that some of us have made , they have said no , no , no now , in my view , the only way we can take on the right wing republicans who are , by the way , i hope will not continue to control the senate and the house when one of us elected president \( applause \) but the only way we can get things done is by having millions of people coming together if we want free tuition at public colleges and universities , millions of young people are going to have to demand it , and give the republicans an offer they ca n't refuse if we want to raise the minimum wage to 15 bucks an hour , workers are going to have to come together and look the republicans in the eye , and say , we know what s going on you vote against us , you are out of your job \( applause \) we 're going to hear from all the candidates coming up we 're going to take a short break more from the candidates in a moment \( applause \) \( commercial break \) and welcome back to the final round of the cnn democratic presidential debate this is a question to each of you each of you , by the way , are going to have closing statements to make each of you will have 90 seconds but a final question to each of you if you can , just try to 15 seconds if you can governor chafee , franklin delano roosevelt once said , i ask you to judge me by the enemies i have made you 've all made a few people upset over your political careers which enemy are you most proud of \? \( laughter \) i guess the coal lobby i 've worked hard for climate change and i want to work with the coal lobby but in my time in the senate , tried to bring them to the table so that we could address carbon dioxide i'm proud to be at odds with the coal lobby governor o'malley \? the national rifle association \( applause \) secretary clinton \? well , in addition to the nra , the health insurance companies , the drug companies , the iranians \( laughter \) probably the republicans \( laughter \) \( applause \) senator sanders \? as someone who has taken on probably every special interest that there is in washington , i would lump wall street and the pharmaceutical industry at the top of my life of people who do not like me \( applause \) senator webb \? i 'd have to say the enemy soldier that threw the grenade that wounded me , but he s not around right now to talk to all right time for closing statements each of you will have 90 seconds governor chafee , let s begin with you thank you , anderson thank you , cnn and thank you , facebook , for sponsoring this debate america has many challenges confronting us ending the perpetual wars , addressing climate change , addressing income inequality , funding education , funding infrastructure , funding healthcare , helping black americans , helping native americans we have many challenges who is best able to confront these challenges \? i 've served in government at many levels i know what it s like to solve problems at the local level because i did it as mayor i know how to get legislation passed through congress because i did it as a senator i know how to turn around a state because i did as governor of rhode island but what i'm most proud of is that in 30 years of public service , i have had no scandals i have high ethical standards and what i'm most proud of is my judgment , particularly in the iraq war vote there was a lot of pressure political pressure , public pressure but i did my homework and i did not believe that the evidence was there that saddam hussein had weapons of mass destruction and we live now with the consequences so that kind of judgment is what we want in a president going forward and i'm running for president to end the wars i want to be the peacemaker i am a proven peacemaker please go to chafee 2016 to learn more about me thank you \( applause \) governor chafee , thank you very much senator webb , your final statement for 90 seconds thank you ladies and gentlemen , it s been a pleasure to be with you tonight you 've heard a lot of promises up here you 've heard a lot of rhetoric they all seem to happen during campaigns , and then once the election s over , people start from scratch again and try to get things done one of the things i can promise you , if you look at my record , in and out of government , is that i 've always been willing to take on a complicated , something unpopular issues , and work them through , the complex issues , and work them through in order to have the solution we did it with criminal justice reform we 've had a lot of discussion here about criminal justice reform we did it in other ways we need a national political strategy for our economy , for our social policy , for social justice , and , by the way , for how you run and manage the most complex bureaucracy in the world , which is the federal government i know how to lead i did it in vietnam , i did it in the pentagon , i did it in the senate , and if you will help me overcome this cavalcade of of financial irregularities and money that is poisoning our political process , i am ready to do that for you in the white house senator webb , thank you very much governor o'malley , you have 90 seconds anderson , thank you i am very , very grateful to have been able to be on this stage with this distinguished group of candidates tonight and what you heard tonight , anderson , was a very , very and all of you watching at home was a very , very different debate than from the sort of debate you heard from the two presidential republican debates \( applause \) on this stage on this stage , you did n't hear anyone denigrate women , you did n't hear anyone make racist comments about new american immigrants , you did n't hear anyone speak ill of another american because of their religious belief what you heard instead on this stage tonight was an honest search for the answers that will move our country forward , to move us to a 100 percent clean electric energy grid by 2050 , to take the actions that we have always taken as americans so that we can actually attack injustice in our country , employ more of our people , rebuild our cities and towns , educate our children at higher and better levels , and include more of our people in the economic

london revolutions have to start somewhere , but who would have thought that the attempt to impose reform upon fifa could take shape at the european parliament in brussels \? a will start wednesday , drawing together a mix of politicians , educators , business leaders , fans and disaffected soccer officials intent on forcing fifa to clean up its organization change does n't happen overnight , said damian collins , a british member of parliament who leads this initiative we are in this for as long as it takes our agenda is for real change in a new style of organization and with a new style of governance consistent with fifa s privileged position as custodians of the biggest sport in the world people said the fall of the would never happen they thought the olympic movement could never get past its corruption scandals , and that world cycling could not be cleaned up wednesday s meeting is the first step in helping to see football governed by people who make decisions in a transparent manner and who are held accountable in the best interests of the sport in a civilized society rhetoric alone will not change the situation by the end of may , sepp blatter , the man who has run fifa since 1998 and has been associated with it for 40 years , will run for another term as president no one doubts that he will be reelected there are , finally , challengers j r me champagne , a former french diplomat who once worked with blatter , declared himself a candidate 12 months ago even though he will address wednesday s summit meeting and has produced a 26page manifesto full of fresh ideas , champagne admitted monday that he had not been able to secure the minimum of five nominations needed from fifa s 209 member federations to even be on the ballot prince ali bin alhussein of jordan , one of the newer administrators within asia , has also declared his candidacy and is more likely to garner the minimum five supporters but the power brokers of his own continent sheik salman bin ibrahim alkhalifa , the bahraini who heads the asian soccer confederation , and sheik ahmad alfahad alsabah , the kuwaiti who is the president of the olympic council of asia are backing blatter their influence will weigh heavily against prince ali , meaning that at the very least asia s votes will be split during the fifa presidential election blatter is assured of mass support from africa , not the least because of the continued dependence of many african federations on the substantial , and legitimate , payouts that blatter and his predecessor jo o havelange have doled out from world cup profits between them , africa and asia can deliver close to the majority needed to win the election at the end of may europe will be divided , which is one reason michel platini , the uefa president , is not running for the fifa role even though he has openly said it is time for change at the top platini , a frenchman , brings to the sport the real experience of having played at the highest level a surprise candidate david ginola , also of france has thrown his name into the ring , though his aspirations need to be taken with a grain of salt ginola was an exciting player before he retired in 2002 , a winger who could get people out of their seats with his sorcery on the ball he oozed gallic charm too , and had no shortage of offers to be a fashion model he advertised shampoo , briefly starred in movies and regularly appears on tv the frenchman insists he has been working for months on nine fresh initiatives that he will unveil this week and that he is serious about taking the responsibility to lead and to change fifa the first proposal , ginola announced monday , would be to make fifa pay taxes on its sizable profits it is incredible , and wrong , he said in wales , where he stumped for support from its football association , that fifa takes 4 billion from the wold cup and gives nothing back to brazil in terms of administrative experience or time spent with the federations whose trust he now seeks , ginola is a novice he has two things going for him charm and the platform given him by paddy power , the publicityhungry irish betting company that promised to pay him 250 , 000 british pounds , about 375 , 000 , up front to run in the election blatter has had little to smile about of late , but champagne s struggle to gain a handful of supporters for his numerous reforms , the discomfort with prince ali among those in his continental association , and the gimmickry surrounding ginola s celebrity entry might lighten the incumbent president s mood any other contenders \? nominations remain open until jan 29 , and harold maynenicholls is mulling whether to run maynenicholls has the handson experience and fifa contacts that the others lack he used to be the chilean soccer federation president , and he toured the world as head of the fifa inspection commission that assessed all of the bidders for the 2018 and 2022 world cups that were awarded to russia and qatar , respectively it is fair to say that maynenicholls s conclusions got about as much consideration as michael j garcia s investigation into potential corruption in the world cup bidding process england was highly praised on all counts before the 2018 bid , yet russia won the vote handily maynenicholls s report also spelled out the problems with qatar , most notably the heat yet the middle eastern state was awarded the 2022 world cup tournament that must now , fifa admits , be moved to the cooler winter months for the safety of players and spectators alike fifa is still wrestling with when to stage that event , the one certainty being that it will not be in the junejuly period designated for it when the bidding took place maynenicholls is due to address the brussels summit meeting prince ali and ginola have been invited to speak , but are not expected to do so none of the six corporate partners of fifa adidas , cocacola , gazprom , hyundai , sony and visa is scheduled to appear at the summit meeting nor is blatter expected in brussels he is probably already working on his acceptance speech for another fouryear term in office
cairo conducted an airstrike against an islamist stronghold in on monday in retaliation for the beheading of at least a dozen egyptian christians by a local franchise of the islamic state , in cairo s deepest reach yet into the chaos that has engulfed its neighbor hinting at possible further action , president abdel fattah elsisi of said in a statement that he had convened a continuous session of his national defense council to monitor events in and to weigh additional measures but the strike itself , hitting in the libyan town of derna at dawn , was a new turn in the breakdown of regional order in the aftermath of the arab spring revolts and the islamic state s emergence nearly three and a half years after the ouster of col muammar elqaddafi , two rival coalitions of militias are battling for control over libya and its vast resources , including nearly 100 billion in financial reserves , untapped oil deposits , and a long mediterranean coast facing europe in the absence of any effective government or even a dominant force , a multifaceted proxy war has erupted as rival arab states back competing militias and extremist groups like al qaeda and the islamic state seek to expand their operations mr sisi , a former general who led the ouster of egypt s islamist president in 2013 , has watched with growing concern as a coalition of moderate islamists , extremists and regional militias seized control of the libyan capital , tripoli , last year and set up their own provisional government together with the united arab emirates , mr sisi has covertly backed a rival coalition that has coalesced around a libyan general s campaign to drive out the islamist and regional militias last summer , egypt provided bases for jets from the united arab emirates to launch at least two airstrikes against islamist forces in tripoli , western officials have said , although neither country has publicly acknowledged its role egypt s strikes on monday now threaten to drag it deeper into libya s messy internal conflict at a time when cairo is already straining to revive a battered economy and suppress its own domestic islamist insurgency centered in the sinai peninsula but now also fighting under the banner of the islamic state in this new theater , egypt is highly vulnerable to potential counterattacks by islamist forces , in part because of its long and porous desert border with libya , but also because of the continued presence of large numbers of egyptian citizens inside libya egyptian workers often seek jobs in oilrich libya , and a spokesman for the egyptian foreign ministry said monday that hundreds of thousands remained inside the country for its part , the islamic state may consider egypt s entry into the libyan battle a strategic success , analysts said , in part because the extremists seek to capitalize on the spreading chaos they want to stretch the egyptian military because they are fighting in the sinai , too , said , a researcher at the washington institute for near east policy who tracks the group he argued that the extremists would rally local support against egypt s military interference especially if its airstrikes hit civilians but also that the islamic state had built its ideology on cultivating such enemies they see it as proof that god is on their side , that even as all these forces are arrayed against us , we are remaining and expanding , ' as their saying goes , he said this is red meat for their base of supporters a similar dynamic unfolded this month when jordan carried out days of bombing raids against the islamic state in syria in retaliation for its videotaped burning to death of a captured jordanian pilot egyptian militants , including the selfproclaimed sinai province of the islamic state , have killed hundreds of soldiers and policemen in the 18 months since mr sisi took power they killed as many as three dozen egyptians in one night of coordinated bombings at the end of january but the events that led to egypt s bombing on monday began several weeks ago with the disappearance of about 20 egyptian christians working in the midcoastal libyan city of surt fighters identifying themselves as the tripolitania province of the islamic state adopting the name of one of the three traditional provinces based on ottomanera divisions released a photograph last month showing that they had captured the egyptian crusaders then on sunday night , the media arm of the central islamic state group released a video headlined a message signed with blood to the nation of the cross , which appeared to show at least a dozen of those hostages being paraded along a rocky mediterranean beach in western libya all wore orange jumpsuits and were escorted by a row of masked fighters dressed in black with ceremonial knives at their chests details identical to previous islamic state videos after a short speech delivered in fluent english by the lead executioner , the fighters forced their captives to the ground , sawed through their necks and let their blood darken the waves in a televised address later sunday night , mr sisi declared that egypt preserves the right to respond , in the appropriate manner and timing , to exact retribution in state news media reports issued monday around 8 30 am , the egyptian military said its f16 fighters had struck camps , training facilities and weapons depots belonging to the islamic state in libya a statement from the military called the attack a response to the criminal acts of terrorist elements and organizations inside and outside the country we stress that revenge for the blood of egyptians , and retribution from the killers and criminals , is a right we must dutifully enforce , the military said , and egyptian state television showed footage of the f16s taking off in the dark as the statement was read on the air the military statement did not disclose the location of the strikes but a foreign ministry spokesman , badr abdelatty , later confirmed news reports that the jets had hit derna , libya , where some of the local islamist fighters have declared themselves the barqa province of the islamic state although far from tripolitania province , where the islamic state group that killed the egyptian christians is from , derna is close enough to the border for egypt s jets to reach it easily without having to refuel en route western officials , speaking on the condition of anonymity , noted that none of the three islamic state provinces were open or visible enough to easily target , suggesting that even a prolonged campaign of airstrikes might do little harm to the groups but the strikes drew applause from libya s internationally recognized government , which relocated from the capital around the time it was taken over by an islamistallied militia and now sits near the egyptian border in a town under the protection of gen khalifa hifter , who is leading the fight against the islamists egypt has helped us as we requested , col saqer aljoroshi , a commander under general hifter , said by telephone in an interview with an egyptian television network mr joroshi estimated that the strikes had killed not less than 40 or 50 people the islamistallied coalition , which calls itself libya dawn and has established a provisional government in tripoli , sought to deny that the islamic state executions had taken place , reinforcing criticisms that the coalition willingly collaborates with such violent extremists in a statement , the libya dawn government dismissed the execution video as a hollywood film contrived by its opponents it called mr sisi a terrorist criminal and murderer and charged that the egyptian airstrikes in derna had killed civilians \( mr joroshi said no civilians had been killed his assertion could not be verified \) in what was apparently a threat , the same statement also warned all egyptians to leave libya within 48 hours to preserve their safety from any revenge attacks mr abdelatty , the foreign ministry spokesman , said egypt had established an emergency consular services center to help egyptians caught inside libya get to safe havens or return to egypt the united states and its allies have tried to draw the libyan factions into negotiations to form a unity government and dissuade them from demanding the complete military defeat of their opponents before any such talks western officials have previously argued that military escalations such as egypt s bombing on monday pose obstacles to a negotiated , political solution , but some have also acknowledged egypt s right to respond to an attack on its civilians a state department representative declined to comment in a statement , mr sisi said he had sent egypt s foreign minister to new york and washington to ensure that the international community lives up to its responsibilities , because libya had now become a threat to international peace and security
ritchie coster is just as much in the dark about true detective as the rest of us even though he plays austin chessani , the corrupt , ofteninebriated mayor of vinci , calif , in hbo s hardboiled drama , the 48yearold londonborn actor was given only the first three scripts when he signed on for the series beyond that , he saw only the scenes in which his character appears a lot about it was a mystery , mr coster said i don t want to say they were being obtuse , but it was the most secrecy i ve ever encountered that s saying something , considering mr coster has worked on such closely guarded projects as the dark knight and the blacklist mr coster spoke about playing a drunk , doing american accents and getting typecast as a villain these are edited excerpts of the conversation did you base the character of mayor chessani on any politicians in particular \? i did watch a ton of california politicians on youtube they were all interesting for various reasons , but none of them seemed to do the job he s a very specific type he s drunk all the time i couldn t find anyone similar on youtube , so mostly he just popped out of my imagination what s the secret to playing a convincing drunk \? it s kind of a truism among actors i remember being told this when i was training that the way to appear drunk is to try and be sober it does make sense you re always trying to speak properly , stand up straight , keep your act together so when you re acting it , you put a little extra pronunciation on the words , a little more deliberation with the gestures , try to keep your eyes wide open were you worried about going over the top \? i was very scared about going too far acting drunk is a tricky one you re skating on thin ice you re in danger of looking like a stagey drunk i had to rely on the director to tell me if i could go further i had this dark fantasy in my head that everyone else was doing beautiful , serious , nuanced work , and along comes the big british ham to screw up the whole thing i haven t watched it yet i m saving it for a binge watch so i m not entirely too sure that didn t happen so what were actually drinking \? just water did you stay in character between takes \? i try to do that every job i do , and it lasts about 17 minutes i get bored , or i see something shiny and all of a sudden i m myself again is it fun to play such a sleazy character \? yes he s not as bad as the characters i usually play i often play the bad guy a terrorist or a serial killer this guy s a drunk mayor that s pretty gentle on my scale do you get offended that you re so often cast as villains \? i don t know what it is i ve got this irish potato face i bridle against it sometimes , because i d love to play the lead in a romantic comedy but i have to poke myself sharply and remind myself it s work who s to complain , because those roles are always so much fun \? was there a specific regional dialect you were going for \? i was doing a standard american accent , perhaps opened up a little bit for the west coast i ve played russians , afghans , and chechens , but far and away the hardest one to get is the american accent i ve lived here for 20 years , and i grew up on americana it s a sound i m used to hearing , but for many years , it eluded me chessani s accent was a hell of a lot of hard work you ve played so many american characters are people surprised to learn you re british \? every now and again , that happens , and it makes my year do you strive to be a physical chameleon as well \? absolutely when i m feeling cynical about myself , i call myself a facialhair actor i change my facialhair configuration for every role but when i m a little more optimistic about myself , i grant that it s a little more difficult than that i take pride in it i think it s important otherwise you re just a talking head you worked with another very stylized writer , david milch , on hbo s shortlived horse racing drama luck how does his dialogue compare with nic pizzolatto s on true detective \? i ve got a worm seye view , but the approach is the same when you get a line from milch or nic , you go , well , nobody s ever spoken like that how am i going to say that \? sometimes all you can do it try to get the intention right , close your eyes , lay back , think of england and give it your best shot it s invariably wellwritten , so the rhythm s going to establish itself were you disappointed when luck was suddenly canceled because horses had died on the set \? it was hard we were a tight group , and we were all proud of what we were doing it was much more than a job it was heartbreaking for everyone , and some people still feel the pain of it but to tell you the truth , it was inevitable that was going to happen , just because of the nature of horse racing horses die it s an uncomfortable truth it happened sooner rather than later there are portraits of mayor chessani all over his mansion were you able to keep any \? i wish i could ve there are also photographs of me with every recent president they worked really hard to create there s a great one right behind my desk of me with bush the younger , and our arms are around each other i wanted that so badly , ironically speaking of course expectations were so high for season 2 of true detective have you tried to shield yourself from the reaction \? i ve tried , because it doesn t do me any good if the response is positive , then i m going to get smug and if it s negative , i ll be filled with selfrecrimination but it s hard to shield yourself
sticking my hands between the cushions , i blindly dig through the maze of lint and mashedup cracker pieces coming up empty handed , i start to pick at the thin layer of dust that has collected beneath my fingernails nervously , i start on my cuticles as well , as i often do when i am stressed does anyone ever imagine their lives turning out this way \? i slowly calculate my findings in my head still a little short , i tackle the closets a row of coats greets me like a treasure hunter , i start on my task each pocket holds an assortment of treasures and sticky surprises among the lollipop sticks and crumpled tissues , i find spare change , and maybe a misplaced dollar or two at my feet , the floor is littered with overturned pocketbooks i have created a mess faster and more efficiently than the most mischievous toddler it started with a request for cookies and turned into the realization that we needed milk it would be three more days before my husband s paycheck hits our account i need almost 4 for a gallon of milk a package of cookies will run me from 2 to 3 the last time i opened my wallet , i found an old receipt and two pennies bending down , my hands turn into huge sieves , separating the good from the bad i pick up the crumpled receipts from when i hadn t a care in the world not long ago , i took money for granted i expected it to always be there trips to the mall are a thing of the past the necessities take precedence these days it is amazing how life can be turned upside down in such a short period of time we were confident in our decision to have a large family we never expected my husband s sixfigure salary to disappear instead , quicker than you can say the word downsizing , it was gone a long year of unemployment depleted all our savings , as well as the money put away for retirement my husband took a new position with a huge pay cut , and freelance writing doesn t pay the bills sure , most families can get through this scenario once it is much harder when unemployment strikes three times in a short period of time slowly , the things i thought i couldn t do without have turned into extras the school pictures i proudly hung on my walls no longer get purchased , including the graduation pictures i waited eighteen years to display i dread opening folders at the beginning of the school year second and third notices requesting class party money sit on my countertop for weeks , while i stress over the ability to have a birthday celebration for my child if i am lucky enough to have an extra 10 in my purse that week , i can buy a gift or a special treat instead , begrudgingly , i place the money in an envelope and send it off with my smiling child , proud to be doing as she is told no rolls off my tongue so easily these days sad to say , for the most part , my children are used to it in spite of their acceptance , my heart still breaks when i can t send money in for the book fair next year will be better is the mantra i keep repeating over and over i focus on proactively turning around this situation , because i cannot keep wandering around this purgatory without an end in sight i send out more r sum s than i can count hundreds of offers of a penny a word come in , but there are only so many hours in a day i write all day while the children are at school and continue into the evening after they fall asleep still , i barely earn enough to fill my gas tank each day is a lesson in wants versus needs some days the wants pile up and suffocate me it is then that i have to take a step back and appreciate all that we do have eight little , and not so little , heads around my dinner table give me reason to persevere i see hope in every keystroke i make i recognize the possibility with every r sum my husband sends our future is being built with each step we take forward we will reclaim the life we left behind , except this time , we will not take it for granted our struggle remains hidden to those around us we live in a beautiful treelined neighborhood from the outside , our home does not appear any different from the others we may not have the latest and the greatest , but none of that matters in the larger scheme of things my children take quite a bit of flack because of their lack of technology and smartphones , but they have survived nonetheless thankfully , there is no way to tell the difference between a ropostale handmedowns and those bought at the department store my husband and i walk a tightrope in a constant balancing act trying to figure out if we should pay the phone bill or put gas in the car surely , we are not the only ones trying to stay afloat in the current economy , but i cannot tell who is walking a path similar to ours suburban poverty does not jump out and slap you in the face it is the silent stigma we carry with us

greece isn t the only debt crisis boiling over right now there s also puerto rico , which i was aware was brewing but wasn t tracking carefully i ll probably have a fair bit to say about the pr crisis once i get back from my current trip , but meanwhile a few notes clearly , puerto rico s troubles run much deeper than government debt , and there has been a lot of discussion about its underlying economic weakness however , not much of the discussion seems to ask what seems to me to be an obvious question what , exactly , should an economy in puerto rico s position be doing \? puerto rico does , of course , have warm winters and beaches but so do a number of places , and it s a much bigger and more populous place than its neighbors with a much smaller ratio of coastline to area or population and is hence not as wellplaced to have a tourismcentered economy indeed , it has historically grown largely as a center for manufacturing , especially in pharma , encouraged by special tax breaks but why manufacture there \? there are various ways to develop a competitive advantage in manufacturing you can have a unique skill base , like much of germany you can have very low wages , like a number of emerging asian economies or you can have a logistical advantage due to being close to major markets , like a fair bit of what remains of us manufacturing or , these days , the export belt in northern mexico puerto rico , however , has none of these it doesn t have a special skill complex its wages are low by mainland standards , but not that low \( and as i ll argue in a moment , can t go that low \) and while it s close to the mainland as the crow flies , it s fairly slow and expensive to ship things in and out in a fundamental sense , it s not that easy to see why there should be a sizable economy on that island in that location now , you might argue that this is just an argument for big wage cuts but puerto rico is part of the united states , and its residents are us citizens this tends to put a floor under wages , in several ways the new york fed http www newyorkfed org outreachandeducation puertorico 2014 reportmain html emphasizes the effects of the federal minimum wage and relatively generous federal safetynet programs \( given low productivity \) that may cause people to choose exit from the work force in the face of low wages but even without that , the relative ease of emigration would tend to support wages put it this way if a region of the united states turns out to be a relatively bad location for production , we don t expect the population to maintain itself by competing via ultralow wages we expect workingage residents to leave for more favorable places that s what you see in poor mainland states like west virginia , which actually looks a fair bit like puerto rico in terms of low labor force participation , albeit not quite so much so \( mississippi and alabama also have low participation \) and outmigration need not be such a terrible thing there is much discussion of what s wrong with puerto rico , but maybe we should , at least some of the time , just think of puerto rico as an ordinary region of the us at any given time , we expect some regions to be in relative and maybe even absolute decline , as the winds of technology and global trade shift i wonder , in particular , whether puerto rico is suffering from the forces that seem to be leading to a general shortening of logistical chains and the reshoring of manufacturing to advanced economies now , this can lead to problems of governance puerto rico benefits a lot from federal programs , but it does have to pay for a lot of stuff itself , and emigration of workers undermines revenue while leaving many of the costs of serving the remaining population , notably the elderly , unchanged but i d argue for paying a lot of attention to the nonspecific forces affecting the island , and in particular the economic geography side puerto rico may to an important extent just suffer from being a slightly hard to reach island in a time when corporations place a high premium on easy , justintime shipments
samuel dubose was a 43yearold unarmed black man who was shot in the head and killed by a university of cincinnati police officer , ray tensing , during a traffic stop a few blocks from campus tensing stopped dubose on july 19 because his car did n't have a front license plate some say dubose s face was blown off on wednesday , tensing was indicted on murder charges as the hamilton county prosecutor , joe deters , said wednesday , tensing purposefully killed dubose this is without question a murder deters a chicken crap stop , tensing s recounting of the events that led to the shooting nonsense , and the shooting itself the most asinine act i 've ever seen a police officer make authorities also released tensing s disturbing of the stop and shooting in an exchange with the dispatcher just after the shooting , tensing said i'm not injured i almost got ran over by the car he took off on me i discharged one round , struck the man in the head indeed , the about the shooting repeats and even amplifies that claim it reads officer tensing stated that he almost was run over by the driver of the honda accord and was forced to shoot the driver with his duty weapon it continues officer tensing stated that he fired a single shot officer tensing repeated that he was being dragged by the vehicle and had to fire his weapon the video proves that none of that happened to watch that video is to be witness to an execution what kind of person takes another person s life so cavalierly \? how little must an officer think of the person at the other end of the barrel to shoot him in the head when , per the video , there appears to be no threat \? that an annual review of tensing described him as extremely proactive with traffic enforcement the nbc news report continued it was unclear whether that was meant to be high praise or an indication that he was overzealous in his policing but a supervisor said the officer , ray tensing , only meets the standards when it comes to community service , ' according to records released by the university the supervisor wrote that tensing should interact with the public more outside of traffic enforcement to improve his demeanor he joined the university police force a year ago and was generally well rated in his reviews there are some blessings in this tragedy the bodycam video was vital , and refuted the officer s account also , the prosecutor moved quickly to charge the officer in the case but , even those steps in the right direction are not fully restorative body cameras must be made mandatory countrywide that will help with investigations after the fact , and may indeed alter behavior , but there is no full equipment fix for a personnel problem what is happening between police officers and people of color in this country is a structural issue and must be deconstructed as such cameras wo n't change basic character this incident adds to a drumbeat of falling black bodies after interactions with police officers it adds to distrust about officers' accounts of what leads to these deaths it adds to a corrosion of trust in the entire criminal justice system police violence may not be the greatest threat of violence to black lives community violence , sadly , surpasses it but the disproportionate use of force by some officers against black and brown people does appear to be a specific and very real threat that must be addressed and the very idea that this violence is conducted by people acting as an arm of government , in your name but against your body , is too hard a pill to swallow how can my taxes pay your salary while your actions drain blood from my body \? how is it that i have to be afraid of cops as well as criminals \? whom do i turn to when the cops become the criminals \? how often must we hear the lamentations for justice emanate from dark faces streaked with tears and burning with a righteous rage \? something has to give the carnage must be abated trust must be restored what we are living through cannot continue people cannot long shoulder this weight nor should they be required to police and criminal justice reform has to be a priority in our political actions now , and into the future we cannot wait for interpersonal racial reconciliation to act to legally remedy systemic racial inequities as the rev dr martin luther king jr once put it it may be true that the law cannot make a man love me , but it can keep him from lynching me , and i think that s pretty important there simply must be more protections for citizens in these cases there must be ! this environment of death and distrust is a threat to the fabric of society and to democracy itself
bradenton , fla jalen carethers , four weeks removed from his final game as a basketball player at radford , was at a loss sports had always come easily to him , but now he was standing in the middle of a multipurpose field at img academy , cradling an oblong ball in his hands and doing his best to figure out how to make this foreign object fly where on the foot do you want to hit it \? he asked michael ablett , a national talent manager for the australian football league , advised carethers to snap his leg and make contact with his forefoot the idea , or at least the hope , was to keep his foot stiff so that he would generate enough force to send the ball end over end on a smooth parabola all right , ablett said as he took a few generous steps in the general direction of safety , let s have a bit of a go at it a steady rain began to fall carethers took a deep breath , squared his 6foot7 frame and dropkicked the ball , which wobbled toward the sky with the ferocity of a bat trapped in an attic it was , if nothing else , a start spot on , ablett said ablett was one of several officials from the afl who gathered here late last month for a threeday scouting combine that was unconventional the prospects on hand \? fifteen college basketball players , most of whom had never even heard of australian rules football until they were contacted just weeks ahead of the event but suddenly , and unexpectedly , they were here tackling and running , blocking and kicking \( sort of \) as scouts , coaches and executives sought to discover the league s next great ruckman we do n't produce these types of athletes , said nick byrne , a scout with the north melbourne kangaroos they do n't exist the combine was a sign of just how far the afl is willing to go in search of untapped talent , particularly when it comes to identifying prospects who can excel as ruckmen an important position and one in which it helps to be very tall , very athletic and very tall \( did we mention tall \? \) i told a couple of my teammates that i was coming out for this , and they were like , whoa , what \? ' said , a 6foot9 senior at arizona ruckmen vie for the ball after stoppages , typically when it is thrown back into play or when an umpire bounces it high off the turf after goals each ruckman attempts to control possession by tapping the ball out to a teammate jonathan givony , a basketball scout and consultant who first organized the annual united states combine in 2012 , likened it to a jump ball except there are 60 to 70 jump balls per game , said givony , who makes mental notes of potential targets throughout the college basketball season in other words , everything starts with the ruckmen so size matters , and there is again , pardon the expression an apparent shortage of people suitable for the position among the 23 million residents of australia only a handful of players drafted each year measure 6 feet 6 or taller , said kevin sheehan , the league s national and international talent manager all 15 athletes at the combine in florida were at least 66 , a smorgasbord of verticality that many of the players had been benchwarmers at basketball programs like nebraska , penn state and florida atlantic mattered little to those who watched korcheck , for example , played sparingly at arizona last season , averaging 12 points a game you ca n't expect them to pick up the skills of the game straightaway , said mathew capuano , a development coach for carlton football club and a former ruckman what you 're looking for are the little things they might do , and how quickly they 're able to improve as capuano watched korcheck and the others work on their passing during the combine s second day , a camera crew for australian television arrived to film the event when we did this stuff yesterday , the ball was going all over the place , capuano said but you can see that they 're actually starting to move it around now it was universally understood that three days provided a narrow window to gauge potential but there were subtle and notsosubtle indicators korcheck seemed to assert himself as the alpha male whenever he stepped onto the field and carethers s time of 279 seconds for the 20meter dash placed him in the top percentile of prospects who had ever been tested by the league after an hourlong psychological assessment , carethers stopped for a refreshment at a smoothie king kiosk on img academy s sprawling campus he spotted chris walker , a former player at florida who had declared for the , as walker was leaving the gymnasium they did not really know each other , but they exchanged pleasantries anyway just basketball etiquette , carethers explained if any of the combine attendees was resistant to the notion that it was time to let his hoop dreams die , givony offered perspective for the hundreds of players who leave college each year , about 150 decent jobs in pro basketball are up for grabs , he said about 45 of the jobs will go to college players selected in the , and another 100 to 120 college players will sign attractive contracts overseas what are the rest of them going to do \? asked givony , who runs the website i'm talking about the guys who average 5 points and 5 rebounds , guys who are role players those qualities actually translate well to what we 're looking for here guys who know how to set screens , are physical , can play defense and hustle we 're not looking for stars , a senior who averaged 58 points a game at south dakota last season , was one of two prospects originally from australia he recalled his initial email from givony his first words were something like , you 're going to think i'm crazy but , ' hunter said i mean , i'm australian , and i 'd never considered this australian rules football requires a unique blend of endurance \( players can expect to run upward of eight miles each game \) and strength \( fans are often treated to more than 100 tackles per contest \) and while the ruckman s primary duty is to win those allimportant center bounces , he must be deft enough with his hands to pass the ball and speedy enough to run with it , too there is nowhere to hide in this sport , givony said those who prove their mettle are well compensated , sheehan said , with the average afl salary at 300 , 000 australian dollars \( about 240 , 000 \) many of the league s top stars earn more than a million australian dollars \( 800 , 000 \) , and teams are eager to invest in athletes with great potential most contracts are guaranteed for at least two seasons and there was tangible proof for korcheck and the others that these jobs are real three former basketball players who were discovered at past combines are under contract with afl franchises , who played at depaul , who played at morehead state and , a former walkon at oklahoma state who was signed by collingwood football club after an impressive showing last year the most recent combine was a mix of instruction and audition , equal parts tutorial and job interview when carethers learned that byrne , the north melbourne scout , and cameron joyce , the list manager for north melbourne , wanted to meet with him and ask him additional questions , his roommate , daquan holiday , became excited yo ! said holiday , a senior at the new jersey institute of technology let me get half of that contract ! i need new shoes ! james johnson , a 69 forward who played for virginia , san diego state and liberty during his peripatetic college career , also met with joyce and byrne their questions ranged from whether johnson would have reservations about moving to australia \( none at all \) , to what he considered the most challenging part of the combine \( kicking \) , to whether he had ever gotten into any trouble \( accidentally broke some gym equipment in middle school \) , to how he felt he stacked up to the other players \( holding his own \) when johnson was asked how he would cope with the physical nature of the sport , he said that his habit of getting into foul trouble as a basketball player might serve him well in the afl he never could have expected that his propensity for hacking opponents could potentially land him a job in australia from what i 've seen , johnson said , it s a game for warriors , and that s kind of like who i am later , the entire group reconvened inside a large conference room for a video presentation on ruckwork the finer points of the position getting your hands on the ball first directing it to a teammate chasing ground balls tackling and blocking joyce showed a clip of a player leaping for a pass christian behrens , a former forward at california , spoke up so , jumping on someone s back , he said , that s a technique that s taught \? the short answer was yes the next afternoon , as the combine was wrapping up , the talk among the scouts over lunch was about korcheck , who had been impressive in a short scrimmage that morning he might have been playing the wrong sport all this time , said chris green , a scout for richmond football club well , givony said , he might be playing the right one pretty soon ablett stood to address the players he thanked them for their effort and for their willingness to try something new at least two of them , he said , would be invited to melbourne for a monthlong tryout with the league in the fall but if teams were to express interest before then , they were free to sign contracts as korcheck headed to his room to pack up , he still seemed to be absorbing it all he always figured he would find a job in tucson after graduating this month but now , who knows \? i did n't know what i was doing out there , he said but it felt good
this is one in focusing on new yorkcentric movies having their premieres at the tribeca film festival much has been written about the work , and humor , of cartoonists for the new yorker but the process of how those cartoons come to be published , and the collection of intriguing personalities behind the drawings , had yet to receive a bigscreen documentary feature treatment in very semiserious , the filmmaker leah wolchok follows the new yorker cartoon editor bob mankoff through the selection process and interviews several of the publication s longtime contributors george booth , mort gerberg , roz chast they are joined by emerging artists like liana finck , farley katz and ed steed  the film also peeks into the weekly open office hours of the cartoon department , where artists can submit their work directly to mr mankoff , receiving instant criticism or praise in the process very semiserious had its world premiere sunday at the tribeca film festival , and has three more screenings this week during an interview in new york , ms wolchok , 37 , spoke about how she sought to portray the cartoons and cartoonists on screen below are excerpts from that conversation you had so many cartoonists to choose from how did you go about figuring out who to talk to \? part of it was looking at the cartoons i liked and finding those people but another part of it was that i was really looking for the multigenerational story i was looking for people who had been around for a really long time who were at the end of their careers and looking back on their legacy at the new yorker and i was looking for people at their peak , like roz chast , who will always be on top and then i was looking for people who were at the very beginning of their career when i first met matt diffee in 2008 , he was called the rising star by a few different publications the degree of racial diversity in the world of cartoonists for the new yorker , and subsequently for your film , is low did you seek out diversity making the movie \? it was something that intrigued me from the beginning to meet a group of people this large that was so homogenous especially coming out of a san francisco liberal consciousness and looking at an institution so well respected , how could it be that they re still so homogenous all i know is that the community that you see on screen is the community that exists at the new yorker how did you go about choosing the cartoons to show and how to show them onscreen \? there were cartoons that were interesting because they were thematically relevant to the scene and then , it s a tricky thing because it s an art form that s meant to be appreciated in flipping through a magazine to have something work onscreen is a totally different experience the way someone gets a cartoon is you look at the image , you look down at the caption and you look back at the image and you get it the new yorker has done studies that your pupil dilates in the moment that you get the cartoon thinking about that , we knew that we had to present the cartoon in such a way that we re forcing you to look where we want you to look so that you get it when we say that you should so we zoom out in certain places or we pan right or left , or do the caption first there are ways we ve guided you in the best way to help you get it in the context of the movie have you always been a fan of the new yorker \? i didn t grow up with the new yorker i discovered it in college because of the fiction i was interested in writing and then i got into the cartoons how did you want to use new york in the film \? we shot a lot of street scenes because we were looking for everyday moments that happen on the streets of new york that could be turned into new yorker cartoons you could put a new yorker cartoonist on any street corner and have them observe what s happening and they would see things that none of the rest of us would see any quintessential new york moments to share \? we were filming a new yorker softball game against gq in central park right before the game started and we were waiting at the benches , a woman stuck her dog in the water fountain and started washing the dog s bottom in the water fountain she was basically using the water fountain like a doggie bidet this happened as we were filming our cartoonist on the bench waiting for the softball game to begin to me , that kind of , i don t care what anyone else thinks or what other person is gonna be using this water fountain , i m gonna take care of my needs right now attitude , that kind of thing could only happen in new york
the boys are each wielding a baseball bat , running back and forth across the backyard they pause at the slide , fake scream at the sight of a bug and bring the bats down with resounding thuds they realize they have missed the bug for the 47th time in a row and they take off running again , their squeals filling the late afternoon air of our neighborhood one of them is my 4yearold biological son , ryan the other is my 3yearold foster son , whom we call bluejay bluejay comes running toward me and stops abruptly in front of me the may pennsylvania sun is shining down on him , and he is laughing so hard that his shoulders are shaking and he is gasping for breath i smile at him i tell him he s silly i think you almost weren t here we almost never knew you none of this might have ever happened maybe it still won t  two years ago , i was a fulltime working mother in phoenix with a toddler who spent more hours in daycare than i spent in the office just before ryan s second birthday , around the time we started crunching numbers to determine whether we could afford the daycare bill for a second baby , mike learned his company would be downsizing we took the news as a sign after almost a decade in the desert where we had met , married and had a baby it was time for us to move back east , to raise ryan near our families in ohio and pennsylvania hypothetical child no 2 would have to wait  the boys sit at the kitchen table one is painting a picture of a tiger , the other is making blue playdoh spaghetti i am pulled this way to pour more paint , then that way to open more playdoh containers back this way to wipe up spilled paint , back that way for a conversation on how playdoh stays on the table and out of the mouth i am learning how to parent two children at once , and i feel endlessly torn i become obsessed with lavishing individual attention on the one who has always had it , to ensure he doesn t feel replaced , and equal attention on the one who probably never had enough of it , to ensure he feels as if he belongs  it took a full year s worth of job hunting from phoenix , as well as a few months of outofsuitcaseliving at my inlaws house , before we settled into our new east coast home at the same time , ryan turned 3 years old and began displaying all the classic characteristics that make that age so notoriously frustrating we began joking how at this rate , ryan might be an only child forever the more we said it , the less it sounded like a joke we were exhausted i began quietly sorting through all the baby clothes i had so meticulously packed away in phoenix i gave them away to friends or to goodwill baby fever had long since passed  we walk into the birthday party , balancing gifts and dishes in our arms our boys run ahead of us , darting for the giant trampoline bluejay stops in front of the first person he sees , the father of an invitee , a perfect stranger he hugs the dad , saying , i got sunscream on me ! alright , buddy ! that s great , the dad says as he hugs him back it s the first time we ve introduced him to our friends , and they instantly love him they spend the rest of the afternoon telling us how well he fits in and how they can t believe how attached to me he already has become i respond by explaining that nothing is certain that we love bluejay but we don t know where things will go how there is a process , a history how a lot could happen before we know more they sigh and they nod they place reassuring hands on our arms it feels as if we re celebrating and holding our breath at the same time  the more time passed , the more we knew we didn t want to start over with another brand new baby still , we felt like we had room in our hearts for another child we couldn t shake the desire for ryan to grow up with a sibling we had talked for years about how maybe , someday , we would adopt we toyed with the idea of international adoption , but the cost and travel requirements were major hurdles we couldn t leap our answer seemed obvious foster care we spent half a year preparing we attended training sessions , we filled out paperwork , and we decorated our third bedroom in the most genderneutral , ageneutral way possible we prepared , and then we waited  i manage to sneak ryan away for a couple of hours over the weekend just us it feels hauntingly familiar but also strangely like i m forgetting something i listen intently to every story he tells me i laugh at all his jokes i soak him up but i can t help myself i have to ask him do you like having bluejay live with us \? oh sure , he says he s fun to play with is he going to be my brother \? well , we don t know yet he s going to stay with us for a long time but i m not sure if he ll be able to stay forever i hope he stays forever because i love him i know , buddy , i tell him me too
re , by adam grant \( sunday review , sept 6 \) workplace friendships are valuable not only for the organization but also for the people who are able to cultivate them friendships with senior executives can help jumpstart a junior employee s career unfortunately , my research indicates that there is one type of friendship that is discouraged in the office , and that is friendships with the opposite sex invite a samesex colleague to join you for a starbucks run or beer after work , and nobody blinks an eye invite an oppositesex colleague to join you , and rumors can fly , or sexual harassment allegations can surface since men still run most of our organizations , some of the most valuable work friends are men if women have a harder time befriending senior male executives , it will naturally affect their careers we obviously need to maintain appropriate boundaries between men and women at work , but we also need to encourage male and female coworkers to socialize more it s good for the organization , and it s necessary if women are going to reach parity with men at work kim elsesser pasadena , calif  adam grant is right that people do not generally find friends among their coworkers these days i would add a couple of other reasons that were not included in his article lack of time and dogeatdog competition some of us baby boomers recall a time when we actually had time to strike up a relatively long conversation with a coworker during work hours , or go to the company cafeteria or a restaurant at noon for lunch and conversation with our work friends it has been many years since we have had time to do either of these things now , conversation is a quick how are things \? as we pass in the hall , and lunch is at our desks alone with work also , the tone in many offices is not as friendly or as familylike as it was decades ago workers today are in a more competitive environment where they are not sure whom they can trust and so choose not to get beyond the basic niceties and short conversations with coworkers they keep to themselves and withhold information , just to be safe rebecca fahrlander bellevue , neb adam grant writes , the sociologist max weber classically argued that the protestant reformation had a peculiar effect on american work but our calvinist legacy is n't all bad weber also wrote about the importance of vocation the use of one s gifts in service to humanity this concept gives work meaning today , managers need to convey how their staff s collective efforts can make a positive difference in people s lives in my experience , workplace friendships are still robust in the nonprofit sector just as nonprofits have benefited from adopting best practices from business , perhaps some corporations can learn from nonprofits how to create a highmorale workplace where friendships are but one outcome of a vibrant community rooted in a shared purpose marnie imhoff new york adam grant s essay about finding friends at work overlooks one of the biggest obstacles to friendship in the workplace geography my office is about 20 miles from where i live , and many of my fellow employees have to commute similar or greater distances to get to work more to the point , none of my colleagues live near me , and the closest are a good 20 to 25 minutes away under these circumstances , forming and keeping friendships outside the office is very difficult jeffrey bendix cleveland heights , ohio
charlottesville , va the police here said monday that they had found no substantive basis to support a rolling stone magazine article depicting a horrific gang rape at a fraternity house and that a fourmonth review had identified serious discrepancies in the account by a woman identified as jackie , who refused to cooperate with their investigation after a review of records and roughly 70 interviews , police chief timothy j longo sr said at a crowded news conference here , his found no evidence that a party even took place at the phi kappa psi fraternity on sept 28 , 2012 , when the rape was said to have occurred instead , he said , there was a formal that night at the house s sister sorority , making it highly unlikely that the fraternity would have had a party on the same night despite numerous attempts , he said , his officers were unable to track down the man jackie had identified as her date that night and several interviews contradicted her version of events the chief said he was suspending , but not closing , the investigation , and he left open the possibility that some kind of assault might have occurred , saying additional information could still come to light we 're not able to conclude to any substantive degree that an incident occurred at the phi kappa psi fraternity house , or any other fraternity house , for that matter , chief longo said that does n't mean something terrible did n't happen to jackie on the evening of sept 28 , 2012 we 're just not able to gather sufficient facts to determine what that is the announcement was yet another turn in a case that has shaken the university , as well as the worlds of journalism and advocates working to prevent sexual assault , since the publication in november of the 9 , 000word rolling stone article , the article , which was quickly discredited , set off a national debate about sexual assault on campus and the fraternity culture more broadly and painted one of the nation s oldest and most elite public institutions as a place where parties took precedence over learning and it came after an academic year of almost nonstop turmoil reaction on monday was swift the fraternity said it was now exploring its legal options to address the extensive damage caused by rolling stone , which it said had recklessly and prejudicially thrust the brothers of phi kappa psi into the center of a national debate the magazine has commissioned its own external review , being led by the columbia university graduate school of journalism rolling stone s managing editor , will dana , said sunday that the results would be published in the next few weeks some students took to the social media app yik yak to denounce jackie and demand that she be prosecuted , or expelled from the university , which has a strict honor code spencer gorsch , a secondyear student from charlottesville , said in an interview that jackie should perhaps face prosecution it does sound like she was very distraught and something may have happened , but i think that what she did was unacceptable on both a personal and a social level , he said , and that she greatly harmed our society by doing what she did because now it is much harder for a true rape victim whether or not jackie is a true rape victim to now come out some saw a more complex picture , saying that the uproar over the story and the steps that the university had taken since in an effort to change its culture had , in the end , raised awareness and probably done the school , and the nation , some good something happened to her , i think , said janie nelson , a firstyear student from richmond i do n't know what , but she s obviously had some issues i do n't think there s a reason to charge her for anything even if the article was n't completely true , it still brought a good point in the community and has still been important to making it a better place the rolling stone article , which , exploded here at a time when campuses around the country were already under scrutiny from the obama administration over their handling of sexual violence in virginia , gov terry mcauliffe convened a task force to combat sexual violence at the state s colleges and universities last august , several months before the rolling stone article appeared virginia s attorney general , mark r herring , chairman of the task force , said monday that it would issue a report in the next few weeks we know that sexual violence is a real problem on college campuses , mr herring said , adding , this issue will not , and should not , be pushed back into the shadows after the article appeared , the university s president , teresa a sullivan , briefly suspended fraternity activities , then imposed tough new restrictions on campus greek life beer kegs are no longer permitted during parties , security workers must be present , and at least three fraternity members in attendance must be sober during his news conference on monday , and in issued by his department , chief longo said the charlottesville police first learned of jackie in april 2014 , after an officer met with her in the company of an associate dean of students , nicole p eramo , who handles sexual assault matters one day earlier , jackie told dean eramo of the rape allegation and at that time reported a separate , unrelated physical assault but she did not want to pursue a police complaint , the chief said after the rolling stone article appeared , a detective reached out to jackie , suspecting that she was the woman he had previously interviewed since that time , despite numerous attempts to gain her cooperation , jackie' has provided no information whatsoever to investigators , the department s statement said during the course of the ensuing police investigation , the chief said , investigators interviewed nine of the 14 members who were living at the phi kappa psi fraternity house in september 2012 none said they knew jackie the authorities also sent questionnaires to other fraternity members 19 were returned , and none of the respondents said they knew jackie or had any knowledge of an assault having occurred at the fraternity house a review of bank records for the fraternity revealed no expenditures for a party the police also found a photograph timestamped sept 28 , 2012 it showed two men in an otherwise empty entrance hall , the chief said investigators also interviewed two of jackie s friends , both men , whom jackie had said met with her after the assault occurred but both contradicted her version of events , the chief said , adding , they do n't recall any physical injuries and while both said they were told by jackie that she had gone out on the night of sept 28 , 2012 , with a person named haven monahan identified in the rolling stone article as drew the police were unable to track mr monahan down many of the story s details had already been contradicted ,  despite the findings , the chief dismissed suggestions that jackie had completely fabricated her account there s a difference between a false allegation and something that happened that may be different than something that is reported in the article , the chief said all i can tell you is there is no substantive basis to conclude what is described in the article happened that night the last few months have been especially trying ones here in september , hannah graham , a secondyear student , disappeared and was later found dead three students committed suicide last fall , one in october , one in november and one in december on monday , dozens of black flags advocating suicide awareness were flying on the lawn , the main quadrangle designed by thomas jefferson , the university s founder and just last week , the campus , known to students as the grounds ,

yorkville , ill as an enthusiastic young teacher and wrestling coach at the high school here , former house speaker j dennis hastert reliably had one student at his side , former classmates say stephen reinboldt , a smart , slender , likable student who rose to become class president , was the wrestling team s equipment manager for four years , he arrived at practice early and stayed late , traveled with mr hastert to overnight tournaments , even when only one wrestler was competing , and went for long rides in the coach s sports car , sometimes driving it on friday , mr reinboldt s younger sister , jolene burdge , said her brother , who died in 1995 , was also sexually abused by mr hastert , but hid the fact for years because he thought no one would believe him mr hastert had plenty of opportunities to be alone with steve because he was there before the meets , ms burdge said on abc s he was there after everything because he did the laundry , the uniforms the allegation comes a week after mr hastert , who served for eight years as house speaker , on charges of making cash withdrawals , totaling 17 million , to evade detection by the authorities and lying to investigators two people briefed on the fbi investigation told the new york times that student hundreds of thousands of dollars to hide the fact that mr hastert sexually abused him decades ago the former student is identified in the indictment only as individual a ms burdge s comments marked the first time that a possible victim of mr hastert has been publicly identified abc reported that ms burdge said she did not ask mr hastert for money and did not know the identity of individual a at ms burdge s home in montana on friday , a man who answered the door said she was not available but the man , who did not identify himself , said her statements were accurately reported by abc mr hastert is scheduled to appear in court next week in chicago his lawyer did not return calls on friday in the interview on abc , ms burdge called mr hastert , who taught and coached at yorkville high school from 1966 until 1981 , a father figure to her brother she said she learned of the years of abuse when her brother revealed to her that he was gay eight years after he left high school i asked him , when was your first samesex experience \? ' she said he looked at me and said , it was with dennis hastert' i was stunned she continued , and he just turned around and kind of looked at me and said , who is ever going to believe me \? ' ms burdge said she believed the abuse ended when her brother moved away after his high school graduation in 1971 mr reinboldt died of aids at age 42 she also said she confronted mr hastert when he unexpectedly came to her brother s funeral , telling him , i want you to know that your secret did n't die here with my brother ms burdge said she tried for years to get news organizations , including abc news , and advocacy groups to pursue the story she began in 2006 after it was revealed that mr hastert had covered up claims that representative mark foley , a florida republican , had to congressional pages she said she had given up on exposing mr hastert then , two weeks ago , just before mr hastert was indicted , she was contacted by the fbi that s when i just kind of lost it and said , oh my god , i ca n't believe i never thought i was going to get this phone call , ' she said in interviews , former students say mr hastert was popular , partly because his classes often consisted of little more than watching movies , and because his teams kept winning he also seemed to have a new porsche almost every year , each a different color , and would let certain boys drive it not just around the parking lot , but on long rides some guys got to drive the porsche and some did n't , said jeff nix , who was a student at the time we always wondered what you had to do to get to drive the porche steve got to drive the porsche yearbooks show that mr reinboldt was a class officer every year , a member of the french and letterman s clubs , and was student council president in his senior year he was a smart kid kind of shy , but the best manager we ever had , said mr nix , who helped manage the wrestling team with mr reinboldt he always had everything ready bob dhuse , 63 , who was a star wrestler during the period when mr reinboldt was the manager , said he never saw any sort of abuse or hint of inappropriate behavior involving the coach in an interview before mr reinboldt s sister came forward , mr dhuse recalled going to the state tournament in bloomington , ill , with mr reinboldt and mr hastert in 1970 , when mr dhuse was cocaptain mr hastert drove the two students in his blue porsche he had his own hotel room , mr dhuse said , while the two teenagers shared a room he was a single guy at the time , and that s what he drove , said mr dhuse , now a corn and soybean farmer in the yorkville area , said of the coach s flashy car another member of the team around that time , gary matlock , said he went on a boy scout trip with mr reinboldt led by mr hastert to the bahamas he said mr reinboldt wanted to be part of the wrestling team but did not quite have the athletic ability , so he became a jack of all trades who assisted the coach i saw nothing except a shining example and mentor , he said of mr hastert like many who went to yorkville high school , mr matlock remained in the small farming town over the decades , he said , there had been no rumors about mr hastert this town used to be so small , he said forget 24 hours you knew all the gossip in 24 minutes but since the news of mr hastert s indictment a week ago , he said , none of mr matlock s high school friends have called to mull over the allegations it s just been a big hush , he said the community is in shock but some residents who were still absorbing the news of mr hastert s indictment said they were even more disturbed by friday s revelations i just wonder how many more of them are going to come out of the woodwork , said john toschak , an electrician , adding that many yorkville residents seemed to still support mr hastert they love him here you ca n't find anybody who would say anything bad about denny
washington the fbi director , james b comey , delivered an on thursday about the difficult relationship between the police and africanamericans , saying that officers who work in neighborhoods where blacks commit crimes at a high rate develop a cynicism that shades their attitudes about race citing the song from the broadway show avenue q , he said police officers of all races viewed black and white men differently in an address to students at georgetown university , mr comey said that some officers scrutinize africanamericans more closely using a mental shortcut that becomes almost irresistible and maybe even rational by some lights because black men are arrested at much higher rates than white men in speaking about racial issues at such length , mr comey used his office in a way that none of his predecessors had his remarks also went beyond what president obama and attorney general eric h holder jr have said since an unarmed black teenager , michael brown , was killed by a white police officer in ferguson , mo , in august mr comey said that his speech , which was well received by law enforcement officials , was motivated by his belief that the country had not had a healthy dialogue since the protests began in ferguson and that he did not want to see those important issues drift away previous fbi directors had limited their public comments about race to civil rights investigations , like murders committed by the ku klux klan and the bureau s wiretapping of the rev dr martin luther king jr but mr comey tried to dissect the issue layer by layer he started by acknowledging that law enforcement had a troubled legacy when it came to race all of us in law enforcement must be honest enough to acknowledge that much of our history is not pretty , he said at many points in american history , law enforcement enforced the status quo , a status quo that was often brutally unfair to disfavored groups mr comey said there was significant research showing that all people have unconscious racial biases law enforcement officers , he said , need to design systems and processes to overcome that very human part of us all although the research may be unsettling , what we do next is what matters most , mr comey said he said nearly all police officers had joined the force because they wanted to help others speaking in personal terms , mr comey described how most americans had initially viewed irish immigrants like his ancestors as drunks , ruffians and criminals law enforcement s biased view of the irish lives on in the nickname we still use for the vehicle that transports groups of prisoners it is , after all , the paddy wagon , ' he said but he said that what the irish had gone through was nothing compared with what blacks had faced that experience should be part of every american s consciousness , and law enforcement s role in that experience , including in recent times , must be remembered , he said it is our cultural inheritance unlike mayor bill de blasio of new york and mr holder , who were roundly faulted by police groups for their critical remarks about law enforcement , mr comey , a former prosecutor whose grandfather was a police chief in yonkers , was praised for his remarks ron hosko , the president of the law enforcement legal defense fund and a former senior fbi official , said that while mr holder s statements about policing and race after the ferguson shooting had placed the blame directly on the police , mr comey s remarks were far more nuanced and thoughtful he looked at all the sociological pieces , mr hosko said the director s comments were far more balanced , because it was n't just heavyhanded on the cops mr comey said the police had received most of the blame in episodes like the ferguson shooting and the death of an unarmed black man in staten island who was placed in a chokehold by an officer , but law enforcement was not the root cause of problems in our hardesthit neighborhoods in many of those areas , blacks grow up in environments lacking role models , adequate education and decent employment , he said mr comey said tensions could be eased if the police got to know those they were charged to protect it s hard to hate up close , he said he also recommended that law enforcement agencies be compelled , by legislation if necessary , to report shootings that involve police officers , and that those reports be recorded in an accessible database when mr brown was shot in ferguson , mr comey said , fbi officials could not say whether such shootings were common or rare because no statistics were available it s ridiculous that i ca n't tell you how many people were shot by the police last week , last month , last year , mr comey said he added , without complete and accurate data , we are left with ideological thunderbolts ronald e teachman , the police chief in south bend , ind , said mr comey did not need to take on the issue but chief teachman said it would be far easier for him to continue the discussion in indiana now that mr comey had done so in such a public manner it helps me move the conversation forward when the fbi director speaks so boldly , he said mr comey concluded by quoting dr king , who said , we must all learn to live together as brothers , or we will all perish together as fools we all have work to do hard work to do , challenging work and it will take time , mr comey said we all need to talk , and we all need to listen , not just about easy things , but about hard things , too relationships are hard relationships require work so let s begin it is time to start seeing one another for who and what we really are
in news reports over the past year , the metropolitan opera has come across as an ailing patient , its costs and revenues spiraling in opposite directions while many observers agree that the company s financial model is unsustainable , at least in the long term , there s far more disagreement about the quality of its performances at the beginning of the 201415 season , which ends on saturday , i resolved to take the met s artistic temperature by attending , as i never had before , all of the operas it presented 26 this year at least once each and often more i tried to catch notable newcomers and cast changes , to move beyond the premieres and big stars to see how things are faring on those ordinary nights that are an opera house s lifeblood so how s the company s health \? let s go through it anatomically the met still is n't a place for deep thoughts its muchdebated staging of john adams s the death of klinghoffer was dully literalminded , replacing the dreamlike ambiguities of the 1991 work with corny cnnstyle realism otto schenk s slack , storybooksimple 1993 production of wagner s die meistersinger von n rnberg had its last revival , and not a minute too soon only the baritone michael volle , who stepped in for two performances as hans sachs , gave the opera grit and intelligence the director mariusz trelinski s , new to the met , of tchaikovsky s iolanta and bartok s bluebeard s castle at least had a point of view otherwise it was up to revivals of verdi s la traviata \( in willy decker s stark staging \) and humperdinck s hansel and gretel \( macabre as directed by richard jones \) to inspire fresh thoughts about classic works and at the end of the season , three rare performances of stravinsky s the rake s progress made a welcome cameo conducting six operas after a long period of illness and injury , james levine , the company s music director , was back in business , but less consistent , keeping alive the notion that his tenure really should n't linger too much longer thankfully , the met is cultivating other talents yannick n zets guin did astonishing work in a richer and deeper than his last take on the opera here , in 2010 the young bel canto specialist michele mariotti kept up the energy in rossini s il barbiere di siviglia and teased out delicate lyricism in his la donna del lago emmanuel villaume gave massenet s manon lithe agility , while james conlon milked shostakovich s lady macbeth of mtsensk for every drop of savage energy and fabio luisi , the met s principal conductor , who i 've long associated with polished but sedate performances , finally hit his stride with a hurtling macbeth , a detailed double bill of cavalleria rusticana and pagliacci and suave leadership of the second cast of the merry widow mr levine was not long ago notoriously prone to cancellations but he missed just one performance \( out of 36 \) this year , and i happened to be there verdi s un ballo in maschera on april 28 the cast , led by sondra radvanovsky and piotr beczala , found out just minutes before curtain that john keenan , a talented veteran staff conductor , would be on the podium , and they responded with performances of verve and nerve , oldfashioned in the best sense but also natural fits with david alden s creepily surreal 2012 production that was n't the only evening when fires raged at the met the revival of graham vick s raucous 1994 staging of lady macbeth of mtsensk was a valuable reminder that vibrant , relevant theater existed at the met long before peter gelb , the company s general manager since 2006 manon starred diana damrau and vittorio grigolo , showing the kind of chemistry difficult to find on an opera stage roberto alagna gave his all in carmen as did nadja michael in bluebeard s castle new blood , that is sonya yoncheva combined subtle , specific acting and artful vocalism in unplanned star turns in la boh me and la traviata making her met debut , ailyn p rez brought focus and purpose to mica la in carmen , a character too often limply passive tamara wilson , joining a run of aida in the title role , made a far more passionate pair with the mezzo violeta urmana than liudmyla monastyrska and olga borodina had earlier in the run , and the young tenor paul appleby was a bright spot as david in die meistersinger and tom rakewell in the rake s progress \( even seeing everything , you ca n't see everything among many regretful omissions , i missed the tenor michael fabiano s muchpraised in la boh me and lucia di lammermoor \) oh , right , those the most glamorous singing of the year came from a cast that could n't have been bettered anywhere in the world verdi s macbeth with anna netrebko , zeljko lucic , joseph calleja and ren pape mr calleja s bronzecolor tenor is distinctive enough that he was the best part of a revival of lucia di lammermoor , even while audibly recovering from the flu verdi s ernani was fatally marred by one of the more illconsidered and roughtoned of pl cido domingo s recent forays into the baritone repertory and two tenors with similar first names had very different impacts marcello giordani sounded tattered in aida while marcelo lvarez was plangent in the double bill dubbed mr lvarez s leading ladies fared worse evamaria westbroek , powerful in lady macbeth , was a sour santuzza in cavalleria rusticana , and patricia racette , a likable actress , sounded squally in pagliacci in a theater the size of the met , the most important nonmusical quality might be visual flair a production can be traditional or contemporary , spare or elaborate , so long as it pops past that immense proscenium and over the gaping orchestra pit memorable sights this season included the mirrored , sloping walls of un ballo in maschera and the spooky forest of iolanta and bluebeard s castle but the other new sets were uniformly flawed a dark , leaden le nozze di figaro on opening night a ship s deck in the death of klinghoffer marooned between realism and stylization staid flats for the merry widow a dimly lit , stagefilling turntable in cavalleria rusticana and , worst of all , almost nothing to evoke the natural world so integral to la donna del lago what sunk the met s new production of lehar s unveiled on new year s eve was the script , an englishlanguage version of the classic operetta by jeremy sams , who also recently had key roles translating johann strauss ii s die fledermaus and developing the baroque pastiche the enchanted island long scenes of spoken dialogue fall flat in the vast met , especially when the jokes are as lame as these a small handful of performances were dead on arrival , and they were disproportionately in mozart grim and awkwardly staged , the michael grandage production of don giovanni is , after a few revivals , demonstrably unsalvageable , and the met keeps casting it weakly the final matinee of die zauberfl te was similarly uninspired , dotted with young singers who seemed out of their league along with the new bland figaro , this track record does n't fill me with hope for next season s revival of die entf hrung aus dem serail or for a future cos fan tutte , a challenging opera in desperate need of a new met production after seeing dozens of performances over the past seven months , it s clear that mr gelb has put the met on xanax while the highest highs , the most memorable nights , might be rarer now than they were in the socalled golden age of 40 or 50 years ago , you 're also less likely than you were then to stumble across a truly unacceptable , even laughable performance unlike , say , the vienna state opera , the only major company to exceed the met in sheer volume and where certain operas still make it onstage in decidedly amateurish condition , the met has achieved a steady , dependable level of professionalism , anchored by the orchestra and chorus mixed next season s lineup looks hopeful , with wellcast new productions of verdi s otello , berg s lulu and strauss s elektra , and runs of all three of donizetti s tudor trilogy operas among the offerings and the past months have brought exciting evenings , some predictable and some unexpected macbeth , lady macbeth of mtsensk , manon , ms yoncheva s performances , ballo , the dazzling way mr n zets guin lightened the orchestral textures in the elisabettacarlo duet in don carlo to evoke past happiness , the rake s progress but it says a lot that mr levine was on the podium for just one of these performances and that none of the six new productions were among them something is n't right at the met if the marquee offerings of its leadership are n't among the season s highlights mr gelb , who has made the met stronger and livelier still needs help developing new stagings and new works he is not an artistic director or a director of productions , and the met sorely needs someone in that role when the patient is ailing , sometimes a team shakeup is just what the doctor ordered
anyone who wrote off the , the , the or the early on , when they slid to the bottom of the standings , better have used pencil none of those teams have championshiplevel talent , but they have revived their fortunes and are making some noise yes , all are 45 and have the kinds of holes that virtually eliminate them from contention for the lombardi trophy but they are revitalized and figure to be dangerous opponents down the stretch , with the texans and the redskins still in the mix for titles in weak divisions our guys have to understand ok , how did we get to this point \? texans coach bill o'brien said well , we 're doing these things this way we 've got to continue to do it that way it s all about hard work and putting the time in chiefs coach andy reid said , i always felt like the sky s the limit for this team , as long as we 're in the right mindset and ready to go the mindset is pretty positive right now , even though houston started 14 , kansas city 15 , chicago 25 and washington 24 the texans ended the bengals' unbeaten streak monday night in cincinnati the chiefs won handily at denver , driving peyton manning to the bench the bears are 30 against the afc west and bullied the st louis rams' hardcharging defense last weekend the redskins have beaten the philadelphia eagles , the early nfc east favorite , and hammered the new orleans saints last sunday so what has changed , and where are these teams headed \? o'brien guided the texans to a 97 record last season after their leagueworst 214 in 2013 that came with a revolving cast of quarterbacks deandre hopkins has emerged as one of the nfl s best receivers far more significant has been the rebirth of the defense j j watt remains the game s best defensive lineman , and probably its best defensive player tied for the lead in the afc south , the texans finish with three division games they probably need to sweep after an opening victory , the chiefs handed a game to the broncos and went into a funk , losing four straight but there always has been faith in the defense charcandrick west has been a suitable replacement for the injured running back jamaal charles and tight end travis kelce has been terrific the afc wildcard race is muddled , and kansas city s remaining schedule is weak this turnaround might be the most stunning the bears looked inept in their first three outings , and their first three victories came by a total of six points in fairness , though , quarterback jay cutler has ranged from steady to sensational in the last month , with his work in a comeback win at san diego perhaps the best of his muchmaligned career a 500 record would be significant progress in chicago the other wildcard contenders are better than the bears still , progress is being made a victory sunday against undefeated carolina would be monumental it would lift the redskins into a tie for first place in the nfc east , and they have four divisional games remaining that washington is even in that conversation is remarkable given how unimpressive this team has been in most areas the running game should be far better than it has been , and the run defense is weak but quarterback kirk cousins can make a difference when he is on , and his receivers are strong so is the coaching a victory sunday would say a lot about washington
tokyo the olympic stadium designed by the pritzkerwinning architect zaha hadid , to be built here for the 2020 summer games , looks to some like a pleasingly sleek , contoured spaceship but many others deplore it , with one prominent japanese architect saying it reminded him of a turtle another likened the 137 billion building , already projected to be the most expensive olympic stadium in recent history , to another kind of animal why do we need this white elephant \? said fumihiko maki , also a pritzker winner tokyo is not a zoo for nearly a year , the criticism of the hadid design has been fullthroated about 500 people took to the streets last summer to protest it as oversized and overpriced while ms hadid suggests her critics are only embarrassing themselves and that they resent the hiring of a nonjapanese architect they do n't want a foreigner to build in tokyo for a national stadium , said ms hadid , an iraqibritish architect , in an interview with dezeen , a design magazine beyond the merits of her design , the debate illustrates how olympic stadiums engender more passion than almost any other buildings , and how the massive , expensive public projects become potent symbols of architectural prowess and economic pride structures in which countries invest nothing less than their national identities there is always some controversy around large iconic buildings , said mike holleman of heery international , the architectural firm that designed the stadium for the 1996 summer olympics in atlanta they are opportunities for countries to say to the world we 've arrived , here s an iconic venue we can do that' that is the goal , to show the world that you can step up indeed , the japan sport council , which governs the tokyo stadium , said in an emailed statement we aim to build japan s national stadium to boast to the world sometimes , a country appears to get it right , as china seemed to do in beijing with its national stadium for the 2008 olympics nicknamed the bird s nest because of herzog de meuron s lattice exterior it received international acclaim for what the new york times called its  the tokyo stadium faces another challenge that has dogged its cousins it must avoid becoming an economic burden by carving out a life as an arena long after the closing ceremonies montreal s stadium , for example , designed for the 1976 olympics by the french architect roger taillibert , left the city with 15 billion in debt that took 30 years to repay , earning the arena a nickname change from the big o to the big owe scheduled events there are sporadic , as they are for the stadium used for the 2004 summer olympic games in athens , which has been widely criticized for not having a postolympics plan one success story is the los angeles memorial coliseum , which has twice served as an olympics arena in 1932 and 1984 and continues to be used for college football and other events olympics officials are emphasizing permanent use in evaluating possible sites for the 2024 summer olympics the problem with olympic stadiums is it s somehow the most terrible commitment , said jacques herzog , one of the bird s nest architects you have to think about what will happen after the games are over the majority are there for nothing , or are ruins , or do n't really have a meaning anymore in tokyo , the sport council has unveiled an elaborate postolympics plan for the new 80 , 000seat stadium that includes sports , cultural and civic events a city that builds a stadium solely for the olympics , without solid plans in place for its longterm use , will greatly diminish the stadium s future viability , ms hadid said in emailed responses to questions but none of that planning has stemmed criticism of the design by ms hadid , who won an international competition to design the arena some critics are concerned that the new stadium , which is much larger than an existing 54 , 000seat stadium built for the 1964 summer olympics , will encroach on the nearby historic meiji shrine , built in central tokyo in the early 20th century to commemorate emperor meiji the arena would occupy part of the shrine s outer gardens , which preservationists say would leave no breathing space and raises traffic and safety concerns officials here have reacted to the public outcry by reducing the proposed stadium s size and budget ms hadid s earlier version came in at about 25 billion , more than twice the 11 billion originally allocated for the stadium the sport council at first called for a retractable roof to soundproof future cultural events like concerts the steep cost of building and maintaining such an apparatus , critics said , would take away valuable materials and financial resources still needed for reconstruction after the 2011 earthquake and tsunami after sustained objections from critics , including mr maki and the 2013 pritzker winner toyo ito , the japanese government reduced the stadium s budget to 137 billion and its site to 52 acres , down from 71 the revised design still includes a retractable roof all projects around the world go through this process of design evolution , said ms hadid , who also designed the aquatics center for the 2012 summer olympics in london working with our japanese partners to refine the design was always an expected part of the process ms hadid s firm worked with four design firms three of them japanese to revise the stadium , the sport council said even after the government scaled back the project , however , the chorus of criticism intensified , sometimes emphasizing a different angle in an open letter to the sport council , a prominent japanese architect , arata isozaki , wrote that he was shocked to see that the dynamism present in the original had gone in the new designs what remains is a dull , slow form , mr isozaki wrote , like a turtle waiting for japan to sink so that it can swim away i ca n't find zaha s hand anymore , he added in an interview i can only see the pressures of the council critics in japan are divided over how to resolve the situation mr isozaki , for example , has called for ms hadid to come up with a new design without the help of japanese firms others have urged the sport council to scrap ms hadid s plan altogether instead , they argue , the government should renovate the existing national stadium , despite plans for it to be demolished this month in any case , both the sport council and ms hadid say retrofitting the existing stadium is not viable because the building does not meet olympic stadium requirements or current seismic codes reinforcing the existing structure , they said , would cost far more than critics estimate , adding that even after renovation , the spectator conditions would not be ideal though ms hadid s critics have been vocal , previous generations of olympic stadiums have provoked similarly strong reactions stadiums always seem to be in this odd category of potential national symbol for a very short period of time and then potential white elephants , said thomas hanrahan , dean of the school of architecture at the pratt institute that has nothing to do with the architectural design that s the nature of the discussion in tokyo it has to do with planning and the longterm vision
brussels just a month ago , after being propelled to power by a wave of anger at s economic miseries , declared his leftwing syriza party s election victory the start of a europewide revolt against austerity europe is going to change , he said before setting off on a tour of european capitals to rally support for a more relaxed new direction the antiausterity revolution proclaimed by syriza and its fans elsewhere , however , has now fizzled , its passions doused by the political reality that leaders in the rest of europe do not want to join or , more important , finance the greekled revolt greece s hopedfor new dawn for europe ended on a raindrenched friday evening in the justus lipsius building , a huge , sovietstyle brussels office block where finance ministers from the 19 countries that use the euro known as the eurogroup had gathered for their third emergency meeting in two weeks a deal negotiated there lifted the threat of bankruptcy hanging over greece and with it the immediate risk that it might have to leave the eurozone and the 28member european union , an exit that would have delivered a grave blow to europe s sixdecade drive for integration but an agreement to extend greece s bailout for four months also committed it to honor fiscal targets and other conditions it had vowed to scrap and left intact the supervising role of the socalled troika a trio of creditor bodies that syriza wanted banished , viewing it as the hated symbol of their country s subordination to socalled neoliberal economic dogma moreover , the finance ministers made clear that greece will not get any more cash until it satisfies them it can keep a lid on spending , setting the stage for more tense negotiations in coming days and weeks syriza still claimed victory , but few outside the party and some within it saw anything other than an abrupt halt to its iconoclastic vision of a new deal in which voters , not markets and brussels technocrats , decide how money flows and on what terms asked at a news conference on friday whether europe had not trashed greece s democratic will , jeroen dijsselbloem , the dutch finance minister and head of the eurogroup , pointed to a basic truth in an economic bloc where voters in one country cannot tell voters elsewhere how to spend their money it cannot be one country that says can i have support but i will formulate my own conditions \? ' he said instead of scrapping the socalled memorandum a package of austerity and other measures that syriza had declared dead greece , according to a statement agreed to late friday by the greek and other ministers , pledged to refrain from any rollback of measures agreed to by previous governments , or unilateral changes to the policies and structural reforms that would negatively impact fiscal targets , economic recovery or financial stability , as assessed by the institutions , the new euphemism for the troika communist tendency , a small farleft group inside syriza , denounced the commitment as a betrayal of the working class and submission to the blackmail of the troika finance minister wolfgang sch uble of germany , who led opposition to syriza s demands for a thorough rethink of greece s bailout terms , took a swipe in comments to reporters late friday at what he suggested had been the new greek government s dreamy illusions being in government is a date with reality , and reality is often not as nice as a dream , said mr sch uble , who has been pilloried in the greek media as an unfeeling monster bent on deepening greece s economic suffering , which includes a catastrophic 25 percent contraction of the economy since 2010 , along with unemployment of 26 percent over all and above 50 percent for youths but friday s settlement did not really mark the end of a fiveyear greek drama that is still threatening europe s commitment to an ever closer union the next hurdle is a monday deadline for greece to submit a list of all the policy measures it plans to take to satisfy creditors' demands and even if greece s plan passes muster on monday , the whole issue of how to help athens and on what terms will resurface when the extended bailout , worth 240 billion euros , or 273 billion , expires in june and , as many expect , greece needs a further infusion of cash to stave off default negotiations are just beginning , mr tsipras , greece s new prime minister , said in a television address on saturday that cast the previous evening s accord as a victory for his government we won the battle but not the war , he said the real difficulties lie ahead but his political opponents and outside observers derided syriza s cries of victory i think it is almost a total capitulation , said raoul ruparel , the head of economic research at open europe , a research group in london tsipras gambled on austerity fatigue in europe and thought that by flying the flag for change lots of other countries would follow his lead none did even countries like portugal , which also suffered through grinding austerity after it signed up for a bailout with tight conditions , stood firm alongside germany , finland and other northern european countries having slashed budgets and taken other unpopular steps , governments across europe feared that siding with syriza would only empower likeminded insurgent political groups in their own countries let s not kid ourselves , a post on a website affiliated with syriza said on saturday this proposal equals , if not a uturn towards the memorandum , then the burial of any meaningful debt reduction and the freezing of even the most restrained measures in favor of the people that alexis tsipras had personally vowed to implement speaking in brussels , yanis varoufakis , the greek finance minister , dismissed talk of defeat , pointing to a vague promise of flexibility included in the statement issued by the eurogroup as a sign that athens could still rewrite the terms he also returned to a pugnacious tone that had infuriated berlin and many other european capitals , warning that friday s deal would be dead and buried if creditors did not accept greece s proposals on monday guntram wolff , director of bruegel , a research group in brussels , said syriza had severely miscalculated from the start by taking a confrontational approach in a buttondown european union system that embraces quiet consensusbuilding and shuns emotional polemics but its biggest mistake , mr wolff said , was to think that all of southern europe would align behind greece against what athens has presented as german intransigence in defense of austerity for ideological reasons , or simply out of spite syriza s belief that spain , portugal and italy would rally to its antiausterity crusade was fed in part by the rapturous reception mr tsipras and his lieutenants received from likeminded antiestablishment parties ahead of greece s election in january a wind of change is blowing in europe , pablo iglesias , leader of spain s upstart podemos party , told a syriza preelection rally in athens the name of that change in greece is syriza , and the name of the change in spain will be podemos but the surging fortunes of populist parties , left and right , across europe only made sitting leaders more wary of syriza and its policies , even those tired of brusselsmandated budget cuts the antiausterity cause also lost some of its momentum as the european union began to let up on some of its previously harsh demands for cuts and the european central bank announced that , starting in march , it would buy up 60 billion euros worth of government bonds in an effort to spur growth soon after taking power in athens late last month , mr tsipras and mr varoufakis launched a tour of european capitals , impressing fashion mavens with their cool youthful attire , particularly their lack of ties , but also ruffling feathers with their sometimes impetuous comments as syriza hit the road , chancellor angela merkel of germany and mr sch uble quietly pressed their own case for financial discipline , looser labor laws and other change , inviting european leaders to berlin even as ms merkel took the lead in brokering an abortive truce to the conflict in eastern ukraine in between trips to brussels last monday and again on friday for emergency finance ministers' meetings , mr sch uble , a stern 72yearold who has used a wheelchair since a failed assassination attempt in 1990 , attended a presentation given in berlin by the finance minister of portugal , one of the southern european nations greece viewed as natural allies like greece , portugal endured years of austerity after appealing for a financial lifeline but the portuguese minister , maria lu s albuquerque , spoke in berlin of very different lessons from austerity she proudly detailed how portugal had endured and emerged from a bailout aimed at mending her nation s tattered finances it was all about regaining credibility and sticking to rules , she said the next day , just a few hours before his finance minister flew to brussels , mr tsipras continued his own campaign to show that greece was not beholden to germany or other creditors and had friends elsewhere he boarded a visiting chinese warship in the greek port of piraeus and spoke of the special importance of investment from china
paris if sebastian coe thinks beating steve ovett to the finish line or running a successful london olympics was tough , he is now about to embark on something that looks a great deal more daunting saving track and field from itself and from eroding global relevance is the kind of challenge that only a supremely confident , thoroughly committed or genuinely deluded individual would embrace but coe , long considered the golden boy of british sport , is frontandcenter now after being elected president of the iaaf , track and field s world governing body , on wednesday in beijing for me this is the pinnacle , said coe , who has already scaled quite a few peaks in his 58 years it s my sport it s my passion it s the thing i always wanted to do coe , a twotime olympic gold medalist in the 1500 meters , defeated another trackandfield icon , former ukrainian pole vaulter sergey bubka , 115 votes to 92 , with each of the iaaf s member federations allowed one vote coe will officially take over for outgoing president lamine diack on aug 31 , the day after the world championships in beijing those championships begin on saturday in the bird s nest stadium with the sport mired in its latest and maybe even greatest crisis of confidence amid allegations and investigations of continued and widespread doping the opening weekend of the meet has a fine chance of underscoring the issue in the men s 100 meters , usain bolt , by far the sport s biggest star , could quite possibly lose to justin gatlin , the american sprinter who has twice been banned for doping violations and has recorded the world s fastest times in the event this season gatlin has served his suspensions and has the right to compete in beijing , which coe duly noted at his postvictory news conference on wednesday , adding that gatlin should be accorded all respect wherever he finishes but gatlin , because of his past , remains one of the many \( many \) athletes who have contributed to the sport s decline in credibility and appeal through the decades how to care as a spectator when you cannot trust in what you see \? coe understands all this , of course once the world s premier middledistance runner , he was still an active athlete in 1988 when canadian sprinter ben johnson tested positive after winning the 100 meters at the olympics in seoul still the biggest scandal in track and field history he has been on the iaaf council since 2003 and a vice president since 2007 the year that american sprinter and long jumper marion jones publicly admitted to having taken steroids and lying to federal agents under oath during their investigation into the bay area laboratory cooperative \( balco \) jones returned her five medals from the 2000 olympics and later served a short prison sentence now comes this latest wave of revelations and allegations there are ongoing investigations into systematic doping by russian athletes and continued concern about the scope of doping in traditional track power kenya the german broadcaster ard and the british newspaper the sunday times have released previously confidential results from an iaaf database and concluded that blood doping is widespread in endurance events a conclusion the iaaf has disputed meanwhile , the iaaf confirmed that 28 athletes were found to have committed doping violations after their samples from the 2005 and 2007 world championships were retested with current technology the iaaf said none of those athletes would take part in beijing it all makes for quite a minefield for newly elected president coe it is not as if he did not have other options a former conservative member of parliament in britain , he could have after the big success of the 2012 london olympics leaped back into british politics he could have continued to pursue his wideranging and occasionally intertwined business interests some of which \( adviser to nike \) he will now have to unravel to avoid conflicts as president or he could have , with his 60th birthday approaching , simply rested on his laurels instead he traveled about 700 , 000 kilometers and shook thousands of hands in the successful campaign to secure one of the most exposed posts in global sports this felt like a crossroads for me , said ed warner , chairman of uk athletics , in comments to bbc radio on wednesday not that sergei bubka would n't have been a good president , but the challenges facing athletics are such that we need a great president right now and i do believe seb has the range of skills and the character required to really pull us forward and make sure we remain relevant to the public across the world for decades to come that will be quite the challenge , and it was encouraging on wednesday to find out that coe , unlike diack and some of his predecessors , will not remain in power for decades the iaaf congress approved a rule change that limits presidents to 12 years , or three fouryear terms more changes should be forthcoming , perhaps quickly coe has said that he plans to create a doping agency that is independent of the iaaf to increase efficiency and , above all , credibility there is a zero tolerance to the abuse of doping in my sport , he said wednesday and i will maintain that to the very highest levels of diligence he has sketched out plans to increase street meets in major cities and to deploy social media in an innovative fashion , as his team did for the london olympics he intends to make the sport s bordercrossing diamond league calendar more legible and find a way to make the stars compete against each other much more frequently perhaps through new team competitions in which athletes would represent a city instead of their country he wants to push his sport in india \( and not just because his mother was halfindian \) he wants to revitalize the sport in the united states \( the recent iaaf decision to award the 2021 world championships to eugene , ore is encouraging \) coe also after all his world travels and reconnaissance missions in recent months wants to devolve power from iaaf headquarters to regions and individual federations , many of whom lack the latitude and means at the moment to create meaningful change one of the things that was very impressive about seb s vision to elevate the sport was how progressive it was , said max siegel , the chief executive officer of usa track and field , in a recent interview he wants to think differently than anyone has done traditionally , and he does think differently deep thinking , evident talent , hard toil and a gift for communication and delegation have allowed him to overcome obstacle after obstacle in his career but the obstacle in front of him now looks much more like the himalayas than a hurdle off with the spikes on with the crampons
no dance form is an island last week brought me three genres of western dance \( ballroom , ballet , modern \) and the weekend brought three examples of indian dance it reminded me that just as you can never fully know any one genre , each casts light on others watching indian dance , this westerner can only miss nuances obvious to many indians , while making other connections in the first indian program and , mother and daughter , dancing in the bharata natyam genre of southeastern india on saturday night at the skirball center for the performing arts we were plunged straightaway into a dance realm with its own character and laws the two women are physically alike and dance similarly , so their duets had terrific uniformity of style \( they were accompanied by four musicians s vasudevan and k venkateshwaran alternated as vocalist \) one of the duets was about duality itself mother and daughter were sometimes back to back , like two sides of a coin a second , the evening s most intimate piece , was about a mother s feelings on finding that her daughter is now an adult and a third was about body and spirit in solos , rama \( the mother \) has the greater wealth of resources and subtle expressive tones her range , intelligence and mastery have made a deeper impression on me each time i 've seen her she s capable of great dance intensity in passages of nritta \( pure form \) , she relished the multidirectional geometries of movement in one , traveling diagonally , her feet , bitingly , carried her in one direction while an arm and her eyes lustrously opened up a separate arc in a sequence of abhinaya \( expressive mime \) , demonstrating a woman s longing for lord shiva , she showed how gestures can include waiting , listening and responsiveness as well as declaration dakshina \( her daughter , whom i saw perform for the first time on saturday \) is even more marvelously satisfying in the curved and straight shapes of bharata natyam her chief solo showed shiva and his consort parvati conjoined as ardhanariswara male and female , destruction and creation as she stands on wideparted legs and sways her torso violently from side to side , we ca n't miss an image of destructive power sunday evening s performance , also at the skirball center at new york university \( both programs were presented by the world music institute \) , was of the dissimilar genre of kathak , which specializes in rapidly rhythmic footwork \( suddenly ending bang ! on the beat \) and long series of single turns on the spot parul shah and prashant shah \( no relation \) joined forces in an opening duet , to recorded music then each danced to live accompaniment by different fivemusician teams , parul with the four other women of her company in parul shah s , all that is in between , you could sense a lively experimental mind , here moving away from there joining forces with the music the start and end , featuring percussive hand gestures striking the chest with no musical accompaniment , stays in memory in between , a complex female dance polyphony develops this is a good company , stylish and vivid you can feel how its innovations \( no ankle bells \) are part of an engagement with the changing nature of indian society prashant shah s solo , parampara ek pravaah , was an enthralling display of kathak virtuosity his interplay with his musicians truly playful involved rhythmic patterns of astonishing intricacy what amazed me was the grace of mr shah s arms and upper body \( only his facial expressions , especially the use of eyes and smiles , are sometimes forced \) despite his topspeed footwork and its stoponadime conclusions , his arms moved in waves , rivulets , soft flourishes , always demonstrating calm and ease within brilliance his rhythms \( and those of his tabla percussionist , ramesh bapodara \) were a superbly exciting demonstration of kathak complexity one cluster of strong and weak beats is topped by the next at two or three times the speed , and then by a third with suddendeath pauses within the rush only one of the weekend s three performances disappointed this was veiled moon , presented on sunday afternoon by thresh dance company at the metropolitan museum after william dalrymple s engaging lecture about aspects of hyderabad s history the dance seemed to evoke the life and works of the exceptional 18thcentury muslim courtesan mah laqa bai chanda and costuming suggested that period and a general atmosphere of feminine languor , if not creativity but everything was vague , slow with none of the flow of meanings or forms that makes so much of indian dance so rewarding

the latest new york timescbs news poll makes divisions clear , from the choice of a presidential nominee to whether party members are willing to see their leaders compromise on legislation for the first time since the times and cbs news began testing candidate preferences in july , the retired neurosurgeon has displaced as the leader of the large republican field , although the difference is well within the poll s margin of sampling error the churn in the field suggests more volatility as the contest draws closer to the primaries early next year mr carson and mr trump draw support from different segments of the republican electorate , with mr carson winning the allegiance of evangelicals and selfdescribed conservatives mr trump does better among republican primary voters who do not have a college education and with those who are not evangelical the two wings of the party also differ on issues ranging from taxes and immigration to gun control and republican voters appear remarkably aware of their own challenges threequarters of those surveyed called their own party divided and seven in 10 acknowledged that republicans were at least partly to blame for dysfunction and gridlock in washington the intraparty differences could be difficult to bridge a majority of republican voters said their leaders should be willing to offer concessions to get things done in washington , but about four in 10 said that republican officials should stick to their principles even if it meant more legislative paralysis and the party s appetite for compromise is only waning while 56 percent of republican voters surveyed said congressional republicans should compromise , that is a decline of 12 percentage points from when republicans were asked the same question in july 2013 , shortly before the last shutdown of the federal government the growing anger toward what they see as capitulation was illustrated again on tuesday when conservatives reacted with fury over what they said what was the party leaders' secret negotiations and deal with president obama to increase spending and raise the  republican voters are plainly disappointed in the house and senate majorities they elected twothirds of republican voters disapprove of the way republicans in congress are handling their jobs and frustrated that even with majorities in both chambers , republican leaders cannot seem to break the gridlock i thought when there was a republican majority in the house and the senate , everything was going to be fine , but that was n't case , dan mclane , 69 , a retired toolanddie maker in canfield , ohio , said in an interview after the poll results were clear when the came in , i thought it was the greatest thing since sliced bread , so to speak , but that was n't the case there were n't enough of them to get things where they should be and it just created dissension the thing i like about them is they are like bulldogs and they just hold to their principles , but you can only take them to a certain point the party is unambiguously united , however , in one respect they share a deep dissatisfaction with washington only 10 percent of those surveyed said they were enthusiastic or satisfied with what is happening in the capital , while 37 percent described themselves as angry and 52 percent as dissatisfied the party s discontent with elected leaders is on vivid display in its presidential nominating contest the top two contenders are political outsiders using inflammatory language to criticize washington , attributes that appear to have lifted them mr carson and mr trump are each drawing support of more than 20 percent of the party s voters , while candidates with considerable political experience such as , gov john r kasich of ohio and gov chris christie of new jersey languish in single digits the republican race , however , remains unsettled , and the party s third wednesday could further scramble the field early national polls have proven unreliable predictors in the last two republican presidential races , which have been shaped by the winners of the states that kick off the nominating process seven in 10 primary voters who expressed support for a candidate said it was too early to say for sure which candidate they would support just 28 percent indicated their mind was made up the number of republicans indicating it is too early to decide is an increase from the results when the question was asked in september , suggesting that the race may only become more turbulent in a sign of their uncertainty about who to support , none of the six hopefuls tested found enthusiastic support from a majority of their party s primary voters mr carson came the closest 48 percent of republicans said they would enthusiastically support him but 35 percent indicated they would back him with reservations or only because he was the nominee mr bush , though , is finding the most resistance in trying to appeal to his party only 18 percent of republicans said they would enthusiastically support bush , a son and brother of republican presidents , the lowest of any candidate , and about half of primary voters said they would either support him because he was the nominee or not vote for him at all while mr carson holds a tenuous lead in this poll , support for mr trump appears firmer than it is for mr carson a majority of trump supporters , 55 percent , say their mind is made up but 80 percent of carson supporters say it is too early to say for sure such numbers indicate that mr trump may have a floor of support that he can count on if he is willing to stay in the race while he is no longer leading in every poll , which , until now , had been his calling card on policy , republicans are splintered among their ideological blocs fiftyeight percent say the party should reduce the deficit through a combination of tax increases and spending cuts , while 40 percent say it should be done only through spending cuts nearly half of republican voters prefer gun control laws be kept as they are while 39 percent say gun regulations should be made more strict more than four in 10 republicans think illegal immigrants should be allowed to stay in america and apply for citizenship while 38 percent say the undocumented should be required to leave the country and while 38 percent of republicans say samesex couples should be allowed to marry , 55 percent of the party s voters say such unions should be illegal for representative , who is likely to succeed representative john a boehner as speaker of the house , there is some good news while nearly half of republicans do not have an opinion of mr ryan , the vice presidential nominee in 2012 , he is viewed more positively than negatively by those who do know him , including among the conservatives most critical of mr boehner and washington i think when new blood comes in , people are sometimes more apt to go with them , george labrecque , 73 , a retired insurance salesman in lakeland , fla , said in a followup interview and i also think is a bit more conservative than john boehner he s more apt to fight for certain things boehner just did n't seem to want to fight anything
martin brodeur is a new york icon who belongs in the same company as jeter and seaver , clyde and broadway joe , l t and jackie robinson and the babe it does n't matter that he played the fourth team

that he just might stay on in the front office past this season that would be a gaffe the devils would have to answer for over the years brodeur , glittering in the mental new york landscape , like the , raising her torch in her right hand the way brodeur raised his left glove while catching a screamer in front of the net records turn athletes into icons , more than any other nhl goalie now he is emphatically part of the blues in his bilingual retirement news conference in st louis on thursday , he raved about his experience in his new town without mentioning lou lamoriello , who runs every aspect of the devils , until he was asked about his future for anybody that thinks me and lou are not on the same page , everybody is wrong , brodeur said but the best goalie in the history of the new york region is working in the front office in another city , at least through this season icons do sometimes move away a son of montreal , speaking articulate english with a charming qu b cois accent , mahrtan brohdyoor played outside the city limits and finished up in missouri , but somewhere along the way , new york adopted him the way we even take in sons of boston as mayors if they can make it here brodeur made it in new york , playing for a franchise by none other than wayne gretzky in 1984 gretzky was making an uncharacteristic slight of a relocated franchise , but that was before brodeur won three cups \( and reached two other finals \) twelve years later , gretzky opted for a hitch in madison square garden as part of his dossier as world superstar according to the new york scale of values , one stanley cup in the world s most expensive arena is worth 10 or 12 cups off the island of manhattan mark messier made himself into a new york legend by willing the rangers to one count it , one stanley cup , in 1994 brodeur was a rookie that season , losing to the rangers in the eastern conference finals he would eventually play 1 , 259 games for the devils \( before his sevengame coda with st louis \) , 21 seasons , putting him in the same amorphous , arbitrary category of new york icons along with the likes of derek jeter and mariano rivera walt frazier and his mates when the knicks were delightful , not execrable lawrence taylor , whose aggressive linebacking helped win two super bowls for the giants and joe namath , who won the only super bowl the jets have ever won then there are the islanders , who play on the flatlands of nassau county , farther from midtown than brodeur did the islanders became one of the great north american teams , winning four stanley cups from 1980 through 1983 stars like mike bossy and denis potvin and coach al arbour celebrated the cups on hempstead turnpike , not along the canyon of heroes , and their lasting impression in the garden may be next season the islanders will shuffle into brooklyn , but for the moment they are raising echoes of an ancient civilization the meandering nets , now in brooklyn , managed to lose julius erving from long island and got lost in the swamplands of new jersey in an arena brodeur played most of his career there , and lit up the dump brodeur s long run puts him in the pantheon of new york sports icons that is littered with yankees some stars played their whole careers in new york , but the rules were different back in the day , because players were bound by contract until their teams had no use for them the boys of summer were heroes in brooklyn for a full postwar decade partly because the players could not entertain higher offers the most historic figure was robinson , but dodgers management had no conscience about trying to trade him to the hated giants after the 1956 season to be fair , one final fling elsewhere cannot be held against superstars of any time or place if it s not the money , it s the love of the game , or both christy mathewson departed the giants to manage the reds in 1916 and let himself pitch one complete game \( nine innings , eight runs , one victory

relative , not only of the city but also of joan whitney payson , the owner of the mets , whose family had once owned a small piece of the giants in her jolly , entitled way , she meant no harm , even if her nostalgia led to the unfortunate game in the 1973 world series when mays stumbled in the outfield and on the basepaths , his great reflexes clearly shot he retired after that series , but everybody understood the sentimentality behind his homecoming the elegant frazier even , for goodness' sakes , after the knicks had no use for him in 2013 , frazier of the radio station wnyc about his time in cleveland i used to get dressed up and go out and wear my mink guys 'd go , clyde , where are you going \?

i can remember the last time television made me laugh , and the last time it made me cry but i ca n't remember the last time a scripted tv show scared me , and that worries me , because i like a good scare so do i have hopes for the fall season , which brings the highprofile newcomers and ash vs evil dead along with returning fright fare like american horror story \? no , i do not part of this is just me i 've watched lots of horror movies and tv shows but part of it is not just me i'm getting the impression that tv creators are n't trying very hard to scare anymore as much as they 're trying to make us laugh under the guise of scaring us exhibit a scream queens , which begins sept 22 on fox the series , about a sorority whose members have a tendency to be murdered , has a starry cast with some solid horror credentials , including jamie lee curtis of the franchise but it does n't seem particularly interested in atmosphere if the pilot is any indication , it s essentially a comedy , one built on broad caricatures ms curtis plays a hardnosed antigreek dean , and emma roberts is a spoiledbrat sorority leader scream queens does indeed scream it screams , scary is too hard what s interesting is that the series is from ryan murphy productions , the same outfit that brought us fx s american horror story , a show that actually was scary for a while that anthology series returns oct 7 for a fifth season with lady gaga as a main cast member , it sounds as if it 'll be great fun that , of course , is a problem fun and genuinely scary are n't really descriptions that should belong together the first season of american horror story was unsettling because it was all so new and expectationfree the luridness , the vivid stage pictures , the unhinged performances by name stars , the rubber man now , though , the series is more like a sideshow \( and not just because last season involved an actual sideshow \) you go to gawk more than to be frightened american horror story has become more interested in pushing television s boundaries \( see the many indignities inflicted on the human body in season 3 s coven \) than in giving you nightmares though to be fair , i 'd just as soon not watch any of right before bedtime another new fall show , the starz series ash vs evil dead , which arrives on halloween , also appears to be doubling down on fun bruce campbell , older and considerably less fit , reprises the role he first played in the 1981 film the evil dead , and is a collection of moments meant to evoke the original trilogy a head that gets turned 180 degrees a possessed doll a possessed granny a chain saw it looks hilarious , but it s also emblematic of a problem with the genre a tendency to replay the scares of the past see scream , a summer mtv series , inspired by the movie franchise but nowhere near as freshfeeling as the best of those films to try to illuminate my malaise , i turned to stephen king or , more specifically , to his 1981 nonfiction book about horror fiction and film in it he postulates three types of scariness , and none of them are doing very well these days on television the first type is revulsion , like the gutchurning scare of a severed head with even ordinary cop shows reveling in closeups of wounds and trauma care , drawing an eeyew response with stage blood today is close to impossible in 1929 , when moving images were still somewhat new , luis bu uel could slice an eyeball in and haunt the dreams of moviegoers for years today any operatingroom scene in a medical drama has open body cavities with pulsating organs the revulsion effect is momentary if it occurs at all mr king s second category is horror , or coming face to face with some sort of monster again , television is well covered the creatures on fx s the strain look great , but so do the ones on or any other show with a decent budget admire the technical proficiency , but do n't expect to be frightened that s especially true if you watch this stuff on a cellphone or tablet it s hard to take a monster seriously when you could neutralize it with a fly swatter for me , the best chance to be scared comes via mr king s third category terror , instilling a feeling of dread or foreboding by relying more on the threat of harm than on blood or beasts but that s a difficult effect to sustain in a weekly series , which is my problem with the strain as well as amc s wildly popular zombie show , whose sixth season begins oct 11 those shows were initially great at invoking dread the slow realization that the world is ending is always good for some goose bumps but excess soon took over a walking dead companion series that began in august , went back before the apocalypse and rediscovered the power of anticipation the show that has best worked that side of scary recently has been a catandmouse psychological thriller involving an fbi agent and a serial killer honorable mention fox s the following , for which the same plot summary applies both shows were canceled this year after three seasons hannibal , a prequel series to the silence of the lambs , spent a lot of time on moody atmospherics , a must for any show hoping to instill a sense of apprehension but also vital to scary shows set in the real world is finding a character or entity or conceit that the viewer might legitimately connect to real life perhaps the dreamlike hannibal and the following did n't last because the notion of the uncatchable serial killer not only has been too heavily exploited but is also out of sync with the headlines yes , there are still serial killers , but i am more alarmed at the thought of terrorists in cockpits and rifles in movie theaters so what scares us now , really scares us , in a way that lingers long after the tv has been shut off \? anything that shakes our faith in a central part of our lives all those reality shows that have searched for but never quite found ghosts or bigfoot are the last gasps of the age of superstition , when humans suspected something spooky was lurking in the woods or the attic now that the world s all rational and scientific , if you really want to scare us , attack us where we live , in our cellphones and our internet and our addiction to the conveniences of modern life which is to say that i , at least , have found a greater feeling of unease and dread outside the horror genre than in it the hacker geeks of cbs s scorpion and creep me out every time they do something invasive with technology that i did n't realize could be done a comedy like silicon valley creeps me out with its notimprobable suggestions that buffoons may be pulling strings that are ultimately attached to me i'm not sure these shows outright scare me , but they leave a trace of anxiety that i carry into the real world with me all those zombies and monsters \? they stay trapped inside my television

carol burnett has been many things in her 60year career a bestselling memoirist \( one more time \) , a broadway playwright \( hollywood arms \) and , to generations of movie musicalloving children , the only miss hannigan that a little orphan named annie ever really had to worry about but it is as a stellar performer on tv variety shows first as a regular on the garry moore show from 1959 to 1962 , then as the host of the carol burnett show from 1967 to 1978 that ms burnett , 82 , will always best be known a new 22disc dvd box set , just released by time life , compiles the best episodes from the first five seasons of the burnett show , none of which have been seen in decades \( the lost episodes , a 6disc dvd set out sept 15 , contains episodes that have not been seen since their original airing \) ms burnett , an emmy winner as well as the recipient of a special tony , the presidential medal of freedom , a kennedy center honor and the mark twain prize for humor , will receive the screen actors guild life achievement award in january these are edited excerpts from a conversation in which ms burnett spoke about the genesis of her classic variety show and her lasting influence on tv comedy it was unusual for a woman to get her own comedy variety tv show in the 1960s how did you get yours \? i had a 10year contract with cbs that i signed when i was leaving the garry moore show there was a clause that if within the first five years i wanted to do an hourlong variety show , all i had to do was push the button and cbs would have to put it on you waited almost five years to push that button when you did , how did the network respond \? i called new york and got one of the vice presidents of cbs on the phone he said , you know , carol , variety is a man s game it s really not for girls what did he want you to do instead \? he said , we 've got this great sitcom we 'd like to talk to you about called here s agnes' can you imagine \? i said no , variety is what i love i do n't want to be the same character every week i want to do different characters like i did on garry s show , and i want to have guest stars , i want to have music , i want to have dancers , singers , and i want a rep company like sid caesar had how did you put that rep company together \? when we started our show , we all said we need somebody like harvey korman , whom we 'd seen on danny kaye s show i just about attacked him in the parking lot at cbs i practically threw him over the hood of a parked car , and said , please , you 've got to be on our show ! were you ever intimidated by a huge guest star \? i was n't intimidated , but i was in awe bing crosby rita hayworth lana turner i was raised going to their movies with my grandmother my girlfriend and i would come home and we 'd play act the movies all of a sudden with the show , i could be betty grable with costumes and music and lighting i 'd get to be joan crawford were there ever any guests you wanted to have on but could n't get \? i wanted so badly to have bette davis on and she wanted to do it , but she wanted a lot of money and the producers said we ca n't make that exception , or else everybody else is going to want that amount of money one of the best things about your show was that if there was a mistake or an adlib during the taping , it stayed in on one episode in the dvd set , for instance , your wig falls off in a sketch and your guest star art carney said , that s the first time a woman s flipped her wig over me ! today , they would stop tape and put my wig back on ! my view was , i wanted to do it like a live show i wanted the danger there i wanted the feeling of spontaneity i wanted it to move really fast so that s what we did a comedy revue every week and i did n't want to have any long stops between sketches we would be out of there in two hours in fact we 'd be out in time to take our guest stars to dinner at chasen s how does it feel to be getting the sagaftra award \? wonderful but i'm a little nervous about it i 've watched the show on television before , like when dick van dyke got it , and they panned the audience , and i thought , oh my god , there s meryl streep ! there s brad pitt ! i have a feeling they 're going to be just as excited to see you fans like tina fey and amy poehler say you 've had a major effect on their careers how does that make you feel \? old ! when they say that , i get a little embarrassed , because they would be doing their thing whether or not i 'd ever been born it s a big compliment , but you have to just thank them and say ok , now you go influence somebody
newburyport , mass in the attempt to remain relevant to the next generation , the olympics are becoming a less exclusive club more sports were proposed this week for inclusion in the summer games in tokyo in 2020 baseball , softball , karate , surfing , skateboarding and sport climbing the s powerful executive board , which includes president thomas bach , must approve that list in december before the sports are put to a final vote next year , prior to the start of the in rio de janeiro but make no mistake the odds are greatly in favor of all the candidates' making the cut for 2020 this was no unilateral proposal from the tokyo organizing committee instead it came after plenty of consultation with the ioc leadership what the tokyo organizers surely wanted most were sports like baseball , softball and karate with deep roots in japanese culture and in which japanese can contend for medals what the ioc leadership wanted most was a credible youth movement , even at the risk of overloading a summer olympic program already creaking under the combined load of traditional mainstays \( track and field , swimming and gymnastics \) , global juggernauts \( soccer and basketball \) , niche diversions \( trampoline , and fencing \) and downright oddities \( modern pentathlon \) the package of rule changes dubbed that was passed last year created the possibility of a more flexible olympic program , and monday s announcement proves bach meant exactly what he advocated adding just surfing or sport climbing or skateboarding would have created a novelty ripple , like adding bmx racing in 2008 adding all three at one time risks going over the top but sends a much stronger message and is certainly more bold and generationshifting than simply reinstating baseball and softball , which were dropped after the 2008 games , and adding yet another martial art in karate this is really a very clever decision , said fernando aguerre , president of the there is the ultimate sport for young people on the beach and the ocean , which is surfing there is the ultimate urban youth sport , which is skateboarding and there is right now , the coolest , fastestexploding outdoor sport , which is sport climbing , so they have the beach culture covered , the urban culture covered and the outdoor culture covered , which are all key pieces of the youth culture isa research estimates that there are about 35 million surfers worldwide \( 2 million in japan \) , with 60 percent of those under age 20 research received by the ioc estimates that skateboarding has more than 50 million participants globally with a large majority under 18 until now , the winter games have been quicker to cater to youthful tastes , adding snowboarding in 1998 and more recently slopestyle but the summer games are already bursting at the seams , and what is missing so far are cuts adding sports to the olympics is a much less emotional process than removing them , as made clear by the uproar generated by wrestling s banishment from the rio games and the successful push to reinstate it there are already 28 sports inside the rings , including two new arrivals , rugby sevens and golf , for rio in 2016 but there is no serious suggestion for now of tossing anybody out of the club for 2020 to make room for the next wave instead the ioc plans to allow a maximum of 500 athletes from the five new sports in 2020 that will come on top of its cap for existing sports of approximately 10 , 500 the new sports would add 18 extra events we learned very much late in the process that they had created this cap of 500 athletes , said robert fasulo , the longtime consultant who is advising aguerre for me , a very clear part of the ioc strategy was to avoid a big fight with the existing federations this seems an untenable longterm strategy if the olympics are to remain manageable but at least for 2020 , this inclusive strategy should keep the stakeholders happy , even if it will only make it harder to command the spotlight with 33 sports and well over 300 medal events packed into 17 days the new candidates are certainly not the ones complaining about overcrowding in the marketplace in the last decade , sport climbing contested on artificial rock walls indoors or outdoors has grown exponentially it now has an estimated six million registered participants worldwide and another 25 million unregistered , with climbing walls existing in more than 140 countries at , a climbing gym in newburyport about 40 miles north of boston , general manager bryan rafferty has seen engagement levels soar in his five years in his post but he is convinced olympic status could take climbing to another level both for those in the industry and for those trying and generally failing to make a living as professional climbers they are some of the most talented and incredible athletes on the planet , rafferty said physically what they do is insane , and most of them are still scraping by on next to nothing aguerre , a gravelvoiced entrepreneur who has been the driving force behind surfing s long olympic campaign , was born and raised in mar del plata , argentina , before moving to the united states and cofounding reef , a sandal and surfwear company he became president of the isa in 1994 , got the federation recognized by the ioc in 1995 and then traveled to its headquarters in lausanne , switzerland , to present the late ioc president , juan antonio samaranch , with a surfboard it has still taken 20 more years to put surfing on the brink of the olympics , and it comes at a time when the ability to create artificial waves is fast approaching competition grade a this year , and a bigger one is set to open next year in austin , texas i think the technology is ready , aguerre said of course the experience of being and floating on the ocean is not the same it s not the same running 100 yards in the mountains on a trail and running on a track in a stadium of 50 , 000 people the experience is different , but the experience of riding the wave \? yes , yes , similar skateboarding , which made it onto the olympic short list despite issues about who should govern the sport , could join rock climbing in the urban center of tokyo in an edgier olympic environment than that provided by traditional street events like the marathon and the cycling road race the good idea here is to take the games to the people , instead of obliging the people to trek to a stadium some of the old olympic guard may catch the fever , too , with talk of a citycenter relay race in track and field it is also a bonus in a costconscious olympic era that none of the three youthtargeted sports on the tokyo list would require a permanent stadium but then there are no guarantees that any of them will be back on the olympic program after tokyo formally it s a onetime deal , aguerre said but we believe it s much easier to prove yourself once you 're inside the party and also so much harder to ask you to leave
in an interview with the indianapolis star on sunday , mike pence , the republican governor of indiana , tried to extricate himself from a cage of intolerance and divisiveness into which he had put himself and his state after coming under ferocious criticism from around the country , he said that he would now support legislation to clarify that the state s new religious freedom restoration act , which he signed into law last week , would not discriminate against gays and lesbians supporters of the law , which prevents the state from substantially burdening a person s exercise of religion , say it protects the rights of people and business owners from compromising their religious beliefs opponents say it opens the door to discrimination under the law , for example , a business owner who objects to birth control on religious grounds apparently ca n't be compelled to sell contraceptives one who objects to homosexuality on similar grounds would not be compelled to provide services to a gay person or a samesex couple more than 10 , 000 people have signed petitions against the bill and that was just last week arn tellem , the sports agent , urged in an email last week to the new york times that the indiana pacers , the and the professional sports leagues not only condemn this blatantly unconstitutional legislation , but also to take forceful action against it by reevaluating their short and longterm plans in the state one of tellem s clients is jason collins , the former nba player who became the first professional athlete in the four major american team sports to publicly come out as gay while active asked if he had expected such an intense backlash to the bill , pence told the star i just ca n't account for the hostility that s been directed at our state i 've been taken aback by the mischaracterizations from outside the state of indiana about what is in this bill mischaracterizations from outside the state \? pence sounds like just another in the string of segregationists from an earlier era george wallace , the governor of alabama lester maddox , the governor of georgia and orval faubus , the governor of arkansas they said marches against their segregationist policies were a result of outside agitators , often implying that the blacks in their states were content with the status quo the problem , to them , was n't racism the problem was outsiders here we are in 2015 , with a governor erecting more barriers and claiming to be misunderstood by the world trust me , we understand many of us have watched this movie before back in the day , it was black and white now it s in multilayered , multifaceted technicolor the governor s timing is impeccable indeed , many of the outsiders will become insiders later this week as thousands of fans head to indianapolis for the annual spring ritual known as the men s basketball final four the governor might as well put signs at airports , train stations and highways saying , gays allowed but not welcome to its credit , the ncaa , based in indianapolis , responded immediately if not definitively to the law s passage the organization s president , mark emmert , said in a statement that the ncaa was deeply committed to providing an inclusive environment for all our events we are especially concerned about how this legislation could affect our studentathletes and employees , emmert said we will work diligently to assure studentathletes competing in , and visitors attending , next week s men s final four in indianapolis are not impacted negatively by this bill moving forward , we intend to closely examine the implications of this bill and how it might affect future events as well as our work force sports have not always been the epicenter of enlightenment daniel murphy of the mets embarrassed major league baseball and himself last month when , after being asked about billy bean , a former major league player who said he was gay after retiring , he told njcom i do disagree with his lifestyle i do disagree with the fact the billy is a homosexual he felt that way , he said , because he is trying to surrender to christ in my own life last year , when michael sam became the first publicly gay player to be drafted by an nfl team , some players expressed discomfort with the idea of having a gay teammate so be it everyone has an opinion problems develop when opinions drive policy or when bigotry becomes law it s too late for the ncaa to pull this year s final four out of indianapolis , but the organization can make sure none of its championships are held in the state until the law is scrapped , or at least modified to ensure that no business is given the legal right to discriminate in signing , and then promoting , a bill that opens the door for discrimination , pence has encouraged a divisiveness that is antithetical to the achievements represented by the four teams who have reached indianapolis though much is wrong with sports today including recruiting violations , poor graduation rates and rampant commercialism sports remain , for fans , an escape from rigors of daily life this is especially true at tournament and playoff time the best teams put aside egos , vanities and prejudices to achieve a shared goal they put aside differences , and in some cases that could mean their sexuality , to a become a melting pot of everyone s higher self that s not sports , that s life governor pence promised to clarify the intent of the law this week he 'd best hurry the posse is headed to indianapolis
becket , mass for about 10 fairly good minutes of moi les autres , the four performers of \( the other coast \) share the stage in equal measure and at close quarters the dancer myriam allard , the guitarist caroline plant , the percussionist miguel medina and the vocalist hedi graja flamenco rhythms and sonorities pour forth this is flamenco nuevo , from montreal ms allard never wears the fulllength skirts associated with flamenco dancing and eschews its more glamorously statuesque arm positions , ms plant gives us none of the sensuousness of the flamenco guitar sound , and mr graja avoids its vocal flourishes this is the second visit of la otra orilla , which was founded in 2006 , to the doris duke theater at jacob s pillow , where moi les autres \( me and the others \) is having its world premiere this week though the program has no credit for d cor , the look of the rear wall is among the evening s most striking components , with tienne boucher s lighting changing the backdrop from a flamehued silverpaper landscape to a powerfully fairylighted treescape costumes are by marianne th riault \( everyone gets through two or more outfits during the evening , which is without intermission \) ms allard , who starts in bright redheeled shoes with tight trousers , ends in a pinkandred short dress mr graja at times sports a long nautical yellow coat ms plant ends up in a tullepetticoated alice \( wonderland \) dress and mr medina does his biggest drumming number in an allwhite ensemble some of those visual elements are refreshing , or at least fun over all , though , moi is pretentious and irksome it s fine to jettison the old accouterments of flamenco , but what replaces them \? in one sketch , mr medina reads a quasiphilosophical english memoir aloud until ms plant interrupts him by throwing herself at his torso ms allard s face embellishes her seldomsubtle dancing with oeillades and moues one guitar number for ms plant , who sits on an officetype chair with wheels , becomes a game in which mr medina and mr graja , pretending to fight , push her around the space since her music is unremarkable , this is an especially thin sequence \( less thin , though , than the coarse bangbash noisiness of mr medina s drumming \) as the show ends , the four performers do a slow twostep to yvette giraud s 1954 recording of the sentimental \( irving gordon s unforgettable in french \) the most harmless part of the evening , it s as pointless as everything else here why does the printed program claim that this company embodies and celebrates the timeless and universal appeal of flamenco \? so much of the danced program demonstrates the reverse
united nations within days , diplomats here say , the security council is expected to unanimously endorse the agreement reached in vienna that aims to contain s ability to build a nuclear bomb will that consensus among the world powers shape the council s ability to contain conflicts that are killing and maiming people across the middle east \? most certainly but exactly what the agreement s repercussions will be in places like and , and on the conflict between the israelis and palestinians , is a big unknown the agreement will lift painful economic sanctions on iran in exchange for guarantees that its nuclear activities remain peaceful supporters of the deal say it will ease , over the longterm , the underlying tensions in the region critics say it stands to sharpen the deadly regional rivalry between iran , the dominant shiite power , and the sunni powerhouse , not to mention israel its prime minister regards iran as israel s principal regional enemy and has called the nuclear agreement an egregious mistake the security council resolution will formally approve the nuclear accord and detail the conditions for lifting its longstanding sanctions against iran the american ambassador , samantha power , circulated a 14page draft to council members on wednesday morning under the draft , sanctions can automatically be reimposed if any of the council s five permanent members believe that iran is violating its obligations in what one diplomat described as a creative twist , the council would need to take a vote to stop the sanctions from snapping back that effectively gives the united states the upper hand , since its veto would make sure that the sanctions are reimposed diplomats said a vote on the draft resolution could be scheduled as early as sunday the measure would take effect 90 days from passage , so as to allow enough time for congress to consider it and for president obama to veto any disapproval , if necessary passage of the resolution , which is considered inevitable every comma in the draft was negotiated by diplomats in vienna is likely to have an immediate bearing on civilians who have nothing to do with the diplomatic bargains first , there is yemen saudi arabia was deeply anxious about iran s growing influence in the region well before the nuclear agreement was finalized and saudi arabia s western allies , including the united states , britain and france three of the six participants in the nuclear negotiations \( china , germany and russia being the others \) are likely to want to soothe the kingdom s fears and in turn refrain from exerting a great deal of pressure on the saudis' crippling airstrikes over yemen indeed , assuaging the saudis may partly explain why none of the world powers have pressed for a ceasefire in the yemen conflict despite mounting casualties and the threat of famine it s clearly a difficult moment for saudi arabia , a senior security council diplomat said after the iran nuclear pact was announced on tuesday we will continue to offer what we can advice , support privately second , the iran agreement is also likely to further constrain the security council from spurring peace talks between the israelis and the , given israel s avowed antipathy toward iran france , a permanent member , had tried to get the council involved this year but israel dismissed that suggestion , and the united states , having expressed no enthusiasm earlier , could be reluctant to put any additional pressure on israel third , iran s new relationship with the world powers is also sure to influence any attempts to resolve the war in syria iran is syria s most crucial backer , and it remains to be seen whether it will harden or soften its stance , now that it has struck a deal with some of the most powerful foreign foes of syria s president , bashar alassad either way , said lina khatib , director of the carnegie middle east center in beirut , the world powers should seize the momentum of the nuclear deal to nudge iran toward one on peace trust may be shortlived , she argued , and anyway , the battlefield losses are piling up for mr assad s forces , making it worthwhile for even his staunchest backers to consider an exit strategy there is a sense of urgency , ms khatib argued , which gives the international community an opening to use the increased trust , which is going to be one of the outcomes of the nuclear deal , to start reaching out to iran on syria critics of the obama administration , including ms khatib , have said its focus on winning a nuclear deal has come at the cost of taking a stronger line against the assad government , a claim that american officials have vigorously denied they insist that the syria negotiations and nuclear talks have been handled on separate tracks it did not go unnoticed that president obama made no mention of the syria conflict in his speech on tuesday all the while , the death toll inside syria has soared past 220 , 000 the war has spilled over its borders , helped to spawn the islamic state , and created a growing refugee crisis four million people have fled syria , and tens of thousands of them have tried to cross the mediterranean sea on flimsy boats in an effort to reach safety in europe the security council has been paralyzed to stop the war the next test of council cooperation on syria is likely to come next week , when it is expected to vote on a measure that would create a new panel to determine who has been using chlorine as a weapon on the battlefield in syria the united states drafted the measure , insisting all the while that mr assad s forces have been dropping barrel bombs filled with chlorine gas , which is illegal under international law russia has insisted on the involvement of the organization for the prohibition of chemical weapons , the monitor of the treaty banning their use the syria draft resolution , in an apparent nod to russian concerns , proposes a panel run jointly by the secretary general and the weapons organization to be sure , the nuclear deal does not mean the united states and iran will necessarily cooperate on regional crises in which both have vital interests as important as it will be to put iran s nuke ambitions in the box , that will not solve our regional problem with iran , said derek chollet , a former pentagon and state department official and now with the german marshall fund of the united states , a research organization the administration is very wideeyed on that , he added what the iran negotiations have already shown is the degree to which russia and the west can collaborate when each country s national interests are aligned russia agreed to the iran nuclear pact , including the snapback mechanism to reimpose sanctions , out of its own interest russia is a key partner in the security council , but a very demanding , difficult , painful partner , a second council diplomat said as richard gowan , a fellow at new york university s center on international cooperation , argued last week in the runup to the final deal , even a show of bigpower cooperation in a moment of deep uncertainty might stop the sense of creeping chaos in the international system
to the sports editor re , yankee who built his stardom 90 percent on skill and half on wit , dies at 90 , sept 24 my love of baseball began in 1955 when i tried out for a seattle little league team , and i went on to success through high school yogi berra was in his heyday throughout those years i accumulated topps baseball cards with the same enthusiasm i collect postal history today i coveted yogi , mickey mantle , whitey ford , moose skowron and other yankee cards throughout my adolescence and would trade none of them away my mother dispatched my collection when i was away at college , an act of violence i could never quite forgive one of the last gentlemen of the game , perhaps of any game , has departed at the same time i 've lost a bit of myself today , i am compelled to pause at the fork in the road that this witty and immortal catcher once suggested we all take to the sports editor several years ago i planned a baseballthemed bar mitzvah party coincidentally , yogi berra happened to walk into the country club where the party was being held , and when he saw a lifesize cardboard standup of himself in the lobby , he went upstairs to see what was going on imagine the surprise of the entire party when yogi berra walked in he was extremely personable and friendly and stayed to sign autographs for everyone the bar mitzvah boy was starstruck in his kindness , yogi created a day this 13yearold boy will never forget  to the sports editor i feel privileged to have grown up a few blocks from yogi s house in montclair , nj , and had the even greater privilege of being the personal recipient of a yogiism when i was a boy while i was playing at a friend s house , my toy rocket arched over stonebridge road and landed in the bushes in yogi s yard as i was searching through the brush , a voice gruffly asked what i was doing when i explained , yogi looked me over and said , well , when you see it , you 'll know you found it , and walked off those words have resonated with me for almost 50 years because on a much higher level , people struggle to define just what it is they are looking for in personal and challenging areas like joy , faith and love but let s face it when you see it , you know you found it  to the sports editor there are so many great yogi berra stories , most of them apocryphal , that added to his legend my favorite concerns the afternoon yogi came home from the ballpark , looking forward to dinner , but found no one there finally , carmen and the children returned where you been \? he asked i took the kids to see dr zhivago , ' she replied oh , what s wrong with them now \? yogi complained
for the past five years i have been visiting the world s largest refugee camp , a city made of mud and sticks the size of new orleans called dadaab , in northeastern kenya the camp was established in 1991 as a temporary refuge for around 90 , 000 people fleeing somalia s civil war today it is home to half a million at first , i was blown away by the fact of its existence how could this place still be here \? and how could the world allow all these people to stay in this baking hot limbo , unable to work and unable to leave , to spend their whole lives in an open prison \? but five years later , after following residents through their daily lives and listening to their hopes and fears , i have came to a very different realization dadaab is not an anachronism , or a hangover from a former world order it is the future it was n't supposed to be this way dadaab was created as a shortterm haven where the international community could house and feed displaced people until a durable solution could be found under the principles set out by the united nations high commissioner for refugees , this meant refugees would stay in the camp until one of three things happened they returned to their country of origin were integrated into their new host country , in this case , kenya or were offered resettlement to a third country , usually in europe or the united states there are nearly 400 , 000 somali refugees living in dadaab for whom none of these outcomes is likely they are among the 14 million refugees living in what the united nations calls protracted situations , those in exile for more than five years the global displaced population is now at 60 million , but this appalling number masks another crisis that has been brewing out of the headlines for the past decade the explosion in protracted refugees rich nations are accepting fewer refugees through the formal united nations resettlement program host nations such as pakistan , jordan and kenya have balked at integrating any of the refugees in their camps and so , with no prospect of an end to refugee status , many who can afford it are pursuing the illegal journey to europe but these are a fraction of the total for a vast majority , refugee camps are becoming , increasingly , permanent no one wants to admit this not the countries that must host them , not the united nations , which must pay for them , and least of all the refugees themselves , who must live there this makes for strange contradictions in dadaab , the kenyan government forbids permanent structures , so when the standardissue united nations tents turn gray and ragged as they inevitably do after two rainy seasons in the desert , refugees build homes of red mud over frames of thorns water still comes from temporary tap stands , and toilets are still holes in the ground but social life does not stand still the camp has democratic elections , football leagues , cinemas , hotels , generators providing informal power and a market trading in smuggled goods and surplus united nations rations that turns over 25 million a year kenya , like many host nations , does not allow refugees to work , so the united nations must continue to ship over 5 , 000 tons of food each month , mainly rice and beans , to this inhospitable stretch of desert currently , though , because of budget constraints , rations in dadaab have been cut by 30 percent dadaab may be the world s largest , but there are many other examples of these temporarybutpermanent cities in pakistan , along the border with afghanistan , the camps founded in 1979 for afghan refugees are now a string of 79 permanent slums run by the united nations and home to nearly a million people hundreds of thousands of refugees from darfur have been living in a collection of 12 camps across the border in chad since 2004 , with no end in sight similar numbers and situations exist in ethiopia , south sudan , thailand , lebanon , yemen , jordan , turkey and elsewhere , where people are living , and reproducing , in limbo the numbers are growing not only because of a world in turmoil , but also because whole generations are growing up in camps gaza is perhaps the best example of this the eight original refugee camps have morphed into towns that , together , are now one of the most densely populated areas in the world , home to 17 million people separate from the unhcr and with a different mandate , the united nations relief and works agency for refugees in the near east was founded in 1949 for around 750 , 000 arab palestinians forced to flee their homes in 1948 but with no peace deal or return in sight , the agency looks after their five million descendants at a cost to the international community of over 1 billion a year the agency was supposed to be an exception , but gaza now looks like the rule in dadaab , the united nations resettles around 2 , 000 refugees annually to europe , australia , canada and the united states but the birthrate in the camp of 1 , 000 a month will always outstrip that effort as refugee populations spiral higher , host nations usually move toward ever stricter encampment policies kenya is one of the strictest last year the police rounded up thousands of refugees found outside designated camps and incarcerated them in the national stadium pakistan has threatened several times not to renew refugee status for afghan refugees , and periodically attempts to force people back to afghanistan in jordan , refugees have the right to move and work in theory , but authorities have reportedly issued no new work permits since 2014 and have begun coercive administrative measures to keep them in the camps to leave dadaab , residents require a movement pass , just like under apartheid acquiring one usually involves a bribe thus , members of the third generation that is now beginning life in dadaab may well spend their whole life in the camp if they win one of the fiercely contested slots at secondary school , they could gain diplomas and degrees online or through the mail , but when there s no viable path to a free future elsewhere , education in the closed camp is a cruel trick there are no jobs except volunteer positions with the aid agencies that run the hospitals , schools and social programs , and these pay a fraction of what kenyan staff members receive for doing the same job one might expect that in such circumstances , talent would curdle into bitterness , but the most striking thing about dadaab is that the miserable conditions do not seem to have engendered radicalization people are frustrated , but until now , the isolation of the camp and the united nations mantras on rights and gender balance have fostered a subdued but tolerant society in which women are more emancipated than their sisters back in somalia this is the ultimate contradiction of camp life how to locate hope for the future in a desperate situation that appears permanent people are trying life in dadaab and all the other camps is a daily exercise in manufacturing hope but for many , the fiction of temporariness no longer holds and we are seeing the results of that realization washing up on europe s beaches separate enclaves are beginning to appear in the rich world , too slums such as the jungle in calais , where refugees and migrants wait to try to enter britain illegally , or the detention centers that are now common in europe , australia and the united states where people must wait sometimes for years while their status is determined in a world centered on nationstates , the full range of human rights is increasingly unavailable to those without citizenship a whole gray population of secondclass citizens has emerged , and their numbers are growing the proper and legal response should be to allow refugees and asylum seekers freedom of movement within their host nations and all the rights accorded to other citizens , including the right to travel abroad and seek work legally but the tide of public opinion in most countries is moving in the opposite direction of course rich nations should take more but even if europe and the united states stepped up and admitted much larger numbers than the paltry offers that have been suggested in recent weeks , it would still make only a small dent in the global refugee population until our current wars die down , the world needs to adjust to the new reality of permanent refugee cities in legal limbo even if host nations wish to deny citizenship to longstaying refugees , it would make sense to allow the united nations and refugees themselves to invest in infrastructure to reduce disease , provide employment and make these ramshackle slums more habitable they could perhaps become autonomous open cities or international zones where those with united nations documents were permitted to move and trade within the normal international visa regime if camps were economically viable they might at least offer some pull to remain there as one man told me as i was nearing the end of my time in dadaab i belong nowhere my country is the republic of refugee
douglasville , ga in an unusual legal maneuver , the district attorney in this suburb of atlanta said monday that he had won indictments against 15 supporters of the confederate battle flag , accusing them of violating the state s antistreetgang statute during a confrontation with black partygoers in july prosecutors say that members of the group , which calls itself respect the flag , threatened a group of blacks attending an outdoor birthday party on july 25 a cellphone video of part of the episode shows several white men driving away from the party in a convoy of pickup trucks with the confederate battle flag and other banners , including american flags , fluttering from the truck beds the partygoers contend that members of the flag group yelled racial slurs and displayed a crowbar , a knife and either a rifle or a shotgun , according to the southern poverty law center , a civil rights group in montgomery , ala , that is representing some of the accusers the douglas county district attorney , brian fortner , a white republican elected to the office in 2014 , announced the indictments in a news conference monday morning each of the 15 was indicted on one count of making terroristic threats and a second count of unlawfully participating in criminal gang activity mr fortner , whose county has transformed from predominantly white to decidedly mixed over the past two decades , said that the georgia statute upon which the second charge is based , the street gang terrorism and prevention act , was worded very broadly to deal with any type of activity that occurs with a group that s organized that commits a crime none of the accused had been arraigned as of monday , and it was not clear if they had lawyers representing them by monday afternoon , none of them had applied for representation with the county public defenders' office but a member of the group told a local newspaper that the black partygoers started the confrontation several criminal lawyers and legal scholars said monday that they could not recall other instances in which a state antigang statute had been used to prosecute a confederate heritage group in the deep south the first version of georgia s antigang law was passed in 1992 at the behest of atlanta s police chief at the time , eldrin bell the state s general assembly , in the law s statement of intent , noted that citizens retained their rights to freedom of expression and association but it also declared that georgia was in a state of crisis which has been caused by violent criminal street gangs whose members threaten , terrorize and commit a multitude of crimes against the peaceful citizens of their neighborhoods pickup trucks flying confederatethemed flags have become a regular sight in many parts of the south since june , when a white gunman , apparently influenced by racist doctrine , massacred a subsequent effort by some elected officials in the region to from public spaces has provoked a strong negative reaction from some white southerners , who argue that the symbols are a part of their history and heritage the indictments were handed up friday by a grand jury in douglas county , a fastgrowing county a few miles west of atlanta that is about 52 percent white and 44 percent black suburban sprawl and the steady migration of blacks out of the city s core have caused striking social and demographic change here in 1990 , blacks made up only about 8 percent of the population , according to census figures the antigang law defines a criminal street gang as any organization , association or group of three or more persons associated in fact , whether formal or informal , that engages in or conspires to commit a defined set of serious criminal acts the law gives prosecutors numerous ways to define the existence of a gang , including sharing signs , symbols , tattoos , graffiti or common activities critics challenged the law on first amendment grounds , but it was upheld by the georgia supreme court in 2009 ronald l carlson , a law professor at the university of georgia , said that georgia s law was generally in line with other state antigang statutes around the country but mr carlson also said that he expected lawyers for the defendants to file pretrial motions to dismiss the counts and argue that the identification of their clients as gang members was a stretch leeanne lynch , a public defender in dekalb county , ga , who was among the lawyers who unsuccessfully challenged the law s constitutionality , said monday that she continued to believe that the law was overly broad she said small groups of people could be defined as a gang just because they were wearing certain types of clothes or have a group motto that they share ms lynch said that the law had been used to prosecute members of rap groups who have some affiliation with criminal gangs , but are not gang members themselves prosecutors , she said , often use the statute to load up charges on defendants to pressure them to agree to a plea deal morris dees , the founder of the southern poverty law center and its chief trial lawyer , could not recall seeing an antigang statute used against this kind of group in the past but he said it was a very good use of the statute i do n't know why it has n't been used before , he said mr fortner said that some of the men involved in the episode had been arrested , and others would be arrested soon in a in the atlanta journalconstitution , a member of the group who was named in the indictments , levi bush , said that the partygoers yelled at some members of his group as they drove by partygoers then threw rocks at his truck , he said mr bush , in a brief phone interview on monday , denied that he had broken the law i speak for me and everybody else we are not guilty in these charges , he said he declined to elaborate two members of the group , joe eric hood and thomas summers , were each also indicted on an unrelated count of battery stemming from an episode at a gas station called the corn crib mr fortner said the accuser was white , but declined to comment further the party occurred on a saturday at the home of melissa alford , 44 on monday , ms alford showed the side street where , she said , the trucks had pulled over and begun to harass her guests she said she saw one of them with a rifle or shotgun , and heard one racial epithet used she said that none of her guests threw rocks ms alford said that she worked with atrisk youth as part of a nonprofit she founded some of them , she said , have been identified by the authorities as gang members she said the men in the trucks deserved the same treatment just like the crips , she said , if they 're out there doing some foolishness like this , they 're going to get charged
west hollywood , calif this city was one of the first in the nation to pass a law it was one of the first communities viewed as a haven for gay people when the city was incorporated in 1984 , a majority of the city council members were openly gay , helping earn west hollywood the nickname the gay camelot even today , it has rainbowcolored crosswalks now , west hollywood has joined the vanguard of places that are taking steps to make transgender people feel more welcome last week , an ordinance took effect that abolished the traditional designation of men or women on singlestall public restrooms , a bow to the requests of the sizable community of transgender people , who do not believe they fall into either category restaurants and other places with public restrooms will not have to make any changes if the bathrooms have multiple stalls , but all singlestall public restrooms have to be labeled gender neutral businesses have 60 days to comply , but can do so by simply placing a genderneutral sign on any singlestall restroom genderspecific restrooms can be unwelcoming and potentially unsafe for many people whose gender identity falls outside of traditional gender norms , according to a issued by the government of west hollywood , a city widely known as weho shifting from genderspecific singlestall restrooms to genderneutral ones is a simple and lowcost way to help ensure that facilities in the city of west hollywood are welcoming and open to all people , regardless of the way one presents or identifies their gender identity in this case , the city was not entirely a groundbreaker washington , dc , passed similar legislation in 2006 , and in the past two years several other communities including philadelphia austin , tex and multnomah county , ore , where portland is have passed laws requiring genderneutral bathrooms this sweep of legislation reflects the growing prominence and visibility of transgender people amazon studios s streaming show transparent has received widespread critical acclaim , and the lead actor , jeffrey tambor , a last sunday for his performance as a man who identifies as a woman when it came to the restroom designations , it felt like , oh my goodness , this is something that is important to do , to be inclusive and to also be a leader , said abbe land , the city councilor in west hollywood who led the effort we hope the rest of the country will adopt similar ordinances before passing the ordinance , city leaders consulted with business leaders who expressed concern about the costs the requirement could place on restaurants this level of cooperation stands in contrast to the city council s 2011 to ban sales of fur clothing , which angered many local retailers the chamber s concern was that it would not be onerous on businesses in terms of costly remodels , said keith kaplan , a vice chairman of the west hollywood chamber of commerce we worked with the city to develop plans that provide safe and comfortable facilities for the transgender community , he added the city council unanimously approved the law amid debate over how to balance the city s historically gay character with changing demographics and mainstream acceptance of gay culture in los angeles at large last year , this debate manifested itself when john duran , a council member who is openly gay , pushed to have a rainbow flag removed from atop city hall , arguing that it might make heterosexual residents feel undervalued after vociferous protests , the city flag was redesigned to include a rainbow color scheme , in a compromise for many businesses in west hollywood , the restroom ordinance simply reflects facts on the ground with a busy restaurant , it has been common practice for the past 15 years for people to use whichever singlestall restroom is available , said mark farrell , manager of marix , a texmex restaurant that has been in business for 30 years when there s an empty single stall and 10 guys waiting , well , it s something that just kind of happened genderneutral restroom laws vary slightly from one city to another none of them currently require modifying existing restrooms , beyond signage , though most require all future construction plans , via building codes , to create a certain number of genderneutral facilities this is a very minor change that creates very significant progress because everybody needs safe and reliable access to the restroom , said alison gill , senior legislative counsel for the human rights campaign , a group that focuses on lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender rights
is a 999 percent conviction rate something to be proud of , or a sign of a deeply flawed justice system \? in china , where only who faced trial in 2013 were found not guilty , it is surely the latter last year , chinese courts reheard more than 1 , 300 cases and corrected errors in many of them far too late , in at least one case the 1996 execution of an 18yearold mongolian man named huugjilt , who , , had been wrongfully convicted of rape and murder on march 12 , zhou qiang , the president of the supreme people s court , to cut back on wrongful convictions , which are epidemic in a legal system that provides almost none of the rights or protections to accused people that are taken for granted in much of the world we deeply reproach ourselves for letting wrongful convictions happen , mr zhou said in his annual report to parliament while huugjilt s execution was the trigger for mr zhou s latest appeal , there are of wrongful convictions for instance , when murder victims show up alive and well years after their killer was convicted and sent to prison a major reason for china s astonishing conviction rate is the police s overwhelming reliance on confessions of guilt and the wide latitude they have in extracting them detained suspects do not have an explicit right to remain silent , and the police may use compulsory measures to interrogate them , without any lawyer present , for up to 12 hours \( in cases involving major corruption , national security and terrorism , defendants a lawyer for months \) while torture and other coercive techniques are technically outlawed , and there is a rule excluding illegally obtained evidence from trial , defendants rarely succeed in keeping coerced confessions out china has made advances to its justice system in the past several decades , but if he is truly committed to reforming these abhorrent practices mr zhou must push for for starters , the courts and the police are not independent agencies but instruments of the communist party , which makes it very difficult to get them to operate according to any clear rule of law in addition , the police who already wield disproportionate power , and whose own careers are often advanced by how many convictions they help obtain have every incentive to do whatever it takes to procure as many confessions as possible they will not change their behavior until there are real consequences for engaging in torture , abuse and coercion finally , prisoners should enjoy the presumption of innocence if china wishes to be a credible world power , it must get in step with international norms of criminal justice and begin treating its citizens with the fairness and dignity due to those who face the prosecutorial power of the state
there are new revelations from the continuing insideclimate news investigation of what the oil industry knew about the potential climate impacts of carbon dioxide from fuel burning even as it sought delays in related national and international policies the headline and deck on today s story neatly summarize the news exxon s oil industry peers knew about climate dangers in the 1970s , too members of an american petroleum institute task force on co2 included scientists from nearly every major oil company , including exxon , texaco and shell below you can read my proposal for what the industry might do to make the best use of its deep knowledge of carbon dioxide and climate change , along with its scientific and technical capacity here s a snippet from neela banerjee s article , but please read the rest at the link below the american petroleum institute together with the nation s largest oil companies ran a task force to monitor and share climate research between 1979 and 1983 , indicating that the oil industry , not just exxon alone , was aware of its possible impact on the world s climate far earlier than previously known the group s members included senior scientists and engineers from nearly every major us and multinational oil and gas company , including exxon , mobil , amoco , phillips , texaco , shell , sunoco , and sohio , according to internal documents obtained by insideclimate news and interviews with the task force s former director  my thoughts on the series earlier findings are here  all of this bolsters a notion i first floated awhile ago on twitter , related to a 1978 proposal by an exxon scientist , harold n weinberg maybe exxonmobil can answer weinberg s 78 call by filling rdd gap on scalable co2 removal http tco eqo5mmdmfn http tco 6ekhcbqtxi  andy revkin \( revkin \) 18 oct 15 in a memo to superiors , revealed in insideclimate s earlier reporting , weinberg wrote what would be more appropriate than for the world s leading energy company and leading oil company to take the lead in trying to define whether a longterm co2 problem really exists and , if so , what counter measures would be appropriate the proposal was not embraced , needless to say while others pursue investigations that may or may not bear fruit \( but will surely enrich several generations of lawyers \) , i have an idea for something that could start now i suggest that exxon , and perhaps the fossil fuel industry more generally , might help propel a vigorous new burst of research in ways to take back the co2 added to the atmosphere by fossil fuel combustion at a scale that would matter to the climate system \( those of us who benefitted from decades of cheap fossil fuels can do our part by supporting boosted federal investments in cleanenergy science and technology development and , yes , deployment \) after all , the putative trajectories for avoiding dangerous climate change that were the centerpiece of discussions and pledges in the paris climate treaty talks all rely on asyetuntested massive atmospheric co2 removal sometime late in this century at the same time , none of the pledges in the paris agreement are focused on developing the capacity to do anything of that sort in coming decades that was the reality gap i wrote about \( the innovation initiatives announced there by the obama administration and bill gates and others are a great start , but just a start \) here s what an exxon promotional logo might look like once the company embraces this notion in late november , i had an initial email exchange about this notion with kenneth p cohen , exxon s vice president for public and government affairs he responded , we actually have some very interesting promising work underway in the co2 capture area , but couldn t elaborate at the time i m looking forward to hearing more here are articles describing the kinds of efforts i m thinking about all of which are very different than simply catching and compressing co2 from smokestacks and pumping it into the ground \( a process that remains a pipe dream at anything approaching the necessary scale \)  learning to love co2 companies and academics seek out profitable pathways to materials made from the unwanted gas \( alex scott , chemical and engineering news , nov 16 , 2015 \)  startups have figured out how to remove carbon from the air will anyone pay them to do it \? \( marc gunther , the guardian , july 14 , 2015 \)  can sucking co2 out of the atmosphere really work \? \( eli kintisch , technology review , oct 7 , 2014 \) i was heartened to see an excellent piece posted by the conversation on dec 12 on the notion of a co2 takeback scheme  the essay is by myles allen , an oxford university climatologist who was a leader of research developing a carbon budget as a way to gauge global warming solutions and has since 2013 pressed for intensified work on capturing co2 here s an excerpt and link to stabilize temperatures at any level , be it 15 , 2 or even 3 , net carbon dioxide emissions must be reduced to zero most governments , environmental groups and business leaders now understand this and it is acknowledged , albeit implicitly , in article 4 of the paris agreement , which calls for greenhouse emissions to be balanced by carbon sinks some time after midcentury but we re unlikely to hit net zero emissions before temperatures reach 2 , and even less likely before they reach 15 warming is currently at about 1 and rising by 01 every five to ten years we could slow the warming by reducing emissions , of course but if we fail to reduce at the required rate and the inadequate emissions targets indicate this is the intention then we will be left with no option but to scrub the excess co2 back out of the atmosphere in future owners of fossil fuel assets that is why the deal is like a gigantic takeback scheme the proof lies in what is not said in the paris agreement there is no explicit mention of a global carbon budget for instance , which adds up total emissions since the industrial revolution that is despite the fact that all governments have acknowledged , through the intergovernmental panel on climate change , the reality that stabilising temperatures requires a limit on cumulative co2 emissions certain countries simply cannot accept the suggestion that they may be obliged to leave some of their prized fossil carbon reserves underground and why should they \?

baghdad iraqi officials said tuesday that a combined force of iraqi soldiers and allied shiite militias had started moving to retake the city of ramadi , the capital of anbar province , from islamic state fighters the officials billed the operation that began tuesday as the start of a major offensive to liberate all of anbar province but most of the action reported on tuesday involved progovernment forces maneuvering in the desert areas north and east of ramadi , and it was unclear when an assault there might begin the loss of ramadi more than a week ago was a major setback for the iraqi government and the united statesled air campaign to contain the islamic state , also known as or isil the city was one of the last major areas where sunni arab fighters had worked with the army to try to hold out against the sunni jihadists of the islamic state in a statement broadcast on state television tuesday , s defense ministry , referring to the government umbrella organization for the largely shiite militias , said , the operation to liberate anbar has started with the cooperation of the iraqi army and the popular mobilization forces any broader campaign for anbar iraq s sunni arab heartland , and a longtime focus of the islamic state s ambitions is likely to be long and bloody the difficulties of the campaign were underscored in comments over the weekend by the united states defense secretary , ashton b carter , who said the iraqi forces in ramadi had shown no will to fight and had fled those comments were harshly received by officials in baghdad and among soldiers in the field a combination of iraqi security forces and allied sunni tribal fighters had resisted the islamic state for nearly a year in ramadi before withdrawing in the face of a barrage of suicide attacks the progovernment forces in that fight vastly outnumbered the islamic state militants , but iraqi officials have called the retreat a tactical decision for the exhausted forces to regroup it was a tactical retreat from ramadi , said col fakhry abdullah , who leads a unit of iraqi army soldiers manning mortar positions in garma , a frontline town in anbar referring to mr carter s comments , colonel abdullah added , in the coming days , we will prove to him that he was wrong and we were right even so , the performance of the iraqi security forces so far , along with mr carter s comments , raised questions about the united states' strategy for fighting the islamic state the united states has been training iraqi army recruits since december , though none of the soldiers trained so far have entered the battle american officials have also pushed prime minister haider alabadi to increase aid to the sunni tribes who were fighting the militants in anbar and to avoid sending shiite militiamen into that fight , fearing that it could intensify sectarian hostilities but sunni tribesmen around ramadi complained for weeks that government aid and reinforcements were too slow , and now the shiite militias are taking a central role in preparing for an offensive in anbar since ramadi s fall , the united states has eased its line on the use of shiite militias , saying it will still provide air support for a militialed campaign in anbar as long as the shiite groups remain firmly under the control of mr abadi s government the operation that began tuesday was taking place partly in salahuddin province , to take areas north and east of ramadi before pushing into anbar , said ahmed alassadi , the spokesman for the popular mobilization forces the operation , he said , was named for a revered shiite religious figure , imam hussein , which signified the crucial role the shiite militias are now playing in the security of the country
building wonders , a within the pbs show nova , tries hard to take the miraculousness out of three formidable ancient structures but , happily , it fails if anything , the programs leave you even more impressed with their subjects the colosseum , the stone city of petra and hagia sophia how did they build make do that \? is , of course , a longstanding parlor game with all sorts of ancient structures , whether the pyramids of egypt or machu picchu in peru each program tries to go beyond the theoretical and explore practical aspects of the guessing game , beginning on wednesday with the colosseum in rome the concern is n't so much the construction of the colosseum , but the staging of the elaborate , gory entertainments supposedly held there could the ancient romans really flood the arena and float ships in it \? did wild animals really materialize to devour unfortunate victims \? to test the wildanimal possibilities , a research team builds a lifting mechanism like the romans might have used to bring lions and such up from beneath the floor of the arena eventually the team gets it to work , but not without considerable difficulty obstacles are encountered in the experiments in the other two programs as well the examination of in jordan , with its remarkable carved facades , includes an effort by presentday stone carvers to transform a rock face in similar fashion , but they quickly resort to a modern shortcut in the episode on , the imposing domed structure in istanbul that has been a church and a mosque and is now a museum , a crew has all kinds of trouble trying to build a miniature version to explore why the real thing has been so earthquakeproof over the centuries none of the handson experiments are as revelatory as they want to be , but that only leads us to marvel at the structures all the more that s really what makes these amazing creations amazing they defy efforts to analyze them we 're not meant to understand how the great dome is supported , robert ousterhout , a university of pennsylvania professor , says of hagia sophia we see only the weightless quality of the building
pittsburgh there is a perception about the men s basketball program , and it is steeped in fact it is that , come march , come the ncaa tournament , the fighting irish cannot figure out how to win their last two trips ended in upset losses in the round of 64 , and they have not reached the round of 16 in 12 years this team , after winning the atlantic coast conference tournament last week , is different or so coach mike brey said and on thursday the irish avoided further ignominy by toppling pesky northeastern , 6965 , at consol energy center we could n't get away from them , brey said the irish \( 305 \) , seeded third in the midwest region , did not beat the no 14 huskies \( 2312 \) so much as outlast them northeastern , which trailed by 12 points with about six minutes left , countered every outburst with a run of its own , drawing as close as 6765 when scott eatherton put back a missed 3point attempt by david walker with 325 seconds remaining on notre dame s ensuing possession , pat connaughton threw a long pass down court to demetrius jackson , who saved the ball from going out of bounds but threw it into the hands of northeastern guard zach stahl the huskies did not have a timeout left , and eatherton said he wished they did , to draw up a play walker came around a curl looking for a 3pointer , but he was defended , and passed it off to quincy ford , who had the ball swiped away by jerian grant i 've watched the ncaa tournament , and crazy things happen , grant said so i just wanted to be able to make a play and try to get the ball northeastern then watched as zach auguste , who was fouled after grabbing the loose ball , made both free throws with 19 seconds left to provide the margin of victory notre dame will play no 6 butler on saturday in truth , brey had been wary of northeastern , making its first ncaa appearance since 1991 , as far back as november , when both teams appeared in the hall of fame tipoff tournament in uncasville , conn notre dame did not draw the huskies then , and brey told his players he was glad they had not this time , the irish did not have a choice northeastern stayed close the entire first half , when neither team led by more than 5 points to beat notre dame , huskies coach bill coen said , his team could not afford to make mistakes any you have to play the perfect game , he said the huskies did not play a perfect game their 16 turnovers offset their 3317 rebounding advantage , coen lamented but still nearly joined the ranks of iowa state and old dominion and winthrop , teams that in recent years drew the higherseeded irish in the round of 64 and vanquished them those defeats contributed to notre dame s reputation as a postseason patsy , a reputation that the irish expected to begin erasing during this tournament they ousted duke and north carolina in the conference tournament , but it was another victory by 7063 against miami in the acc quarterfinals that brey evoked in the locker room after thursday s game it was really hard , brey said let s see if we can get on a run like we did down there if notre dame does go on a run , it will need more complete performances from jackson , who had 8 points and 9 assists , and auguste , whose pickandroll proficiency flummoxed northeastern he scored 17 of his gamehigh 25 points after halftime , none more important than those that came on his two free throws those shots , auguste said , put notre dame in a place where we do n't have to worry too much the irish , at tournament time , are not that familiar with that place maybe another victory or two will acclimatize them
when did dance audiences last see and hear a composer perform his own works with the revelatory mastery shown by \? because the quadruple bill of his works thomas ad s concentric paths movements in music came over the weekend to new york city center , the mind flew to stravinsky it was at that same theater that stravinsky conducted the historic world premiere of his orpheus \( 1948 \) and other ballets of his mr ad s s music abounds in challenging constructions that make it \( as stravinsky s can still be \) hard on the unaccustomed ear in ad s s music , different parts of the orchestra often play in drastically dissimilar phrases and speeds his performing , however , has a communicative force that immediately renders his scores exciting , fascinating , persuasive , sensuous the ad s program an exceptional venture visited new york as part of the , from the sadler s wells theater in london , where it was performed in 2014 each of four ad s scores was accompanied by a dance by a different choreographer the title concentric paths is the subtitle of mr ad s s 2005 , which here is the score for wayne mcgregor s \( 2010 \) , originally made for \( that company s women danced it on point here it was danced by the mcgregor company , whose women do n't the difference , however , is unimportant \) even though i admired the violin concerto in those earlier city ballet performances , mr ad s s effect on friday he conducted the orchestra of st luke s , with thomas gould playing solo violin beautifully was transformative more romantic , more modernist , more intense that opened the program it was followed by karole armitage s \( 1999 \) \( set to mr ad s s cabaretstyle cantata of that name , which employs a 1955 poem by tennessee williams \) s \( using mr ad s s 2001 \) and finally , crystal pite s \( taking its name from mr ad s s 2010 music \) both the grit in the oyster and , new in 2014 , were sadler s wells commissions on friday , ms armitage , mr whitley and ms pite joined the dancers onstage after their respective works the program was a superb tribute to mr ad s s importance as a composer surely these four scores prove that far better than his opera the tempest \( 2004 \) , which is crippled by meredith oakes s foolish libretto yet do they suit dance \? my answer is a tentative yes they call , however , for choreographic musicality of a complexity far beyond anything shown in these four dances the audience gave ovations to polaris and ms pite anyone can see why beginning with a long sequence performed without music , this canadian choreographer used massed forces \( over 60 dancers , dressed in uniform black \) and geometric formations that suggested now spiders , now constellations we saw both running and interrupted running , with rushes suddenly stopping in place we saw sculptural group formations that changed sequentially , as if it were movement passing along rows of dominoes in some groupings the many performers presented their faces emphatically one way or another an expressionistic effect as if trying to read a sign in the sky or asking the audience a question another recurrent image was that of the arms aiming downward and vibrating , like quivering pincers this was strong if limited stuff \( the wave device was dreadfully overdone \) but , as the silent start led you to guess , it was seldom well coordinated with mr ad s s music this is intensely sensuous music its tranquil opening , for piano and harps , is ravishing in ways wholly at odds with ms pite s tense patterns later , with a brilliant obsessiveness that sometimes recalled beethoven , it developed urgent twonote patterns \( as had the piano quintet earlier in the evening \) the more you listened , the less you saw reflected in the choreography still , the pite dance was , relatively , the evening s choreographic highlight in life story , anna dennis \( soprano \) and mr ad s \( piano \) completely upstaged ms armitage s dull mockbalanchine pas de deux , which was danced none too impressively by ruka hatuasaar and emily wagner the dramatic suspense of ms dennis s diction \( calmly delivered over a very wide vocal span \) and the alert drama of mr ad s s playing became the sole events the grit in the oyster , mr whitley s politely tepid dance trio , was no match for the marvelous difficulty of mr ad s s writing in which piano and strings are often on vividly different wavelengths , and in which the four string instruments alone maintain a wonderful density of interplay beyond anything in these dances if only mr mcgregor were gifted at the choreographer s central task of sustaining movement for dancers , outlier would be an impressive piece of dance theater the various color schemes along the backdrop \( by mr mcgregor and lucy carter \) , lighting schemes \( by ms carter \) and the general format of who dances when with whom are smartly picturesque \( though seldom with any serious connection to the music s dynamics or texture \) a long quartet for one woman and three men changed its internal structure again and again this would have been impressive if only the dance consisted of much more than showy gimmickry the use of hyperextension and head isolations soon palled the random dancers , poor substitutes for the city ballet originals , seemed to be compensating with exaggeratedly balanchinetype mannerisms \( in particular , overflourished hands \) some of mr ad s s writing features a multiplicity of action that recalls some of the more intricate ensembles of merce cunningham i doubt that even the most sophisticated and musical of today s choreographers could equal it but i 'd certainly like to see them try music like this might shake the witty mark morris , for example , out of his penchant for excessive neatness there is a theatricality in mr ad s s music that calls for stage action in this program , that theatricality was only to be seen in the movements of the composer and his fellow musicians
serge hochar , who navigated chateau musar , his family s winery in , through 15 years of civil war as musar became one of the most admired wine producers in the world , died on wednesday in acapulco , mexico he was 75 he had been vacationing with his family and died while swimming in the ocean , said catherine miles , a vice president of , musar s american importer no cause was announced mr hochar \( pronounced hoshar \) oversaw production for musar , but he was more than a winemaker he was also an entrepreneur who crisscrossed six continents promoting his idiosyncratic , longlived wines as well as the ancient wine culture of lebanon , which had been moribund when his father , gaston , founded musar in 1930 musar s success helped build the modern lebanese wine industry when the civil war ended in 1990 , just five wineries were operating in lebanon by 2014 there were almost 50 , mr hochar said in an interview last spring beyond producing and selling wine , mr hochar , elegant and charismatic , was also something of a sage his aphoristic , mischievous , almost paradoxical insights on wine , food and life , delivered in any of five languages , turned conventional wisdom on its head and won him a devoted following in the wine trade i know nothing about wine , at a wine dinner in new york in 2012 , the sort of event where pronouncements are dispensed with an air of easy confidence and certainty i know how to make wine , but i know nothing about wine , and each day i discover that i know less at that same dinner , held to spotlight older vintages of musar , he reversed the customary order of service , providing the red wines with a meat course before the white wines with poultry once you taste the wines , you 'll understand why my white is my biggest red , he explained the musar wines , both red and white , were extraordinary , though decidedly not to everybody s taste the red resembled bordeaux in spirit , though it departed from the model in significant ways it was made not only of cabernet sauvignon , the major grape of red bordeaux , but also of and grapes from the south of france as a result , the wine could age and evolve for decades , like a good bordeaux , but it was spicy and rich with a distinctive funkiness that many critics labeled a flaw but devotees embraced as soulful the whites were , if possible , even more singular made from the ancient , indigenous lebanese grapes and , they were bigger and richer than the reds , with a complex , slightly honeyed flavor that seemed simultaneously sweet and dry opaque and impenetrable in their youth , they blossomed at 20 years or more of age the musar wines inspired a younger generation of natural winemakers , in part because of mr hochar s handsoff method of production they have proudly embraced characteristics like , or va deemed faults by critics who preferred squeaky clean wines wine is such a complex thing , and va is part of wine , mr hochar said if you have none , it s a flaw it s part of fermentation it s a question of balance life is harmony serge gaston hochar was born on nov 20 , 1939 , in beirut , lebanon , to a family of ancient french lineage that had arrived in lebanon during the crusades his father , gaston hochar , studied grapegrowing and winemaking in bordeaux and in 1930 planted his first grapes in the bekaa valley , an eastern region near the syrian border lebanon at the time was a largely christian country under french control , and the french army was a major early customer for musar s wine one young french officer , ronald barton , of the acclaimed bordeaux estates langoabarton and l ovillebarton , was stationed in lebanon and proved highly influential to musar as a young man , serge hochar studied engineering and then winemaking with the renowned enologist at the university of bordeaux years later , he said , he told mr peynaud , i make wine totally the opposite of the way you taught me in 1959 , he persuaded his father to step aside so that he could take over the winemaking duties at musar soon after , his brother , ronald \( who was named after mr barton \) , took charge of the commercial aspects of the winery back then , musar sold most of its wines in lebanon , but this began to change when civil war broke out in 1975 , effectively destroying the domestic market for wine by the time the war ended , the market for musar s wines was almost entirely international , built largely through mr hochar s efforts despite shells falling in vineyards and israeli tanks appearing at the winery , where the wine cellar doubled as a bomb shelter , musar missed only one vintage during the war , in 1976 , when electricity was out and roads were impassable , mr hochar said as the musar wines began to show up outside lebanon , the rest of the world took notice in 1979 , michael broadbent , a leading british wine critic and auctioneer , tasted musar at a wine fair in england and pronounced the '67 musar a great find in 1984 , decanter magazine , an influential british wine publication , named mr hochar its first man of the year , citing his dedication to producing fine wines despite the war wine is above politics , mr hochar said in 2012 wine is tolerance in recent years , mr hochar ceded the daytoday details of running the winery to his sons , gaston and marc , and to his nephew , ronald hochar s son ralph they and his brother survive him , as do mr hochar s wife , tania a daughter , karin three sisters and seven grandchildren even as he stepped back , mr hochar maintained a relentless travel schedule may 2012 , a typical month , began with a pilgrimage to lourdes , france after returning to beirut , he then departed to london for a wine fair before setting off for hong kong , south korea and china after returning again to lebanon on may 16 , he then visited turkey , paris , lebanon again , then brazil , all in an effort to explain lebanese wine and musar to understand lebanon is not easy , he said the dimension of taste in lebanon is different than anywhere else not better , but different better has no meaning

zurich swiss authorities conducted an extraordinary earlymorning operation here wednesday to arrest several top soccer officials and extradite them to the united states on federal corruption charges as leaders of fifa , soccer s global governing body , gathered for their annual meeting , more than a dozen plainclothed swiss law enforcement officials arrived unannounced at the baur au lac hotel , an elegant fivestar property with views of the alps and lake zurich they went to the front desk to get keys and proceeded upstairs to the rooms the arrests were carried out peacefully one fifa official , eduardo li of costa rica , was led by the authorities from his room to a sidedoor exit of the hotel he was allowed to bring his luggage , which was adorned with fifa logos the charges , backed by an fbi investigation , allege widespread corruption in fifa over the past two decades , involving bids for world cups as well as marketing and broadcast deals , according to three law enforcement officials with direct knowledge of the case the indictment names 14 people on charges including racketeering , wire fraud and money laundering conspiracy in addition to senior soccer officials , the indictment is also expected to name sportsmarketing executives from the united states and south america who are accused of paying more than 150 million in bribes and kickbacks in exchange for media deals associated with major soccer tournaments , according to one government official briefed on the matter the law enforcement official said the soccer officials charged are jeffrey webb , eugenio figueredo , jack warner , eduardo li , julio rocha , costas takkas , rafael esquivel , jos maria marin and nicol s leoz charges were also expected against the sportsmarketing executives alejandro burzaco , aaron davidson , hugo jinkis and mariano jinkis authorities also charged jos margulies as an intermediary who facilitated illegal payments we 're struck by just how long this went on for and how it touched nearly every part of what fifa did , said a law enforcement official it just seemed to permeate every element of the federation and was just their way of doing business it seems like this corruption was institutionalized the justice department , the fbi and fifa did not have any immediate comment the arrests were a startling blow to fifa , a multibilliondollar organization that governs the world s most popular sport but has been plagued by accusations of bribery for decades the inquiry is also a major threat to sepp blatter , fifa s longtime president who is generally recognized as the most powerful person in sports , though he was not charged he has for years acted as a de facto head of state politicians , star players , national soccer officials and global corporations that want their brands attached to the sport have long genuflected before him an election , seemingly preordained to give mr blatter a fifth term as president , is scheduled for friday the case is the most significant yet for united states attorney general loretta e lynch , who took office last month she previously served as the united states attorney in brooklyn , where she supervised the fifa investigation ms lynch and fbi director james comey were expected to hold a news conference on wednesday morning in new york with more than 15 billion in reserves , fifa is as much a global financial conglomerate as a sports organization with countries around the world competing aggressively to win the bid to host the world cup , mr blatter has commanded the fealty of anyone who wanted a piece of that revenue stream he and fifa have weathered corruption controversies in the past , but none involved charges of federal crimes in united states court united states law gives the justice department wide authority to bring cases against foreign nationals living abroad , an authority that prosecutors have used repeatedly in international terrorism cases those cases can hinge on the slightest connection to the united states , like the use of an american bank or internet service provider s treaty with the united states is unusual in that it gives swiss authorities the power to refuse extradition for tax crimes , but on matters of general criminal law , the swiss have agreed to turn people over for prosecution in american courts critics of fifa point to the lack of transparency regarding executive salaries and resource allocations for an organization that , by its own admission , had revenue of 57 billion from 2011 to 2014 policy decisions are also often taken without debate or explanation , and a small group of officials known as the executive committee operates with outsize power fifa has for years functioned with little oversight and even less transparency alexandra wrage , a governance consultant who once unsuccessfully attempted to help overhaul fifa s methods , famously labeled the organization byzantine and impenetrable law enforcement officials said much of the inquiry involves concacaf , one of the six regional confederations that compose fifa concacaf which stands for confederation of north , central america and caribbean association football includes major countries like the united states and mexico , and also tiny ones like barbados and montserrat according to the indictment , several international soccer events were tainted by bribes and kickbacks involving media and marketing rights world cup qualifiers in the concacaf region the gold cup the concacaf champions league the copa am rica and the copa libertadores the indictment also claims that bribes and kickbacks were found in connection with the selection of the host country for the 2010 world cup concacaf was led from 1990 to 2011 by mr warner , the longtime head of trinidad tobago s federation a key powerbroker in fifa s governing executive committee , mr warner had been dogged by accusations of corruption he was accused of illegally profiting from the resale of tickets to the 2006 world cup , and of withholding the bonuses of the trinidad players who participated in that tournament mr warner resigned his positions in fifa , concacaf and his national association in 2011 amid mounting evidence that he had been part of an attempt to buy the votes of caribbean federation officials in the 2010 fifa presidential election a also found that he had received tens of millions of dollars in misappropriated funds but according to the rules of fifa at the time , mr warner s resignation led to the immediate closure of all ethics committee cases against him the presumption of innocence is maintained , fifa said in a short statement announcing his departure
investigators have identified a person of interest in the 1989 abduction of a boy in minnesota , a possible break in a case that became a national symbol of child kidnapping and abuse , law enforcement officials said thursday the man , daniel j heinrich , 52 , was charged thursday in federal district court in st paul with receipt and possession of an extensive trove of child pornography he has not been charged in the disappearance of the boy , jacob e wetterling , who was 11 when he was by a gunwielding man 26 years ago near his home in st joseph , minn we consider him to be a person of interest in the wetterling abduction , said richard t thornton , the agent in charge of the fbi s minneapolis office andrew m luger , the united states attorney for minnesota , cautioned that mr heinrich , who was arrested wednesday night , has denied any involvement in the disappearance of jacob wetterling and is not charged at this time with any crime related to that disappearance jacob , his brother and a friend were riding bikes near the wetterling family s home on oct 22 , 1989 , when a masked man stepped from a driveway with a gun , told the other two boys to leave and took jacob an intensive manhunt followed , drawing widespread news coverage , and though the boy was never found , he for the cause of missing and exploited children his parents became wellknown activists in that cause created a foundation , jacob s hope , to aid in the search for missing children and gave for years that they had not given up on finding their son law enforcement officials said thursday that they had met privately with the wetterlings , who released a statement saying they were not ready to comment on the developments investigators decided last year to conduct an updated , full coldcase review of jacob s disappearance and a string of unsolved sexual assaults in central minnesota in the late 1980s that were believed to be related , mr thornton said using technology that was not available at the time , he said , investigators tested clothes that had been collected as evidence in one of the assaults , against another boy in january 1989 in cold spring , minn , and found mr heinrich s dna mr heinrich could not be charged in the cold spring assault because the statute of limitations had expired , but the new evidence served as the basis for a warrant to search his house in annandale , minn , on july 28 in that search , investigators discovered 19 threering binders filled with images of children , including images of naked prepubescent boys , said andrew m luger , the united states attorney for minnesota none of the pictures were of jacob , officials said , but many of them were of children known to have been victims of child pornography investigators also found videotapes of boys engaged in routine public activities like riding bicycles and playing in parks the stearns county sheriff , john l sanner , said the images and videos spanned more than a decade in investigating the wetterling case , mr heinrich was looked at very closely back in 1989 and 1990 , sheriff sanner said court documents made public this week show that tire tread marks and footprints found shortly after the abduction indicated that mr heinrich might have been there , but officials said thursday that those marks were far from definitive they would not say what evidence now led them to link mr heinrich publicly to the case
washington gov of louisiana , a onetime rising republican star whose popularity has plummeted in his own state , dropped out of the presidential race on tuesday , conceding that he was unable to find any traction i 've come to the realization this is not my time , he said on fox news mr jindal had unveiled a series of policy proposals , and spent considerable time courting conservatives in iowa , which begins the presidential nominating process none of it worked he raised little money , did not rise high enough in the polls to appear on the primetime debate stage and was overshadowed by unconventional candidates such as mr trump and ben carson we spent a lot of time developing detailed policy papers , and given this crazy , unpredictable election season , clearly there just was n't a lot of interest in those policy papers , mr jindal said in an interview on fox news tuesday night his more immediate challenge was most likely money he had just 261 , 000 on hand as of the start of october mr jindal withdrew days before a runoff election in the louisiana governor s race , a contest in which the candidates in both parties have intermittently criticized the oncepopular incumbent mr jindal , 44 , a son of indian immigrants , was first elected governor in 2007 , two years after devastated new orleans , and he initially enjoyed great popularity but he fell out of favor in a second term characterized by fiscal crises and frequent outofstate travels seventy percent of louisianans disapprove of his job performance , according to a university of new orleans poll taken this month his soaring unpopularity at home and difficulty drawing even cursory notice in the presidential race was a striking turnabout for mr jindal , a rhodes scholar who became his state s secretary of health at 24 and who oversaw its system of public universities by 28 mr jindal , who effectively began his presidential bid by declaring republicans the stupid party in the wake of the 2012 election , tried to win attention to his longshot white house campaign with a number of gambits he placed a hidden camera in a tree outside the governor s mansion to record a family meeting in which he first informed his children he was running for president and released the video to the news media he also frequently seized on the news of the day , churning out opinion essays but even when he was at his most provocative faulting the father of the man accused of the september massacre at a oregon community college , for example he was unable to translate his penchant for pushing the envelope into support in the statement announcing his departure , mr jindal indicated he would return to focusing on policy issues one of the things i will do is go back to work at the think tank i started a few years ago where i will be outlining a blueprint for making this the american century , he said mr jindal is the third candidate in the now 14member to drop out of race rick perry , the former texas governor , and gov scott walker of wisconsin also ended their campaigns
san francisco when audiences watch the movie spare parts in theaters this month , they will see the kind of hollywood ending that has eluded the immigration debate in congress the film is based on my reporting about four young immigrants who built an underwater robot in the movie , which closely reflects the true story , the students enter the nation s preeminent robotics competition , an event sponsored by nasa and the navy they win widespread recognition for their accomplishments and , when the movie ends in 2004 , their future is bright unfortunately , that s not how the story really ends all four students were born in mexico and were brought across the border illegally as children though they grew up in arizona and viewed themselves as americans , the law did not they lived with the daily threat of deportation oscar vazquez dreamed of joining the army he was officer of the year in his jrotc program but discovered he could n't enlist because he did n't have legal residency cristian arcega was a geeky brainiac who found few outlets for his smarts in gangtorn west phoenix lorenzo santillan was a former gang member himself looking to stay clean and luis aranda , the only one who had gotten a work permit , just the year before , was a hulking giant of a kid who rarely spoke this ragtag group from carl hayden community high school in west phoenix constructed the robot out of cheap plastic tubing and garbage it smelled so bad , they called the machine stinky the other entrants almost all college students had corporate sponsors and serious budgets this was an underwater robotics contest , but carl hayden did n't even have a swimming pool nonetheless , stinky came in first place after the event , lower ranked contestants went on to rewarding jobs at tech companies and research institutes meanwhile , the carl hayden students struggled to afford tuition for college lorenzo santillan considered becoming a mechanical engineer , but instead earned a cheaper associate degree in cooking today he works as a line cook luis aranda studied cooking as well but did not complete a degree and now works as a janitor cristian arcega , the most technically skilled member of the team , made it to arizona state university on a scholarship but in 2006 , during his freshman year , arizona voters passed proposition 300 , an antiimmigrant measure that prohibits undocumented students from receiving any state financial aid or qualifying for instate tuition more than tripling his tuition he dropped out and is now unemployed he is trying to enough money to return to school full time oscar vazquez s story is the most dramatic he also had a scholarship to asu , and after working menial jobs for a year , was able to attend he was a sophomore when proposition 300 passed , and managed to stay in school only by piecing together more scholarships , all while leading the university s robotics team to regional championships he graduated with a degree in mechanical engineering in 2009 and applied for legal residency not only was his application denied , but he was also summarily banned from the united states for 10 years for living here without a visa he ended up working on an assembly line in mexico after a year , his ban was reversed when senator richard j durbin , democrat of illinois , interceded on his behalf mr vazquez returned , enlisted in the army , and served a tour of combat duty in afghanistan he is finally a citizen , and repairs trains in montana for the railroad company bnsf deferred action for childhood arrivals , the program created by president obama s executive order that shields some undocumented students and young adults from deportation , did n't go into effect until 2012 had it been in place when the carl hayden students were in high school , allowing them to legally work , their lives might have turned out very differently they have surmounted enormous odds , but none were able to professionally pursue their passion for robotics it is a startling rebuke to the american dream house republicans seem to view this as a fitting outcome this week , john a boehner , the speaker of the house , that would roll back the president s order if he is successful , talented young people like mr santillan and mr arcega could be deported at any moment after a while you get used to disappointment , mr arcega said to me this week i try not to have high expectations anymore those who oppose granting residency to these immigrants argue that it would deny resources to existing residents and citizens but we 've already invested in these students all through elementary and high school why not continue and get a return on that investment \? there is rising demand for the talent these students possess we grant roughly 85 , 000 h1b visas , for immigrants with special skills , to engineers to fill jobs here in doing so , we overlook a generation of students who are deemed foreigners but who grew up here and plan to stay when their visas expire , a majority of h1b visa holders will leave , and take the skills they developed with them at a time when science and technology prowess will be critical to this country s growth , we ca n't afford to squander the homegrown brainpower of students like oscar , lorenzo , luis and cristian
houston if there were slumping shoulders and sagging hopes when the returned to the dugout at the end of the seventh inning trailing by four runs , mike moustakas made sure they did not stay that way for long moustakas , the royals' third baseman , occasionally ornery and often intense , had plenty to be cranky about backtoback home runs by the , which had followed an overturned call that shortcircuited their own rally , conspiring to leave the royals down to their final six outs of the season so moustakas had a message for his team i'm not ready to go home it s just that we 're not losing this game , said moustakas , whose words to his teammates carried a few expletives we 've worked too hard , and we 've come too far whether the sermon by moustakas served as inspiration , it clearly captured the royals' mood monday after a stunning , offthemat 96 victory that sent this american league division series back to kansas city for a deciding game 5 on wednesday there seemed to be little chance of that happening after the bottom of the seventh , when the astros' carlos correa , the precocious rookie shortstop , hit his second home run of the game , a tworun blast , and colby rasmus followed with a solo homer , his fourth of the postseason the home runs gave the astros a 62 lead and sent the capacity crowd at minute maid park into a frenzy but if there was anything to be gleaned from last year s playoffs , it may have been this never count the royals out they won five games in their final atbat during last year s run , none more memorable than the wildcard playoff when kansas city trailed oakland , 73 , but scored three runs in the eighth and one in the ninth to send the game to extra innings after the athletics took a lead in the 12th , the royals scored two more runs to win it after that , anything can happen , said catcher salvador perez , whose tworun homer in the second had been the royals' only runs until the eighth we 've got something in the back of our heads it s not hard to believe still , it was not hard for doubt to creep in correa , who hit his first home run in the third to tie the score , had given the astros a 32 lead in the fifth , when he ripped a double to right that allowed george springer to sprint home from first base when the ball whistled past eric hosmer , a twotime gold glove first baseman , it appeared to be a sign that things had turned against the royals this october a year ago , their thrilling wildcard playoff was a springboard for a run that ended agonizingly close to a world series title and revitalized kansas city s interest in baseball the royals were a throwback to '80s baseball relentless on the basepaths , spectacular defensively and ready to swing at anything and everything this season they backed up that run by racing to the best record in the league but in this series , their playoff magic had begun to look ephemeral no more so than in the seventh , when the pinchrunning specialist terrance gore stole second and , with two outs , took off for third gore arrived comfortably ahead of catcher jason castro s throw but the astros challenged the play , believing gore s foot had come off the bag for an instant after a 2minute20second review , gore was ruled out it was the first time in 13 career attempts he had been thrown out when they came to bat in the eighth , the royals searched for their momentum one pitch at a time everybody got fired up in the dugout , like this is going to be the toughest six outs they 're ever going to get , said jarrod dyson , who entered as a pinchrunner that s the mentality that we took out there , and big things happened for us alex rios singled to left alcides escobar grounded a single up the middle ben zobrist laced a single to center to load the bases lorenzo cain , the frustration of four strikeouts in his previous six atbats evident in the way he carried himself , grounded a single to left that made the score 63 astros manager a j hinch lifted the righthander will harris for the lefthander tony sipp to face hosmer , who at that point in the series had one hit but hosmer singled to right , cutting the royals' deficit to 64 the astros appeared as if they might escape , but kendrys morales s grounder up the middle kicked off the leg of sipp and under the glove of correa instead of a doubleplay ball , zobrist and cain scored , and the game was tied , 66 in came closer luke gregerson , and after moustakas struck out , the backup catcher drew butera worked a 10pitch walk alex gordon followed with a groundout to the right side to put the royals ahead , 76 the royals saw 57 pitches in the inning the mindset from the entire team was just make this atbat count , said hosmer , who provided a cushion with a tworun homer in the ninth as invigorating as the victory was for the royals , it was crushing for the astros , who were on the brink of the championship series , a year after they broke a string of three consecutive 100loss seasons the loss will be especially hard for correa , whose error overshadowed a dynamic day at the plate as the astros packed up their belongings and prepared to head to kansas city , they were also searching for hope to carry with them we went from pretty high , feeling pretty good about it , and then , said castro , his voice trailing off it s not what we were expecting , but that s part of baseball you never know anything can happen especially , it seems , when the royals are involved
greenburgh , ny on the afternoon of may 19 , , the president of the , met with steve mills , his general manager , at the team s practice complex here mills had a couple of hours before he was expected to report to a midtown manhattan hotel , where he would represent the team at the nba s annual draft lottery as they discussed their usual daily business everything from the playoffs to potential prospects in the draft jackson kept folding a piece of paper until it formed a neat , tiny square he finally presented it to mills , who opened it to reveal a series of numbers , which mills presumed were the team s odds for landing various picks in the lottery but they were the wrong odds , mills said they were the odds from a different year the message from jackson was essentially that the numbers did not matter , that everything that would happen at the lottery was beyond their control the team would move forward regardless or at least that was what mills thought jackson meant phil s not just cryptic on twitter , mills said he s cryptic with me , too , sometimes the odds did not fall in the ' favor , of course after finishing with the secondworst record in the league \( and enduring the worst season in franchise history \) , , which is scheduled for thursday at barclays center in recent weeks , jackson and mills , along with coach derek fisher and the rest of the team s front office , have been preparing for the draft on thursday , four post players frank kaminsky of wisconsin , trey lyles of kentucky , joshua smith of georgetown and kevon looney of ucla worked out for team officials at the practice complex jackson said he had originally planned to work out only 12 to 15 prospects , back when the knicks had the best odds of securing one of the top two picks in the draft but that pool has since expanded to upward of 30 players whether the knicks keep the fourth pick or trade it , the draft will offer them an opportunity to begin to reshape their roster before the onset of free agency i have a definite idea about how i want a team to look and what kind of skills the players need to have , said jackson , who remains as wedded as ever to the triangle offense when everybody else says , well , this might be their best pick , ' we 're not going that way at all we 're going with what we feel will be the best player for us at this particular time a week before the draft , jackson and mills agreed to an interview that touched on their preparation for the draft , their approach to free agency their thoughts on the nba finals between the cleveland cavaliers and the golden state warriors and the decision to let play in the nba allstar game , only for him to have knee surgery days later jackson also addressed the reintroduction of isiah thomas to madison square garden after thomas was involved in a sexual harassment suit during his days as president and then coach of the knicks , as well as jackson s use of the word goink this interview has been edited and condensed well , steve went there and just messed it up actually , jamie mathews did he was with the balls back there we just knew it was a lottery shot , and this was one of those things that we were joking about today picking at no 4 changed up how we 're going to deal with it so it s been an adjustment but we 're enjoying the process , and that s the fun thing i think if you get a high position , you 're kind of locked in you try to stay openminded , but there s so much pressure about who s slotted to go where and how all the pundits think the picks are supposed to fall now , we have an open field and we 're really exploring all our possibilities so whereas before i was like , ok , we 're going to draft a big , now we have to be open to what s there for us that makes our team different so that changes up our look now and our look next week when we go into the freeagent chase so we 've had to do a lot more work i see steve as the future of this franchise i mean , i'm here for a time , and i'm trying to help turn it around the best way i can but i can see steve having a lasting tenure here , and this is one of the things that s good about our relationship , that we can grow from our teamwork i could n't believe that there was some kind of hue and cry over whether i should have been there to watch what in effect had taken place in a back room , where they had some balls rolling around in a hamster cage so i volunteered to do it and phil said , well , you know , we can have derek do it and i said no , derek s suffered enough i 'll go steve does most of the communications with other teams there are a lot of teams that call , but you do n't get that many calls from teams who are picking from , let s just say , 15 to 30 everybody who is in that range wants to know , would you be willing to move down for x , y and z \? so we 're diligent in trying to be open to thinking about whether there s a combination of a good player plus a move down that we think rounds out our roster and puts us in a better position to build this team and move it forward at the same time , we understand that we 're going to get a really good player that can be a part of where we 're going long term at no 4 yeah , we have no big men so we 're seeing what can we add to our team that will move us along and make us a better team , and we 'll have to fill out that big possibility with some free agents if we end up going smaller with wings and guards in the draft but there s some good players this is a draft that everybody feels like , in the lottery , from 1 through 14 , there s really good players , and a lot of good players that will be there in the later part of the first round , too history tells us that 1 through 10 usually indicates that you 're going to get a starter at some level we obviously can see holes in our roster but one of the positives that came out of last season was that when we did our exit meetings , there was n't one single guy who played on the team last year that does n't want to be back so we felt that was progress and that things were moving in the right direction after we made the trades that we made it felt like a second season we were moving forward , and they all want to be part of it so now our job is looking at , ok , what s going to happen in the draft \? what do we think we can do in free agency \? and then looking at the guys who were a part of what we did last year which of those guys can fill roles or help continue to move this thing forward and not have a wholesale change where we have to introduce nine new guys to our roster \? we have guys that all played together they know how to use the system , so that 'll help us when we saw that the season was not going to be successful , that our chances of making the playoffs were gone , we had to create what we could create and do the right thing , which was get players who wanted to go places for the playoffs , like pablo prigioni and amar'e stoudemire and so forth , their opportunities in the process , we had to try to keep our coaching staff and our players understanding of what we were looking for i do n't think the offensive system has to take a back seat to anything we do we 're looking for people who want to play a full basketball game , that want to be able to make plays , that want to be able to do things that are a credit to their skills i think people that want to play the full game have seen that demonstrated , and if they 're interested in doing that , they know that this system can feature what they can do and we have people who are interested so we feel good about that we 're fortunate that we had a group of young players who really enjoyed being here they understand what it s like to play in new york and what it s like to play in the garden when guys are thinking about where they 're going in free agency , they want to play with an elite player , and we have that in carmelo we have a group of role players around him who all had a good experience so when they 're out talking to players about what it s like to be with phil here and what it s like to play with fish as the coach and what it s like to play with carmelo , we 're confident that all those conversations are positive and then we have the benefit of carmelo having gone through free agency and the recruitment process last summer so he sits down with me a lot and talks to phil and talks about what was important in his journey and what was n't important so it gives us an opportunity to have him involved in the process we know there are a limited number of guys we can bring in this year we think we 'll get competitive guys to play i think we 'll complement the guys we have here , and we 're going to move forward we do know we 're going to have big guys in that group we 're going to have to search out some big men players who are resistant to it should n't be here guys who want to play basketball and feel comfortable with their skills should understand that there is ample opportunity to play a game that s an evolved game it s a thinking man s game it s a logical game if phil says we need to get a big guy , well , we just sat in a film session with four big guys who watched the way a big guy operates in the triangle , and i think it s a lot more attractive than a lot of the basketball that they 'll see other teams play we 're trying to find players who are the best fit for us we 're really chasing as much information as we can we 're not interested in guys who are just interested in the money and in their branding they have to have a little more to their life than just those selfish desires there s nothing wrong with chasing money , and there s nothing wrong with making the most from your name but that seems to be the running theme that you see a lot these days i do n't see any value at all in an allstar game none i think it was a pretty exciting game this year because of its speed but as a coach , what s the point \? but when guys have , as part of their contract , shoe things when they make the allstar team , we try to accommodate what will help them move forward with their lives and their careers so when we sat down with carmelo in london and we had dinner with him , we actually pointed to that date as a possible time for him to shut it down if he was going to have the full ability to have an operation , go through rehab and training , and get ready for next season , that was an appropriate time because it gave him march , april , may , june , july , etc , and he was going to need at least six months so we actually did plan that date we did n't plan the exact date , but we said , you want to play in the allstar game , do n't you \? and he said , yeah , i want to play i said well , that s a date we could work with so let s go from there to put it all in context , carmelo was playing with an injury that was n't going to get worse there was no risk to him playing , but it takes a certain amount of time to get it done so we needed to pick a time when he could get it done and i ca n't speak for carmelo , but i think he felt like he had an obligation as the face of the new york knicks with the allstar game at madison square garden i should be here and play in the allstar game it was n't a risk the idea of whether it was the right thing to do , how do you think he played that night \? i think he got between the free throw line and the other free throw line i do n't think he could run very well we 're really pleased everything s going along swimmingly , as they would say swimmingly without a doubt i knew it was going to be a challenge we just did n't have any room to work last year we knew that we were going to have to make big changes with the limitations that we had , being in a lockedin situation as far as the salary cap goes that s why when i said recently that i did n't know why i was n't given some votes for executive of the year , i was n't kidding i was really serious we had a yeoman s job of having to get rid of a lot of fat on our roster to get to where we are i saw mitch kupchak got a vote , so i know some people valued what the lakers were doing obviously yeah , isiah came in my office i was on the phone , but i was able to shake his hand and there have been a number of times when we 've just bumped into each other here in the cafeteria we talked about the playoffs , about his team he seems to be happy doing his job , and that s about it jim dolan had talked to us about it over dinner , maybe a month before it happened we said , are you cognizant of the fact that this at least has the look of putting the fox in the henhouse \? is that a good term \? in reviewing the history of it , we were told what the approach was by the garden and how it went down jim said , if you have any suggestions that you want to come back with , i'm open and not being in that field , i did n't have any information it s not where my head is at so we 're not giving them any advice , and it s going both ways i 've gotten comments from people who thought it was a really great series because it was so close and oneonone ball , street ball so it was just complete opposites personally , i think cleveland had to do what they did to manufacture the games to be as close as they got them it was a great demonstration of perseverance by lebron james , trying to keep the games close and trying to do the best he could for golden state , it was pretty exciting for that town and for that team there s an awful lot of pressure for a team to come into the finals without any finals experience in the first couple of games , they looked like they did n't quite know how to compete at that level , with the necessary intensity and physicality the games just got more physical , and they adjusted they have all these analysts i just wanted to see someone come back to me with statistics is 3point shooting in the playoffs as consistent as it is in the regular season \? does your 3pointshooting percentage change because you 're in the playoffs \? no one figured that one out and that s probably me being obtuse to leave it open at the end but goink is one of those new york expressions that we use , and i will tell you this i learned something someone sent me the fact that if you look it up on urban dictionary , you 'll find out what it means in today s society well , it s rather bizarre to say the least goink is a castoff expression , right \? instead of , how s it going \? it s how s it goink \? it turned out to be either a combination of a mixed ethnic group part korean , part chinese or it s a vernacular term for how do you deal with a sexual partner no , i had no idea do we expect to make the finals next year \? it did not look good when i saw i think we were 80 to 1 philly was 200 to 1 , so i think they 're being generous well , i'm gimping around and i'm doing ok but we may have to travel to deal with the free agent market and be on the move it may require making appeals and presentations so we 're prepared to do that both steve and i , as well as derek we 're prepared to do all we can do to appeal to our choices i do n't know what we 're going to do now we were watching the finals and hockey he walks his dogs i walk my dogs
los angeles citing an alarming rise in shootings by police over the last year , the civilian board that oversees the los angeles police called on tuesday for an extensive review of the department s policies on the use of force the new president of the los angeles police commission , matt johnson , said reducing officers' use of force was one of his top priorities for the department , on par with bringing down the overall crime rate the number of shootings by the police so far this year has nearly doubled , to 45 from 23 during the same period last year , mr johnson said he added that , like other departments , the los angeles police were facing a crisis of confidence with minority communities , particularly africanamericans , in the wake of police shootings of black civilians across the country we must fully commit to minimizing the number of useofforce incidents , mr johnson said in addition to review of useof force incidents , he called for an examination , and possible expansion , of nonlethal options like tasers and beanbag shotguns the los angeles police spent more than a decade under a federal consent decree after dozens of officers were accused of corruption and evidence tampering from 2001 until 2013 , the federal government imposed reforms on the police here , which helped the that had often been checkered with officer abuse of the public it has come to be regarded by many authorities as a leader in community policing mr johnson s comments on tuesday acknowledged problems that police had faced recently , after years of falling crime rates and praise from the law enforcement community homicides , violent crime and property crime have all increased by at least 10 percent so far in 2015 compared with last year august was the deadliest month since 2007 , with 39 homicides , mr johnson said it s concerning to me , steve soboroff , another member of the police commission , said of the rising crime numbers the job of being a police officer is changing dramatically , with all these modifications in training , dealing with the mentally ill , use of force but he said 20 to 30 factors were contributing to the rising crime rate , such as changing state laws that have let many minor drug offenders stay out of prison i do n't attribute it to something wrong with the police department , he said the los angeles police chief , charlie beck , and the department did not comment on the commission s action tuesday police departments across the country are facing increased scrutiny of their use of force just tuesday , southern california public radio , a local radio station , detailing nearly 400 police shootings in los angeles in recent years , none of which have been prosecuted as homicides if there s one major department that has transformed itself in the last 10 years , it s the los angeles police department , said chuck wexler , the executive director of the police executive research forum but every police department in the country is under increased scrutiny because of what we 've seen in the last year they have to continue to make progress and look for ways to deescalate to maintain their leadership position connie rice , a civil rights lawyer who has worked to help carry out reforms at the los angeles police department over the last decade , said it was encouraging that police officials were looking at the complication question of how to deal with use of force right now , police have a downtothebone belief that they have to watch suspects' hands , and if the hands move , they can shoot , ms rice said we are going to have to work this through with them , and show them why that is n't so in an interview after his remarks on tuesday , mr johnson said he took his position on the police commission as a direct response to the national conversation that s going on regarding police use of force part one is greater transparency , he said that will include not only greater analysis of useofforce data , but also body cameras , which will soon be standard for all los angeles police officers but this is a first step , not an end in itself , mr johnson said this will hopefully give us the tools needed to continue significant reform

pitcher to bring his cellphone to the game schoenrock had told the righthander stephen gostkowski to take the day off gostkowski s family members were in town , and sunday was looking to be an eventful day for them gostkowski would have none of it there was a doubleheader against visiting mississippi valley state and he wanted to be there , even if he was not going to pitch during the tigers' doubleheader sweep , gostkowski s cellphone rang and he went outside the dugout to take the call he returned a few minutes later he was as white as a ghost , schoenrock recalled this week in a phone interview he said , i just talked to bill belichick the took me in the fourth round' they had indeed at no 118 over all one of two placekickers selected in the 2006 nfl draft the other was virginia s kurt smith , who went to san diego in the sixth round smith s next kick in the nfl will be his first , while gostkowski is still with the patriots he is the franchise s career leading

was given a baseball scholarship but won the kicking job as a freshman he was a very average kicker in high school with a strong leg who did n't always know where the ball was going , said tommy west , his football coach at memphis but you still saw something there and he was a determined kid over four years , gostkowski made 70 of 92 fieldgoal attempts and 159 of 165 extra points he showed his versatility by recovering his own onside kick and his foresight by using an nflsize tee on kickoffs he left memphis as the 13th most productive scorer in ncaa division ia history schoenrock thought football was gostkowski s best bet for the future nonetheless , baseball scouts had inquired about gostkowski , impressed by his ability to throw hard sliders in the 90mileperhour range and apparently undeterred by his career record of 722 with a 604 era it was harder for me with baseball , gostkowski said i did n't do it year round because of football , he missed the fall workouts with the baseball team in the spring , during the baseball season , schoenrock had his pitching coach bring a bag of footballs to practice the patriots were among a handful of teams that worked him out at the liberty bowl they were about to part ways with adam vinatieri , their kicker since 1996 i had no idea what was happening , gostkowski said they do n't give you any inclination i thought i did pretty well i did n't do the combine i went to the senior bowl i pitched my last game a week before the draft i was in my own world he is still very much in his world , one in which he has surpassed vinatieri , a likely hall of famer , as the patriots' scoring leader his accuracy is astounding he has converted an nfl record 432 consecutive extra points since his only miss , during his rookie season he has made more than 87 percent of his fieldgoal attempts , including all 12 this season among them is a careerbest 57yarder not only is he the leading scorer in franchise history , he is no 2 in continuous service behind tom brady and , at 31 , second in age to brady a case could be made that not only are they the two oldest players on the patriots , they are also the two most secure belichick has not even bothered to bring in a kicker during training camp to push gostkowski one of the things new england asked him when they worked him out was whether he could take tough coaching , west said you know , sometimes you do n't want to be too hard on kickers because they can go into a shell with stephen , the more you got in his face , the madder he got and the madder he got , the better he kicked gostkowski said i'm proud that i 've been able to stick around in an environment where the media is tough , the fans are tough , the weather is tough and the coaches are tough when you 're on a good team , you just want to do your part and know that they trust you that trust is implicit now but in super bowl xlii against the giants , during gostkowski s second season , belichick chose to go for a first down on fourthand13 at the giants' 31yard line midway through the third quarter the patriots lost the ball on downs the giants won , 1714 since then gostkowski has become as omnipresent as a kicker can be he has led the nfl in scoring four times , including the last three seasons steve has been tremendous , said josh mcdaniels , new england s offensive coordinator we know what we need to do offensively to give him an opportunity , and we certainly trust him to go out there and make it he s done that numerous times gostkowski said as kickers , we do n't make our own opportunities we take advantage of the ones we get i do n't try to overthink it i try to go out and make every kick i can and if i miss , i 'll try to make the next one chances are he will get more opportunities sunday against the jets , and the numbers indicate he probably will not miss by now , the routine , and the result , has almost become automatic
washington tashfeen malik , who with her husband carried out the massacre in san bernardino , calif , passed three background checks by american immigration officials as she moved to the united states from pakistan none uncovered what ms malik had said online about her views on violent jihad she said she supported it and she said she wanted to be a part of it american law enforcement officials said they recently discovered those old and previously unreported communications as they pieced together the lives of ms malik and her husband , syed rizwan farook , trying to understand how they pulled off the deadliest terrorist attack on american soil since sept 11 , 2001 had the authorities found the messages years ago , they might have kept her out of the country but their recent discovery exposed a significant and perhaps inevitable shortcoming in how foreigners are screened when they enter the united states , particularly as people everywhere talk more and disclose more about themselves online despite a tremendous electronic intelligencegathering apparatus that captures phone calls and emails from around the world , it remains impossible to conduct an exhaustive investigation for each of the tens of millions of people who are cleared each year to come to this country to work , visit or live federal officials said they had discovered private conversations about jihad between ms malik and mr farook on an online messaging platform , as well as emails and communications on a dating site , but not on traditional social media sites such as facebook but even those sites , where conversations can be public or semipublic , pose a logistical hurdle for immigration screeners , who do not routinely conduct social media searches during the visa process in the aftermath of terrorist attacks in san bernardino and paris , this screening process has been singled out as a major vulnerability in the nation s defense against terrorism lawmakers from both parties have endorsed making it harder for people to enter the united states if they have recently been in iraq or syria donald j trump , the republican presidential candidate , has said there should be a temporary ban on muslims' entering the country while president obama has cautioned against a betrayal of our values in the way the united states responds to threats , he has ordered a review of the k1 visa program , which allows foreigners like ms malik to move to the united states to marry americans , putting them on a pathway to permanent residence and , ultimately , citizenship the obama administration is trying to determine whether those background checks can be expanded without causing major delays in the popular program in an attempt to ensure they did not miss threats from men and women who entered the country the same way ms malik did , immigration officials are also reviewing all of about 90 , 000 k1 visas issued in the past two years and are considering a moratorium on new ones while they determine whether changes should be made somebody entered the united states through the k1 visa program and proceeded to carry out an act of terrorism on american soil , the white house spokesman , josh earnest , said on thursday that program is at a minimum worth a very close look in an era when technology has given intelligence agencies seemingly limitless ability to collect information on people , it may seem surprising that anyone s facebook or twitter post could go unnoticed in a background screening but the screenings are an example of the tradeoffs that security officials make as they try to mitigate the threat of terrorism while keeping borders open for business and travel we run people against watch lists and that s how we decided if they get extra screening , said c stewart verdery jr , a senior homeland security official during george w bush s administration in cases where those lists do n't hit , there s nothing that distinguishes them from people we would love to welcome to this country ms malik faced three extensive national security and criminal background screenings first , homeland security officials checked her name against american law enforcement and national security databases then , her visa application went to the state department , which checked her fingerprints against other databases finally , after coming to the united states and formally marrying mr farook here , she applied for her green card and received another round of criminal and security checks ms malik also had two inperson interviews , federal officials said , the first by a consular officer in pakistan , and the second by an immigration officer in the united states when she applied for her green card all those reviews came back clear , and the fbi has said it had no incriminating information about ms malik or mr farook in its databases the state department and the have said they followed all policies and procedures the departments declined to provide any documentation or specifics about the process , saying they cannot discuss the case because of the continuing investigation meanwhile , a debate is underway at united states citizenship and immigration services , the agency that approves visas and green cards , over whether officers conducting interviews should be allowed to routinely use material gathered from social media for interviews where they assess whether foreigners are credible or pose any security risk with that issue unresolved , the agency has not regularly been using social media references , federal officials said after the terrorist last month , a furor arose over whether the united states should accept syrian refugees governors in more than two dozen states balked at accepting any but the vetting for refugees is a separate , longer and more rigorous process than the checks for k1 and most other immigrant visas and there is an extra layer of scrutiny for syrians , who are referred to a national security and fraud office at the department of homeland security for a final look in that last step , officers can include a social media search , federal officials said as part of their investigation into the electronic trail of ms malik and mr farook , investigators are searching for devices , including a computer hard drive that appeared to be missing from their home , and cellphones they might have abandoned on saturday , a team of divers from the fbi and the san bernardino county sheriff s department continued their search for those devices in seccombe lake in a park about two miles from the site of the dec 2 attack the divers pulled items from the murky waters of the lake , which they have been scouring since thursday however , officials would not specify what was found or if it was relevant to the investigation they cautioned that such searches , particularly one in a bustling public park , tend to dredge up debris from many sources , and that investigators still have to determine the value of what was found since its inception in 2002 , the department of homeland security has been trying to find the right balance between security and ease of movement a balance that equates to billions of dollars in trade and tourism each year compared to where we were 15 years ago , we 've moved the needle very far to the right on security , mr verdery said still , he said , officials have to decide who gets extra scrutiny today the government focuses its attention on people in certain fields or from certain countries foreign scientists , for instance , or young men from the middle east as a woman , ms malik likely raised less suspicion , mr verdery said investigators are particularly interested in in the years before she moved to the united states they believe that was when she was radicalized from 2007 to 2012 , she lived in a university hostel and then with her mother and sister fehda at a family home in multan , pakistan while there , ms malik studied to be a pharmacist , and she took extra classes at the local branch of a womenonly institute that teaches a strict literalist interpretation of the quran , although it does not advocate violent jihad in a brief telephone interview on saturday , the sister , fehda malik , said tashfeen malik was not an extremist , and she rejected the allegations against her sister i am the one who spent most of the time with my sister , she said no one knows her more than me she had no contact with any militant organization or person , male or female she said her sister was religious , studied the quran and prayed five times a day she knew what was right and what was wrong , fehda malik said she added that the family was very worried and tense , before hanging up the phone on social media , fehda malik has made provocative comments of her own in 2011 , on the 10th anniversary of the sept 11 attacks , she posted a remark on facebook beside a photo of a plane crashing into the world trade center that could be interpreted as antiamerican social media comments , by themselves , however , are not always definitive evidence in pakistan as in the united states there is no shortage of crass and inflammatory language and it is often difficult to distinguish islamist sentiments and those driven by political hostility toward the united states at the time fehda malik s comment was posted , antiamerican sentiment in pakistan was particularly high four months earlier , american commandos had secretly entered pakistan and killed osama bin laden
chamblee , ga witnesses to the fatal police shooting of an africanamerican man gave differing accounts tuesday but they all ended with a similar question why was it necessary to shoot anthony hill , a 27yearold air force veteran who was naked and unarmed \? the shooting , which occurred early monday afternoon , has prompted mourning , confusion and anger in the apartment complex northeast of atlanta where mr hill lived he was a calm , friendly person , said julio hernandez , 54 , a groundskeeper at the complex whose 14yearold son rode skateboards with mr hill to me , this was police abuse , because what can a naked person do \?

baltimore for nearly two years , ever since her brother tyrone west died after a struggle with the police , a 35yearold preschool teacher named tawanda jones has been in the streets here on wednesday nights , protesting her message we need killer cops in cellblocks though the officers involved in mr west s july 2013 death have been cleared of wrongdoing , his case and other policeinvolved killings here are woven into baltimore s psyche , part of what mayor stephanie rawlingsblake calls the broken relationship between residents of this majority black city and a police department with a history of aggressive , sometimes brutal behavior that history helps explain the longsimmering anger that boiled over this week with the , 25 , who suffered a severe spinal cord injury in police custody despite efforts by city officials to improve relations mayor rawlingsblake , alarmed by wrongfuldeath lawsuits , last year asked for a justice department review thousands have that are expected to continue through the weekend the tensions date back at least to 1980 , when the naacp called for a federal investigation into police brutality , and continued into the past decade with a crimefighting strategy known as zerotolerance policing that led to mass arrests since 2010 , according to the american civil liberties union of maryland , just one baltimore police officer has been prosecuted for killing a civilian an offduty officer who was convicted of shooting a marine corps veteran outside a bar this is part of a decadeslong , growing frustration over the extent to which police in baltimore have adopted a highly militarized approach to policing residents of our city , said sonia kumar , a staff lawyer with the aclu of maryland , which brought a 2006 lawsuit to change some police practices here on friday , the police said mr gray at the scene of the arrest , and confirmed he was riding in a van unbuckled , a violation of department policy over the years , we have had a number of incidents that have tarnished this badge and the reputation of this department , said police commissioner anthony batts , adding , i have been a reform commissioner the commissioner said he had fired 50 officers for misconduct , reduced excessive force and improved training since taking over the department in 2012 he dismissed calls for his resignation , saying , that s not going to happen because there is no national database of policeinvolved killings , it is difficult to draw clear conclusions about the use of deadly force by the baltimore police however , a new york times analysis of some justice department data suggests that baltimore police officers have killed more people than the police have in a number of other cities similar in size baltimore police officers killed 127 people over two decades ending in 2012 , with a marked uptick in 2007 and 2008 , according to the fbi s voluntary survey of justifiable homicides by the police the police in las vegas , who cover that metropolitan area with a similarsize force , killed 100 people over the same period in other similar cities that reported to the survey each year , including oklahoma city , memphis , and seattle where the justice department found in 2011 a pattern and practice of excessive force none reported more than half the number in baltimore last year , the baltimore sun since 2011 in judgments or settlements in 102 lawsuits alleging police misconduct a dwight pettit , a lawyer who specializes in police misconduct and represents tyrone west s family in a wrongfuldeath suit against the city , said he had 20 open cases right now , and was flooded with requests for representation mr gray was not the first black man in baltimore to emerge from a police van with a spinal cord injury jeffrey alston , who became paralyzed from the neck down after a van ride , settled for 6 million in 2004 the following year , dondi johnson , also paralyzed after a van ride , won a jury award of 74 million , though it was reduced on appeal kerry d staton , the lawyer who handled both cases , said mr johnson , like mr gray , had not been belted in mr staton said officers had intentionally given mr johnson what is known as a rough ride , where he was thrown across the vehicle into the opposite wall and broke his neck civil rights advocates and some elected officials here trace the tensions to zerotolerance policing , a crimefighting strategy championed by martin o'malley , the former governor and a potential democratic candidate for president , when he was the mayor of baltimore from 1999 to 2007 aides of mr o'malley note that on his watch , the number of annual homicides per year for the first time in more than a decade , and that violent crime in baltimore dropped by 41 percent steve kearney , a top aide to mr o'malley when he was the mayor , described the policies as appropriate for the time but zerotolerance policing led to mass arrests of people for small infractions , as well as intense community frustration , ms kumar of the aclu said countless innocent people , she added , were getting caught up in this dragnet style of policing in 2006 , the aclu and the naacp sued baltimore , alleging a broad pattern of abuse the city settled in 2010 for 870 , 000 and publicly abandoned zerotolerance policing but people here say tensions persist in mr gray s case , the police acknowledged that three bicycle officers pursued him after a lieutenant made eye contact with him and he ran away the gray family s lawyer , william murphy jr , has said mr gray was pursued for running while black that is one reason his case has provoked such an uproar here i just want them to be able , when they come into our community , not to be afraid of us , said darlene cain , a nurse s assistant who founded an advocacy group , , after her son dale graham was killed by a baltimore police officer in 2008 be able to say , hello , good morning' do n't just sit in your car and look at us like we 're the next person you want to lock up mayor rawlingsblake said that on her watch , citizen complaints alleging police discourtesy or excessive force had declined she also testified before the maryland general assembly in favor of a bill that would make it easier to investigate officer misconduct the measure , strongly opposed by the police union , never made it out of committee but two measures one doubling the maximum awards in civil lawsuits by those injured by the police , and another requiring reporting of policeinvolved killings in maryland did pass , and gov larry hogan said he intended to sign them into law against this backdrop , baltimore residents like ms jones had become increasingly vocal in recent years , long before the fatal shooting of michael brown by the police in ferguson , mo , last year put police treatment of black men on the national radar screen ms jones s brother , mr west , died after a struggle with baltimore police officers during a july 2013 traffic stop the state medical examiner ruled that he had died from a heart attack brought on by an underlying heart ailment and dehydration from the summer heat , and the city prosecutor declined to press charges but witnesses said mr west had been beaten ms jones said they had said my brother was beat so bad we 're going to need a closed casket ms rawlingsblake commissioned an independent review , which concluded that while the police had not used excessive force , missteps by the officers had created a situation that escalated into dangerous chaos ms jones and relatives have protested every wednesday night , often in front of city hall , for more than 80 weeks , vigils they call west wednesdays ms kumar , the aclu lawyer , credits the family with raising awareness here and , now that national attention is on policeinvolved killings , setting the stage for the uproar over mr gray s death mr pettit agrees so much is happening , he said lawyers like myself , community activists , for years we were screaming in the dark , and nobody was listening to us
klamath falls , ore drought in the west is an ugly thing rivers trickle away to nothing , fires rage , crops fail , ranchers go broke , tribal people watch fish die as westerners fight over the little water left , tempers crack , lawsuits fly and bitterness coats whole communities like fine dust as the climate warms , the west gets meaner the klamath river begins in southern oregon and meets the pacific ocean among the redwoods in northern california , draining nearly 16 , 000 square miles until recently , who got water and how much had been deeply contentious issues in particular , the irrigators and the indian tribes were angry at one another , and the users in the river s upper basin were angry with users in the lower basin but in recent years , something changed hostility gave way to compromise just about everybody who wants some of that precious river flow has made nice , given and taken , sat down and compromised three major agreements have been wrapped up in senate bill 133 , introduced by senator ron wyden , democrat of oregon , and several colleagues the bill is supported by tribes that want to protect the fish ranchers who want to feed their cattle farmers who grow alfalfa and potatoes fly fishermen and duck hunters ecologists a power company and many local politicians of various ideological stripes these agreements are a recipe for how to live in the arid west without bitterness compromises devised by locals there was no magic trick to it , just dogged persistence and faith that it could be done that and lots and lots of meetings , golf games , fishing trips , salmon cookouts and trips to the potato festival a slow reconciliation chronicled in a new documentary ,  the bill , the , would establish reliable water and power supplies that sustain agriculture kickstart projects that could economically benefit tribal communities fund ecosystem restoration and use ratepayer money to remove four aging private hydroelectric dams that prevent salmon from reaching the upper half of the river basin not everyone supports the agreements , and among those who do , none find all of the provisions ideal but that is the essential nature of a compromise for various reasons , the agreements require congressional approval the bill was introduced in the energy and natural resources committee in january , but it has not advanced the more than 40 parties to these agreements can maintain their tenuous compromise for only so long the agreements require that the legislation become law by dec 31 or the deal is off a decade of negotiations will evaporate , and we could be back to protracted court battles and dry bitterness perhaps the bill has been ignored in washington because it seems unimportant a parochial little water bill from a part of the country that few have even heard of but that s a mistake the strength of this bill is as a model for the west it shows how water scarcity and strong local leadership can actually foster increased cooperation among historic adversaries and produce healthy and productive ecosystems people in the klamath basin are fiercely independent if we have one thing in common out here , it is that not one of us likes being told what to do in this climate and much of the west shares this view an agreement worked out locally has perhaps the best chance of success all congress needs to do is give its blessing and authorize the agreements in 2009 , the economist won the nobel prize for effectively solving the socalled tragedy of the commons the chronic overuse of resources , like river water , that have too many users she showed that in many cases the ideal regulators of a commons were the users themselves she wrote that the key to making such systems work was that the rights of users to devise their own institutions are not challenged by external governmental authorities by letting sb 133 languish , congress is effectively challenging the right of people in the klamath basin to manage their own water we 're now in our fourth consecutive year of drought , though there really has n't been enough water to go around for 25 years this summer saw low flows and warm water in the basin the heat and stagnation caused an algae bloom on upper klamath lake and the upper reaches of the river that contained toxin levels so high that people were warned not to touch the water with this agreement \( as well as additional restoration work \) , this river has the potential to support millions of fish , even in drought years and yes , ranching and farming can continue , too , with predictable water allocations as the deadline for the passage of the klamath agreements looms , the compromise is already starting to crack on sept 15 , the yurok tribe announced that it planned to pull out , calling the agreements unachievable but there is still time to put this bill through congress to endorse this grand and unlikely compromise between old rivals for water and let it shine as a model of local solutions for the rest of the west let us turn our bitterness to sweetness pass the bill
beijing in recent days , an advice column has circulated widely on s most popular social media phone app titled guide on safe passage through the economic crisis , it is aimed at young chinese urban professionals its nuggets of wisdom include work hard at your job so you are the last to be laid off and in an economic crisis , liquidity is the number one priority zhang yuanyuan , 31 , a bank teller in shandong province , is among the thousands of people who have  last year we did n't have any yearend galas or a bonus , she said in an interview i think this year will be the same i try to spend less , she said , adding that she now buys cheaper clothes online instead of shopping in highend malls and i started carpooling with coworkers to save on gas many young middleclass chinese who grew up during the nation s glittering boom years , when doubledigit growth was the norm , are suddenly confronting the shadow of an economic slowdown , and even hints of austerity they are canceling vacations and delaying weddings and even selling recently purchased apartments to have cash on hand those who have lost money in the are especially anxious their angst poses dual problems for s leadership the ruling party bases its legitimacy on delivering high rates of growth and employment it also hopes to encourage consumer spending as a new engine of growth as the manufacturing sector slows and to nudge the economy away from an investmentdriven model eroding confidence threatens both goals these days , chinese are using the social media app wechat to look for news and advice on the economy rather than the state news media , which , at the orders of the communist party s propaganda department , have only had barebones reporting on the stock market crisis and the broader concerns over slowing economic growth earlier this month , china s central bank , the renminbi , by the largest amount in decades , signaling to outsiders that officials were worried about china s growth rate , which the government had earlier projected at 7 percent for the year then the sharp drop in the chinese stock market this week , following a steep midsummer fall that had been slowed only through muscular government intervention ,  through censorship orders , communist party officials have been trying to blunt the dire news at home not only have the main party newspapers relevant articles on their front pages , but security officials have shown a willingness to go after chinese reporters whose stories deviate from the official narrative on tuesday , a reporter for caijing , a respected financial newsmagazine , was taken away by the police to assist in the investigation of fabricating and spreading false information on futures trading , according to xinhua , the state news agency caijing had published by the reporter , wang xiaolu , saying that china s securities regulatory commission was looking to withdraw funds from the turbulent stock market despite mr wang s detention and a denial of the report from a commission representative , caijing has kept the article online the magazine saying it did not know why the police had detained mr wang but censors have yet to prevent people from using search terms related to the economy or the stock market on social media networks , so discussion is thriving online in the absence of information about the stock market on official media , chinese investors are relying on social media , primarily the two we s weibo and wechat to get news about the economy , said xiao qiang , founder of china digital times , which tracks china s media censorship he noted that wechat was particularly popular because it was less polluted by posts from governmentsupported internet users and because people could easily share news articles on the economy from western news publications , especially stories already translated into chinese the author of the widely circulated financial advice column on wechat , lin mo , once worked for a staterun business magazine , then started her own online writing about the economy she said in an interview that she had published her latest list of suggestions after getting hundreds of messages from very terrified readers responding to one of her earlier essays on what she called an economic crisis many readers were asking me things like , what should we do \? ' and , what if china becomes japan in the 80s \? ' she said they are in their early 30s the age to buy apartments or make investments or start their own businesses so they have big financial decisions to make , and in the current economy , they worry about losing those investments in the slowdown many of them are at a place in their careers where they want to leverage their current positions for higherpaying positions , and they worry about getting laid off by the new company in the economic winter , she added one reader told me that he left a stateowned travel agency to join a booming internetbased travel service because he felt he had to embrace the internet' as a young professional now he regrets that decision bitterly because the new company is having layoffs , and he might be laid off first one chinese woman who posted ms lin s column on her wechat account said it echoed the zeitgeist she had tried to sell an apartment , but said , now i think i might hold off until the market recovers a bit among the most worried are university graduates this year , nearly 75 million people graduated from universities in china , a 3 percent increase over last year the difficulty of finding employment in 2015 is still relatively high , said zhang feng , director of the career center of the ministry of education , according to an article on the both the central and local economies' growth rates have entered the new normal' victor shih , a political economist at the university of california , san diego , said the slowdown exacerbated worrisome trends in the job market highly paid professional jobs have been scarce for several years now , he said , and many young graduates have depended on their parents' connections to obtain entry positions in the government or stateowned enterprises the current downturn will hit graduates without strong connections or specialized skills ms lin said china s young strivers worry about a decline in life quality they worry about never getting that financial freedom they so badly want they worry about never being able to retire early they worry about never being able to start their own business leisure spending still exists , of course popular restaurants in beijing are crowded earlier this month , groups of chinese tourists snapped up all manner of luxury goods one weekend at galeries lafayette in paris , a highend destination tour groups shuffled through the alleys and luxury shops of venice but on zhihu , the chinese equivalent of the questionandanswer website quora , hundreds of people have submitted responses to questions from 2014 and 2015 that asked , what things do you see in your profession that indicate an economic slowdown \? the answers this year have ranged from i'm in sales commission is impossible to i'm in construction last year we got four jobs and this year none layoffs have started gao yike , 25 , who works at a real estate company in the , said in a telephone interview that the project management department laid off employees in april he said a growing number of midlevel and senior executives were leaving the real estate industry for technology companies , and that housing sales at his company were notably worse than last year the golden age of the real estate market has come to an end , he said mr gao had also lost half of his initial investments in the stock market , and he said he now planned to spend less for instance , trying to stay with friends rather than in hotels on a trip to the united states next month ms fang , an employee of a freight shipping company in beijing who asked to be identified only by her surname , said the entire shipping industry had been hit hard she said she and her husband still felt secure her husband works at a stateowned company and lives off the communist party s money but ms fang said she had stopped buying luxury goods and was consciously preventing myself from buying things that are not necessities ms zhang , the bank teller in jinan who had posted lin mo s advice column , said there could be a silver lining in the upheaval maybe the economic slowdown is not such a bad thing , she said there is less overtime work if there is no point thinking about making money , we can think about things that do n't involve making money , like spending time with parents or reading a book
madison , nh a little before noon on nov 18 , 1970 , a bloodflecked hand pawed the top of the southeast face of el capitan , the massive , 3 , 000foot vertical wall in yosemite national park known to climbers as the dawn wall a bearded , wildeyed man eventually pulled himself up and stumbled back into the realm of horizontal existence after 26 nights lashed to the cliff approximately 70 reporters and wellwishers rushed forward to greet him a dozen tv cameras whirred in california s beatnik climbing circles , warren harding , who completed the first ascent of yosemite s grandest wall that day with his partner , dean caldwell , stood out for his penchant for fast sports cars and beautiful women and for his voracious consumption of red wine when asked why he climbed , he responded , succinctly because we are insane some years later , mr harding , retired from serious climbing , attended a party in estes park , colo , at the home of mike caldwell \( no relation to dean caldwell \) , a climber and guide mike introduced mr harding to his 5yearold son , a towhead named tommy this week , it is his bloodied hands that are pawing relentlessly toward the summit of the tommy caldwell , 36 , is poised with a partner , kevin jorgeson , 30 , to make history by becoming the first to free climb the same face mr harding and mr caldwell conquered the distinction is that in free climbing , climbers use only their hands , feet , arms and legs to make upward progress and not the bolts , pitons and other contrivances mr harding and his partner used , and for which they were criticized in free climbing , ropes and other equipment are used only to stop a fall many climbers consider the caldwelljorgeson effort , begun on dec 27 , to be perhaps the most difficult free climb ever attempted the anticipation and spectacle surrounding it an adventure that , thanks to cellphones , social media and the internet , has been shared by millions of people surpass anything imaginable in mr harding s day and like mr harding s ascent , this one has not come without some skepticism and bewilderment about all the fuss spending two to three weeks on the route , surrounded by camera crews , fixed lines , and other media accoutrements getting goodies brought up to you by friends does n't something about all that seem a little out of place in the middle of el capitan \? chris kalman , a climber , asked this week on his blog , where , i repeat , is the adventure \? but mr kalman acknowledged in a postscript that he was rooting for them i 've got my fingers crossed although some 13 other fulllength routes on el cap have been free climbed , none of those come close to the sustained level of difficulty the dawn wall presents it took tommy caldwell , who has free climbed 11 of those other routes , more than anyone else , seven years to piece together a way up the wall he methodically explored the sheer face by rappelling down from the top of el capitan on reconnaissance missions , searching for the tiniest wrinkles in the smooth rock to pull himself upward he fell hundreds of times while attempting the route s numerous pitches \( a pitch is a segment of climbing less than the length of a rope \) , though he was caught each time by his rope the resulting route is a masterpiece the hardest section , pitches 14 and 15 , involved traversing horizontally across the blankest portion of the wall for more than 300 feet this required the power and coordination of an olympic gymnast and the footwork of a ballerina the potatochipthin rock flakes to which mr caldwell clung on this passage left deep lacerations on his fingertips \( as of midday thursday , mr jorgeson had not completed pitch 15 \) their climb is in contrast to the ascent by mr harding and his partner they tenaciously built a ladder up the cliff out of pitons , bolts and nylon slings back then , over campfires and in the pages of climbing journals , some of mr harding s more highminded peers grumbled that he played up his climbs for media attention and employed a heavyhanded style of ascent , drilling too many holes into the rock for expansion bolts to aid his climb with enough bolts and patience , critics complained , any piece of rock could be climbed i felt like screaming , one climber , t m herbert , wrote at the time in the american alpine journal they bolted the thing , he added , and they sold it to millions on television ! technology and the media may bring viewers closer than ever before to these intense endeavors , but in mr harding s day , they could have the curious effect of dehumanizing both the personalities and the experience only mr harding s real friends knew , for instance , that in truth he remained devoted to but one woman his mother when asked how it felt to see her 46yearold son high up on the dawn wall , making history , she replied , this is the longest warren s ever been away from home mr harding died in 2002 at age 77 now mike caldwell checks in regularly with his son for updates by cellphone tommy also facetimes daily with his wife and young son , fitz , from the wall this is a pleasant change from the tales of death and disaster that most often thrust climbing into the news the climbing community will sort out for itself what techniques are fair , and what s baloney the beauty of the endeavor , as mr harding surely would understand , is that ultimately each and every climber gets to define his or her own meaning of adventure
plateau de beille , france it was only the by association , and it was not even a race but was indeed back riding his bike on french roads thursday the return of armstrong , the disgraced american rider whose seven tour wins were stripped from him for doping , was not received with universal enthusiasm by the french , the cycling establishment or many of the cyclists in the actual tour reuters reported that there were no fans , but dozens of journalists , when armstrong stepped off a bus in muret for a charity ride that more or less followed the route planned for friday s stage armstrong , however , was not much on the minds of the riders who gathered about 62 miles away for thursday s actual tour start in lannemezan about lance he s not on the line with us , we 're not going to see him , it s a nonevent for us , chris froome , the leader of the tour , said wednesday evening armstrong s return was a more deluxe version of what dozens of cyclists do daily he had been invited to france by geoff thomas , a retired british soccer star , to raise money for a leukemia charity by riding two stage routes ahead of the race brian cookson , the president of the international cycling union , the governing body commonly known as uci , was among the many who said that even a worthy cause did not justify armstrong s returning to haunt the fringes of the tour i know that geoff thomas is very genuine in his charitable work , cookson said in an emailed statement but i continue to believe that s involvement in this ride is inappropriate during the ride , armstrong noted that other riders who were found to be doping retain prominent positions at the tour larger than life images of richard virenque , who led the festina team that was the focus of police drug raids in 1998 , adorn vehicles promoting festina watches at the tour why am i not welcome \? because i'm a doper \? armstrong said if you 're going to apply a standard , it has to be universal thursday s stage 12 , which featured four mountain climbs , had the potential to be decisive several teams , including froome s team sky , had ridden the route ahead of time to look for possible danger spots and attacking opportunities on its mainly narrow and twisting , if scenic , roads in the end , sky s control of the race meant that it had no effect on froome s overall lead or the secondplace standing of the american tejay van garderen , who remains 2 minutes 52 seconds behind but the stage , which finished with a solo win by joaquim rodr guez , a spaniard with the russian katusha team , was raced in conditions that included weather extremes much of the day was spent in temperatures so hot that sections of the road were sprayed with water to ease the riders' burden but when the riders reached the final steep climb to the plateau de beille finish , they endured an electrical storm with plunging temperatures , hail and heavy rain an unusually large break of 22 riders led the race for most of the stage none were contenders for the overall lead the challengers floated in and around and , for the most part , behind froome and his teammates as the bad weather arrived and the finish neared , michal kwiatkowski , a polish rider who is the current world road racing champion , launched a solo attack that looked as if it might succeed but he was ultimately overtaken by rodr guez , who arrived at the finish with enough of a time gap , 1 12 , to perform a protracted and complex series of victory salutes afterward , rodr guez , who was third in the 2013 tour , which froome won , said that he had given up hope of challenging for the overall victory after suffering from the hunger knock from inadequate eating during the first two stages in the pyrenees this week with his new focus on stage wins , rodr guez said the plateau de beille was particularly appealing i know it off by heart , he said , because of frequent training forays to the climb from over the nearby border with spain rodr guez also seems to thrive in bad weather he won the 2012 tour of lombardy , one of the last major events of the season , in similarly dreadful conditions at the tour , he is using a custom saddle that displays his nickname , purito , on the band of a cigar lighting and exploding a stick of dynamite the name can mean little cigar in spanish accounts vary about its origins but the most common one is that early in his career , he passed more senior and accomplished teammates on a climb while arrogantly miming the smoking of a cigar armstrong s ride with nine men and two women had the heat but not the storm and included a restaurant stop for lunch rather than a feed sack caught and eaten on the move while the tour gave him a cold shoulder , some french bystanders said they welcomed armstrong s return to their country , and he was applauded when he stopped for lunch it s not nice what he did , jacques pylyp , a 53yearold resident of villefranched'albigeois , where armstrong ate at the barry restaurant , told agence francepresse armstrong told the hordes of reporters that he has been watching the tour this year asked if it was now clean , he replied how can i answer that question \? i am not a specialist
now all of us single people are pathetic , not just the straight ones marriage responds to the universal fear that a lonely person might call out only to find no one there , writes of the supreme court in as i read that bit alone in my apartment , i choked on my coffee is n't it enough to be denied the constellation of benefits that the states have linked to marriage \? a constellation my coupled queer sisters and brethren now can hold dearly if they just make it official \? once again , being single is the dreary , awful , mournful alternative to marriage a condition to be pitied , and quickly corrected by a sprint to city hall as i read on , i started to wonder how justices sonia sotomayor and elena kagan two of the most highprofile single women in the federal government felt as they reviewed and had to join justice kennedy s opinion no union is more profound than marriage , for it embodies the highest ideals of love , fidelity , devotion , sacrifice , and family senator lindsey graham of south carolina , a republican presidential hopeful , is also single , and has had to endure some humiliating questions about his marital status , including who would be his first lady well , i 've got a sister , she could play that role if necessary , i wonder how the senator felt , after last week s decision , when he learned that to be denied marriage is to be condemned to live in loneliness , excluded from one of civilization s oldest institutions \? marriage equality activists could have pursued a different agenda challenging the need for sexual scrutiny by the state , and the constellation of benefits that belong to marriage but they did n't instead of dreaming up new forms of governance , they asked to be ruled by the ones that already exist and so old questions remain why ca n't i put a good friend on my health care plan \? why ca n't my neighbor and i file our taxes together so we could save some money , as my parents do \? if i failed to make a will , why is it unlikely a dear friend would inherit my estate \? the answers to all these questions are the same it s because i'm not having sex with those people \( to make matters worse , that also means we probably did n't have children together \) for the only thing that truly distinguishes romance and marriage from other loving intimacies like friendships , other familial relationships and close business partnerships is that sex is \( or once was \) part of the picture so yes , marriage equality erases an odious and invidious distinction among straight and us notstraight citizens for which i'm truly glad and which i celebrate and it 'll make lots of people s lives better but it also leaves unexamined the reason sex seems to give you benefits and recognition and why it orders the world and civilization in granting samesex couples equal dignity in the eyes of the law , justice kennedy throws everyone under the just married limo dignity the state of being worthy of honor or respect is undeniably appealing one reading of the majority opinion suggests , however , one is n't dignified unless one can be married but some of us ca n't or wo n't ever find that special someone we might not have the luck or the timing or the inclination if dignity is predicated on being lucky in love , then what happens when your luck runs out \? well , you join \( or 1246 million \) of america s adults , according to bureau of labor statistics last year and that means that you 'll be misunderstood as living a miserable , lonely life by the other 498 percent they 'll deny you adequate language , representation and consideration except as the thing to avoid becoming even if you 're having a happy , rewarding life , they 'll assume you 're not but singleness includes at some point , even those who are married love ends spouses cheat someone dies first to be in a marriage , no matter how strong , is always a precarious condition , which means that the dignity you 've been given can be taken away at any moment the grim implication we 're all condemned to the everpresent shadow characterization of singleness for at least some time , doomed to call out only to find no one there , which binds us more desperately to the marriage imperative and rights that are n't ours , no matter how hard we love a marriage equality based upon dignity makes pathetic singles of us all certainly justice kennedy s sense of marital dignity is over the top but it s not just sentimental rhetoric it s a kind of legal term of heart that can keep you up at night the words and the value they communicate are impossible to avoid , and often difficult to resist it s as if the words of justice kennedy and my grandmother , who , on her deathbed , begged me to get married , have melded together in my head , declaring my life lacking emotions meet law and then throw me into a state of emotional insecurity i am usually a relatively happy single person who wrote a book advocating for the dignity of single people \( a colleague asked if i was writing that book so i could get more dates \) but even i hear coupledom s call i sometimes crave a longterm relationship with that great guy i watch ang lee s take on sense and sensibility monthly i 've been in a number of relationships that broke my heart all of which feels very undignified but none of those longings , hauntings and hurts should pave the way for my constitutional dignity i already feel too governed from the inside of my anxious heart , which does n't make , as my grandmother certainly knew , the best choices if you 're truly lucky in this life , you might have many relationships that embody , in varying degrees , the highest ideals of love , fidelity , devotion , sacrifice , and family , whether or not those relationships include sex better yet , these relationships might give you a general feeling of dignity , wellbeing and justice being single does n't mean that the world is empty and awful senator graham reminded people that his life was not destitute without a wife i 've got a lot of friends we 'll have a rotating first lady what justice kennedy , and everyone else too , needs to remember is that simply being yourself your single self is already the fundamental form of dignity founding your dignity on something as flimsy and volatile as a sexual connection insures dignity s precariousness as it enshrines your inherent unworthiness as a single individual
it has long appeared that the republican obsession with investigating the 2012 terrorist attack in benghazi , libya was not a genuine attempt to get the facts behind a tragic incident in which four americans , including the united states ambassador , lost their lives but a partisan witch hunt targeting hillary rodham clinton , the frontrunner for the 2016 democratic presidential nomination now there is proof of the duplicity and political chicanery behind the creation of the select committee on benghazi it was hamhandedly exposed by representative kevin mccarthy , who , in his quest to become the next speaker of the house , couldn t resist boasting about what he considers his party s major political accomplishment everybody thought hillary clinton was unbeatable , right \? mr mccarthy , republican of california , told fox news but we put together a benghazi special committee , a select committee , what are her numbers today \? her numbers are dropping , why \? because she s untrustable but no one would have known any of that had happened now under heavy criticism for telling the truth and with his bid for speaker at risk , mr mccarthy is trying to walk back his remarks , but it won t work despite wasting 45 million and conducting one of the longest congressional probes in history , the committee has shed no significant new light on the benghazi attack it would be surprising if it did several other congressional committees and a panel of outside experts commissioned by the state department have investigated the attack and the government s response they concluded that the tragedy was preventable and condemned systemic failures at senior levels of the state department but none found evidence that mrs clinton , then secretary of state , was specifically to blame or produced any other bombshell to support some wild republican conspiracy theories those earlier probes didn t keep the republicans from exploiting the issue for political gain by establishing the special committee , whose focus has segued from benghazi to the fact that as secretary mrs clinton used a private email account to hear democratic lawmakers tell it , the republicans have thoroughly perverted any semblance of a fair process by calling and interviewing witnesses without bothering to include the committee s minority members the committee should be disbanded and if the republican leadership refuses to do that , then the panel s democratic members should resign manipulating government funds for political purposes in this way may well violate congressional ethics rules , as democratic leader nancy pelosi has suggested there is little reason to expect that republicans , united in defeating mrs clinton at all costs , care enough to do anything about it
minneapolis two tense games in the wnba s western conference finals reduced minnesota lynx coach cheryl reeve s voice to a rasp it had mostly recovered by midweek , when reeve , dressed in blueandgray lynx sweats , directed practice but it was not exactly right , and that bothered her is it better \? she asked i tried everything it s hard this time of year part teacher , part taskmaster and part tactician , reeve is as much the voice and driving force of the lynx franchise as the american olympians maya moore , seimone augustus and lindsay whalen are the faces the lynx qualified for the playoffs only twice in 11 seasons before reeve , a former college head coach and wnba assistant , arrived in 2010 after a 1321 first season , reeve directed the lynx to the league finals four times in five years , winning titles in 2011 and 2013 reeve has the best regularseason winning percentage of any coach in league history \( 14064 , 686 \) , and the second best in the postseason \( 268 , 742 \) , trailing only the former phoenix coach paul westhead moore , augustus , whalen and the rugged forward rebekkah brunson , all captains , hold everything together last sunday , moore s steal and subsequent foul shot on a controversial call in the final seconds capped a 40point performance and helped the lynx eliminate phoenix , the defending champion , 7271 , to advance to the bestoffive finals the lynx will meet the eastern conference champions , the indiana fever , on sunday in game 1 at target center but the winning culture stems from reeve , the daughter of a career air force noncommissioned officer she is an intense competitor who demands excellence from herself and everyone around her , referees included during a game this season , officials mishandled an unusual freethrow situation reeve , who was a rhodes scholarship nominee at la salle university , cited the proper procedure and added , i do n't know if the officials really understand the rules that drew an undisclosed fine from the league and basketball fans may remember what reeve calls the infamous jacket toss in game 2 of the 2012 wnba finals protesting a noncall in an extremely physical game , reeve drew a technical foul and then flung her gray jacket at the bench , where the assistant coach shelley patterson caught it it took another assistant coach , jim petersen , a former nba player , and the veteran center taj mcwilliamsfranklin to calm her down the lynx won that game , but they lost the next two and the series reeve said the lynx had complained to the league before game 2 that the physical play was getting out of hand when it continued , she felt frustrated , which led to her reaction i ca n't say i regretted it , reeve said it was just me , how the fiery passion was displayed i try to catch myself you can only do those things once in a lifetime i just have to be me in the moment , i can tell you , the overriding feeling was i had to protect my players , and what was happening was wrong a former point guard at la salle , reeve earned a master s degree in business administration and interned with the internal revenue service , but she preferred coaching she came to minnesota after 12 seasons as a college coach and nine as a wnba assistant , the final four under bill laimbeer in detroit when the shock moved to tulsa , laimbeer joined the minnesota timberwolves as an assistant he urged the lynx s executive vice president , roger griffith , to hire reeve , whose only head coaching experience had been at indiana state from 1995 to 2000 the lynx already had augustus and brunson , and griffith acquired whalen a month after reeve arrived reeve took a cerebral approach to the game she stressed defense and rebounding , keeping track of deflections and statistics related to hustle she demanded that augustus , a scorer , become her best defender when the lynx drafted moore and signed mcwilliamsfranklin as a free agent in 2011 , reeve had all the pieces to succeed she is the most prepared coach i 've ever met in my life , augustus said she knows numbers , statistics , the rate at which we score , plays , possessions , timing , you name it she can break the game down to a mustard seed it opened our minds to watching game films , breaking down our games , seeing where we can be effective on the court that made me 10 times better than what i was when i got here in 2006 though demonstrative on the bench , reeve is not intense all the time she pushes players but knows when to back off and encourage when you have someone constantly showing you the proper way to do something , cheering you on when you do it and scolding you when you do n't , you know you can play for them , said mcwilliamsfranklin , now the head coach at post , a division ii university in waterbury , conn you can work your hardest she does n't overwork you and expect you to consistently perform that s the kind of loyalty she inspires because you know she wants the best for you reeve and her staff may have done their best coaching this season , integrating center sylvia fowles and guards anna cruz and renee montgomery none of whom were with the team in training camp into their system while augustus \( right knee surgery and sprained left foot \) and whalen \( strained right achilles' tendon \) missed stretches this year , there s no question nothing has been easy , reeve said externally , everybody goes , ah , they 're going to be in the finals' there s not a person that is a part of this who had any foregone conclusions , and getting there is so hard you do n't know if you 're ever getting back to the finals we did n't get into the finals last year when the buzzer sounded to get us in the finals , the older ones , you could kind of see it in the celebration afterward they were so thankful and so appreciative to renee montgomery , anna cruz , sylvia fowles , coming and staying together and figuring it out
how many sopranos does it take to turn in a revival of tosca \? four , it seems also four conductors , two leading tenors and four baritones to share the role of the baddie luc bondy s frostylouche production of this puccini melodrama returned to the on friday in a satisfying performance led by the incisive ukrainian soprano oksana dyka and conducted , often brilliantly , by marco armiliato twelve more are scheduled , but none feature the opening night s lineup for potential ticket buyers , choosing a night to see tosca this fall can resemble a game of fantasy football , with nine different configurations mr armiliato wo n't be conducting any of them he stepped in to replace pl cido domingo , who underwent gallbladder surgery and is expected to return to the pit in november the powerful tenor roberto aronica will anchor the cast as cavaradossi , although marcello giordani will take over the role for several performances in november always impressive for the sheer volume of his top notes , mr aronica grew in warmth and expressive ardor on friday , culminating in a deeply affecting rendition of e lucevan le stelle ms dyka was irresistible in the first act , in which a playful tosca flirts with her beau as politics , torture and the threat of sexual violence darkened her character s world , ms dyka s voice took on a keener glint her exclamations of horror and outrage at the end were delivered with searing intensity but while cavaradossi s character seemed to grow in selfknowledge and moral stature in mr aronica s portrayal , ms dyka s tosca was most radiant and most fully herself in the innocent world of act i it will be interesting to see how the sopranos , and liudmyla monastyrska chart tosca s trajectory as scarpia , the baritone roberto frontali often sounded pale and rigid his portrayal of that sadistic police chief was efficiently repulsive , but lacked the flashes of humanity that can give the character depth perhaps the scarpias of james morris , marco vratogna and zeljko lucic will reveal more about the psychology of a character who openly compares himself to iago in that regard , mr lucic , as that villain in verdi s otello , might have an edge
addis ababa , ethiopia jabbed at the power structures of africa on tuesday by calling for longentrenched leaders to step down , using offthecuff remarks about his own political standing and his stature as the first american president with african roots to try to reshape the continent s politics i actually think i'm a pretty good president , mr obama told diplomats from across africa , departing from his prepared text to present himself as a model for giving up power when term limits are reached i think if i ran , i could win there s a lot that i 'd like to do to keep america moving , he added but the law is the law , and no person is above the law , not even the president whether mr obama could actually win another term may provide fodder for political debate at home he has appeared energized by a string of recent successes , including congressional passage of trade authority , a ruling upholding his health care plan , a nuclear deal with and the reopening of diplomatic relations with still , he faces deep opposition among many americans who are critical of his economic and foreign policies but as he wrapped up what may be his final trip to africa while in office , mr obama used his own tenure to take on one of the continent s most enduring obstacles to democratic progress its history of oneman rule by presidents and potentates who enrich themselves and cling to power for years , if not decades , in calcified regimes nobody should be president for life , he declared in a speech at the , an umbrella organization your country is better off if you have new blood and new ideas i'm still a pretty young man , but i know that somebody with new energy and new insights will be good for my country it will be good for yours , too , in some cases this is a theme that mr obama hit forcefully during his visit to in 2009 , when he declared that africa does n't need strongmen it needs strong institutions since then , the debate over inveterate rulers has continued to reverberate across africa , with startlingly different outcomes just this month , the president of pushed ahead with elections that gave him a third term in office in doing so , he threw his nation into upheaval in a move widely regarded as violating the country s constitution and a peace agreement that ended a devastating there in rwanda , lawmakers voted this month to support a constitutional change allowing president paul kagame a third term the government of collapsed last fall when protesters surged through the streets , denouncing president s plans to extend his 27year rule and in the democratic republic of congo , there are concerns that president joseph kabila will try to circumvent the twoterm limit outlined in the constitution by delaying the 2016 presidential election indeed , about half of the more than 50 countries in the african union have presidents , prime ministers or monarchs who have been in power longer than mr obama , some of them for decades teodoro obiang nguema mbasogo has ruled equatorial guinea since 1979 robert mugabe has been in power in zimbabwe since 1980 paul biya has governed cameroon since 1982 yoweri museveni has governed uganda since 1986 omar hassan albashir has governed sudan since 1989 on the other hand , there have been transformative moments lately in , the continent s most populous nation , africans celebrated in the spring when the party that had governed since the end of military rule peacefully stepped down after losing elections , in one of the world s largest democracies unable to travel to nigeria because of security concerns , mr obama decided to mark that transition by playing host to the new nigerian president , muhammadu buhari , in the oval office last week before departing for his trip here none of the longruling leaders mr obama seemed to have in mind were on hand to hear his speech on tuesday , but representatives of governments from around africa attended , and it was broadcast live across the continent the audience interrupted mr obama with applause nearly 75 times , but it cheered and whooped most enthusiastically as he talked about leaders who overstay their welcome when a leader tries to change the rules in the middle of the game just to stay in office , it risks instability and strife , as we 've seen in burundi , mr obama said and this is often just a first step down a perilous path and sometimes you 'll hear leaders say , well , i'm the only person who can hold the nation together' if that s true , then that leader has failed to truly build their nation the crowd cheered even louder when he said that he did not understand why leaders do not step down especially when they 've got a lot of money , again going beyond his prepared text in a knowing reference to african officials who have accumulated great fortunes while in office , often through corruption joseph attamensah , a ghanaian who is a policy adviser at the united nations economic commission for africa , said mr obama s message was critically important one of the most important things was , in terms of good governance and institutions , the need for people to leave when their term is up , he said they should leave and allow for new blood i think that was good still , some analysts were skeptical about the potential impact of mr obama s remarks i think it has little direct impact on leaders , who can play up sovereignty , said pierre englebert , an african politics expert at pomona college beyond that , he cited american support for , or silence on , some autocratic african governments the us is not consistent in delivering this message , so that weakens it , he said mr obama s tone on tuesday was more forceful than when he visited and earlier on the trip in , where the deputy president faces charges of in the international criminal court and the country s president faced them until december , preferred to focus on what he saw as movement in the right direction , particularly a fiveyearold constitution meant to resolve disputes that arose out of contested 2007 elections as for , where the ruling party and its allies just won of the seats in parliament and where journalists have repeatedly been imprisoned for criticizing the government , mr obama gently urged greater progress while expressing understanding of the country s difficult history aides said that in private , s leaders were unusually candid in acknowledging flaws in their system and seemed committed to change finding the right balance between advocating democracy and human rights on the one hand , and cultivating cooperation on other issues like economics and security on the other , has been a challenge for mr obama no matter where he travels he came away with a sour aftertaste following the socalled arab spring , when countries in the middle east and north africa cast off autocrats only to fail to install successful democracies while making his way across east africa over the last four days , mr obama repeatedly defended his decision to come to and ethiopia , which no other sitting president has visited , despite their records he noted that he has also traveled to china and russia , which are hardly model democracies but he carries special weight in africa , where he is seen as a favorite son with a symbolic power no predecessor had when nkosazana dlaminizuma , the chairwoman of the african union , introduced him on tuesday , she said , although we welcome you as the president of the united states , we also claim you as our own mr obama understood that speaking in nelson mandela plenary hall , named for the south african freedom fighter turned president , mr obama said mr mandela , like george washington , understood that leaving office and handing over control peacefully was a powerful legacy just as the african union has condemned coups and illegitimate transfers of power , the au s authority and strong voice can also help the people of africa ensure that their leaders abide by term limits and their constitutions , mr obama said understanding that some might see him as lecturing or hypocritical , mr obama made a point of acknowledging american flaws our american democracy is not perfect , he said but one thing we do is we continually reexamine to figure out how can we make our democracy better and that s a force of strength for us , being willing to look and see honestly what we need to be doing to fulfill the promise of our founding documents in boasting that he could win another term if the 22nd amendment did not forbid it , mr obama mirrored comments president bill clinton has made but unlike mr clinton , who often said he would have loved to have remained president , mr obama echoed his immediate predecessor , president george w bush , in talking wistfully of what he looks forward to doing once he leaves office i 'll be honest with you , he said , i'm looking forward to life after being president i wo n't have such a big security detail all the time it means i can go take a walk i can spend time with my family i can find other ways to serve i can visit africa more often while in kenya , mr obama was forced to stay in tightly controlled facilities and settings , unable to visit the village where his family came from or explore nairobi , which he last visited in 2006 his stepgrandmother told reporters that she urged him to come to the family village to pray at his father s grave he later told reporters that a dinner with relatives was spent begging for forgiveness that he could not be with them longer
washington representative mimi walters of california is the freshman class envoy to the republican house leadership team , and she is the only republican woman from her state in the house so it is no surprise that she is already attracting attention a former mayor of laguna niguel , calif , and a state legislator , ms walters arrived in congress from california s 45th district ready to learn one of the best tips so far came from representative susan w brooks , republican of indiana women can wear their congressional pin on a chain as a necklace ms walters , 52 , showed off the pin during an interview , which has been condensed below listen , this thing took me 18 years to get , she said , referring to her career in elected office , and it s the most expensive piece of jewelry i own you are the mother of four children between the ages of 18 and 22 how did that prepare you for the rigors of congress \? i'm used to solving lots of conflicts , and i actually think that that experience being a mom , especially with kids so close in age has prepared me for this job , because there s so many competing interests and you have to oftentimes find resolutions to disagreements the 2010 class was the class in broad strokes , what do you think is the goal and tone of the freshman class of the 114th congress \? this freshman class wants to get things done and is very solutionoriented and so far i can tell that we 're really working well together , and we want to move our agenda forward any key issues \? i think unanimously we 're all very concerned about jobs and making sure that we create more jobs for people in america you have said you would like to be a mentor to other women what advice do you give women considering a run for office , who are balancing the demands of parenting and family \? it is a big demand and i think what women need is just the confidence that they can do it and one of the ways they 'll get the confidence they can do it is that they see other women doing it i mean , i 've had to juggle my four kids i have a husband i still run the house i pay all the bills none of that has changed being 3 , 000 miles away my husband is very supportive and very helpful , but ultimately , i have always felt that that has been my responsibility and , you know , we make it work recently , women in the republican conference helped on a 20week ban on abortions because they felt it did not do enough to accommodate victims of rape what concerns , if any , did you raise behind the scenes \? i did have a concern about the language , and many of the members of the freshman class came to me men and women , voicing their concern and being at the leadership table , i was able to voice the concern to the leaders you are from california when it comes to immigration , what in your ideal world would you like to see happen \? we need immigration reform , there s no question , but we need congress to make the reforms and put them into law we need to secure the border we need to decide what we 're going to do with the 11 million people that are in this country we need a guest worker program agriculture very badly needs this problem resolved does your comprehensive plan at some point include some form of legal status for the 11 million immigrants already here illegally \? i would support a pathway to legalization for those 11 million that are here , but you have to remember that people have gone through this process already , and we should not be putting those people ahead of the people that have gone through the process another issue we have to deal with are people who are here on expired visas we need to have reform when it comes to our visas you have described yourself a practical conservative what does that mean \? i have a philosophy of limited government and accountability , and i believe that people should keep more of their money when they work hard , and not have government take their money from them , because i think people can spend their money more wisely but i'm also very practical that government s job is to sometimes help those people who need help not to give them money to just give them money , but to give them tools to help bring them out of poverty and sometimes we have to make decisions that i'm not necessarily going to agree with everything in a piece of legislation , but i 'll take 80 percent i do n't have to be 100 percent purist you come to congress with a lot of local political experience but what has surprised you most about congress so far \? the pace here is pretty fast i mean , i was busy in the state senate , but i'm really busy here , and just being new , trying to learn my way around has been a challenge i think a challenge for everybody but i love it it s an honor did you get any good tips from female members \? i know it can be hard just with the shoes , walking on the marble all day i will not wear high heels two days in a row i now have brought many flats back from california here , because it s just too difficult i 've fallen down twice already , and it s a little embarrassing i did n't expect i 'd be having to walk as much but it s great , because you get to stay in shape
the prophecy that the would win the world series in 2015 , from the book of biff , may have been false , after all the back to the future franchise never delivered on its promise of hover boards , either you ca n't believe everything you see the modern cubs might not believe what has happened to them in the first two games of this national league championship series , either they rolled into citi field with 101 victories , postseason included , since opening day , and now have lost twice to the  they lost in game 1 with jon lester , who forever proved his postseason mettle by winning all three starts he made for the boston red sox across two world series they lost 41 in game 2 with jake arrieta , who had been 181 over the last four months that was an even better stretch than the 1984 joy ride of rick sutcliffe he came to the cubs in a midseason trade and went 171 through his first start in the then he started the decisive game in san diego and lost but the circumstances might have been beyond the cubs' control then , as now as the hoary legend goes , a tavern owner named william sianis tried to bring a goat named murphy to wrigley field for the 1945 world series the goat was denied entry , and sianis vowed that the cubs would win no more they lost that world series stopping at 101 overall wins , by the way and the next time they reached the postseason , in 1984 , sutcliffe s winning run ended at jack murphy stadium in 2003 the year of the goat , in the chinese new year calendar the cubs lost to the marlins in a sevengame nlcs and now this lester and arrieta have both allowed homers to the mets' october sensation , daniel murphy he s probably the god of new york right now , said miguel montero , the cubs' catcher i totally respect that he s earned it of course , this murphy and goat stuff is pure silliness , as all curses are the red sox sold babe ruth , and the gods allowed them to win again the white sox lost a world series on purpose , and they have won , too keeping a smelly goat from entering a ballpark just seems like sound hygiene , not a reason to disrupt the hardball cosmos theo epstein , the cubs' president for baseball operations , presided over the 2004 boston champions , so he has seen painful history dissolve on a diamond you tend to believe him when he says that these cubs , managed by joe maddon , are not burdened by their past if you create a culture where the guys care more about each other than themselves , and they care more about each other than what s going on in the outside world , i do n't think any of those narratives no matter how old and stale or historic and resonant and meaningful matter to anyone , he said last week , after the cubs clinched their division series all they really care about is showing up , having fun , embracing what it means to be a cub and playing at their best when it matters most , and i think you saw that here they pick up on joe s energy they 're out there doing it for each other and the whole organization really , the things that are written about us , the pressure , how quiet it sometimes gets in the ballpark when something goes wrong , none of that stuff bothers these guys fair enough , but that last observation is worth remembering the series now shifts to wrigley field at once charming , picturesque , boozy and anxietyfilled for games 3 and 4 , after a workout day kyle hendricks is scheduled to start on tuesday against the mets' jacob degrom , a matchup that heavily favors the mets and underscores their great advantage so far this postseason for all of the aces they have faced clayton kershaw and zack greinke of the los angeles dodgers , before lester and arrieta the mets have the deepest rotation , and their starters can match or outperform anyone they 're going to be really , really good , and we 're really proud of as fast as they 've come and the way they 've handled themselves this summer , mets manager terry collins said we think we can stack up with anybody the mets are not the only team whose best pitchers have exceeded their previous career highs in innings , either arrieta is 29 and extremely fit , with no tommy john surgery on his medical chart but until this season , he had never exceeded 1762 3 professional innings in a season in 2015 , including the postseason , he is four outs shy of 250 maddon said the innings could be taking a toll on arrieta , who was not throwing as hard as usual on sunday when that happens , maddon said , hitters see everything better and breaking balls are not as effective he was not laboring to throw the ball , maddon said it just was n't as crisp as it had been arrieta said he was conditioned as well or better than anybody , and that he does not rely on having his best fastball every night he said murphy hit a good curveball for the homer , but acknowledged his stuff was not sharp i know i did n't have the life , the really good life , arrieta said i knew it was n't there but physically , i feel great there s really zero soreness at all just every now and again , sometimes that stuff happens you might not have that explosiveness that you 're used to featuring , but that s what pitching is about , being able to understand what s happening , how your body s responding and pitch accordingly after the first three batters single , double , homer arrieta permitted one infield single and two walks , striking out eight yet the fiveinning outing matched his shortest of the season , and those first three hitters decided the game like matt harvey against lester in game 1 , the mets' noah syndergaard was simply better five and twothirds innings , three hits , one run , one walk , nine strikeouts when they 're hitting their spots , it s not easy to do what we want to do when they 're doing what they want to do , said the cubs' anthony rizzo but every pitcher makes mistakes and we 've just got to capitalize on them as they head home , the cubs are running out of time to do that
beijing for the past month , i have been banned from giving interviews , and so i am offering this essay to mark the 26th anniversary of the crackdown of june 4 , 1989 , when the authorities suppressed dissent in cities across china the big news these days is the communist party s campaign against corruption in the three years since the 18th party congress , which installed the current generation of china s leaders , the government has called on officials to slay tigers and swat flies a metaphor for targeting all kinds of corruption , big and small while the government has periodically cracked down on graft , there has not been an anticorruption campaign on this scale but that does n't mean there was n't corruption in fact , during the two decades after s famous southern tour of china in 1992 when , in semiretirement , he traveled to guangdong province to forcefully promote economic liberalization officials at all levels of the communist party quietly got rich tolerating corruption was , in fact , part of what deng unleashed deng , china s paramount leader from 1978 until his death in 1997 , is today revered as a hero and , like mao zedong before him and xi jinping after him , deng is portrayed by the party as a political theorist but there was no such thing as a deng xiaoping theory , any more than there was such a thing as qin shihuang theory like qin shihuang , the first emperor , who centralized political authority in china , deng used force , not theory he leveraged the power that mao had won for the communist party to march china along his new deng xiaoping road toward an abyss of corruption there is one difference few people today commend qin shihuang s policy of burning books and confucian scholars but smoke from the incense burned in praise of the deng road continues to reach the heavens focusing on the widespread corruption in china today while forgetting the role of deng is like blaming the gang of four for the tumultuous destruction of the cultural revolution \( 196676 \) while overlooking the role of mao deng famously said that to open the economy , the party would have to let some people get rich first this was one of the most creative policies ever advocated by a communist party leader , as it was in direct contradiction to the party s founding aim at the time of deng s southern tour , i was in prison , having been removed from office in 1989 along with my patron , the former prime minister and party general secretary zhao ziyang at first , when i read the publicly available texts , i did n't really get what he was driving at what made a deep impression was his hard tone , exemplified by three lines , quoted everywhere if we do n't change , we are at a dead end ! whoever does n't reform will have to step down ! some people will get rich first ! despite deng s tough talk , neither the outline nor the substance of his policy was clear who were these people who were going to get rich first \? deng might have meant those the communist party supposedly represented the workerpeasant alliance or , perhaps , those classes that had then only recently been rehabilitated by the party landlords , wealthy peasants , counterrevolutionaries , the bad elements , the rightists he might even have been talking about intellectuals , with their knowledge and technological skills but the correct answer was none of the above those who got rich first turned out to be party members and their families and close associates the question of who should get rich first was no abstraction deng would have understood very well that as the saying goes a waterfront pavilion gets the moonlight first in other words , certain groups would be best positioned to take advantage of the new opportunities in a post1989 society in which the party s power kept the lid on social dissent , political reform had been strangled , and potentially influential organizations were prohibited from stirring unrest , the prospects for ordinary people who plunged into the sea of business were not bright far from striking riches , they were lucky if they did n't drown consider the vast ranks of peasants who were legally prohibited from moving into cities \( because of household registration requirements , which restrict families from relocating from their home provinces without approval \) or the legions of workers laid off by statecontrolled enterprises as a result of deng s economic reforms the upshot of deng s revolution was that those with significant power got significantly rich , those with modest power got modestly rich , and those with no power remained in poverty during deng s southern tour , he coined his most famous catchphrase it does n't matter if a cat is black or white as long as it catches mice , it is a good cat deng s endorsement of market economics stirred a tide of business activity that swept across china and far beyond its shores china s sea of business was distinctive because the party controlled everything effectively , it operated a great number of shoals that those afloat on the sea had to navigate beneath the surface were dangerous waves in these rough seas , if you do n't pay for the right to do business , then you are likely to encounter interference from party officials stateowned enterprises also make doing business difficult chinese officials have a real talent for giving people a hard time in the story of china s rise , the unsung heroes are deng s good cats whom should they pay \? in the abstract , party authority , and specifically , party officials from the former politburo standing committee member zhou yongkang all the way down to county and village cadres subterranean streams of the market economy that had been buried for decades broke forth little by little and flooded the socialist dikes the market economy was incorporated into the partystate , along the way losing the characteristics of truly free choice and competition instead the market worked compliantly for the good of the party highups from venture capital to initial public offerings , from signing contracts to quality inspections , this was the way things were done no exceptions party officials are the body of the party the new economic order means paying for the services of this body entrepreneurs join officials to push up gdp this is not only a good solution for businesspeople , but it also gives officials opportunities to notch up career achievements in a broader sense , it drives the development of the partystate this system of market distortion wrecks livelihoods , wastes natural resources , destroys the environment and threatens calamity for future generations but political priorities require that such collateral damage be forgotten these priorities are expressed by slogans like remember the big picture , pay attention to the whole situation , smaller principles should be sacrificed to larger ones and main priorities trump lower ones rather than admit that they are doing what economists call rentseeking extracting a share of the wealth for themselves , rather than creating wealth officials would prefer to imagine that they are faithful to the party line of doing big things in china , if you want to do big things , you need to buy plenty of backup how high an official you must pay rent to depends on whether you plan to make an impact at the village , county , provincial or even national level party officials at even the lowest levels can determine who within their domain will succeed and prosper once his interests are secured , an official becomes a major stockholder who can be relied on for green lights so long as he gains , it s irrelevant whether a venture helps or hurts the public its owner can be assured the official will channel positive energy to clear obstacles such an arrangement may do nothing to protect the environment , satisfy domestic needs or bolster public integrity , but it will no doubt drive up gdp it s been more than 65 years since china has had any form of democracy the legitimacy of the partystate today rests on statistics about economic growth for officials , there is no more brilliant evidence of achievement corruption and development rise together mao zedong turned private property into state property deng xiaoping transferred national assets , at generous and largely symbolic prices , to party elites as a result today s princelings the descendants of the party s founding revolutionary generation control much of china s wealth these events were noticed by the public , but the party rank and file largely stayed silent they understood what was happening , and knew they had no choice but to enact this policy this was the purpose of the southern tour , to ensure stability throughout the party as the new line was implemented on june 4 , 1989 , deng ordered the people s liberation army to forcibly suppress large numbers of peaceful volunteers in tiananmen square and in cities across china who were calling for an end to corruption and to an accelerated pace of reform the trauma of june 4 was a sea change in a situation in which no one dares speaks out , everyone loses their right to speak , everyone loses the right to shape reform , and everyone can be pushed around one result was that the aim of reform in the 1980s was radically subverted the partyled economic liberalization was supposed to unchain both workers and business owners , unleash their energies and permit profitmaking and profitsharing but after the sea change of 1989 , profits and resources were distributed according to power deng , through his actions on june 4 , drew new demarcation lines to define enemies the party would protect corruption , and anyone who opposed partysupported corruption was a deadly foe of both the party and the army following the 18th party congress , the movement to slay tigers and swat flies struck china like a series of thunderbolts the anticorruption crackdown seems like an epochal event , but perhaps its greatest usefulness has been in opening people s eyes china s red flag , dyed in the blood of martyrs , has become a shelter for evil people and practices the legions of corrupt officials exposed may be only the tip of the iceberg , but these revelations have already eclipsed other reported instances of corruption in china or abroad there is no longer any way of concealing this toptobottom corruption , no chance of erasing knowledge of it from people s minds but while the party s fight against corruption is presented as a public service , if independent citizens members of civil society take up the cause , it is a crime popular movements to combat corruption are , as they were in 1989 , sternly repressed china s putupon and bullied citizens are denied legal redress , through the court system or petitions to the central government indeed , people who have exposed corruption have found themselves put on trial or in prison universal values like transparency and accountability are smeared as tools of overseas enemies causing trouble meanwhile the limitless power of the party to meddle has only increased , as it coopts concepts like the rule of law , technology and globalization does the partystate have the heart to truly fight corruption , even to the point of risking the destruction of the party \? as many have said , only the top tier of leaders really knows i want to say two things first , as long as china travels on the road charted by deng xiaoping , it will not fundamentally end corruption slaying tigers and swatting flies is not a rootandbranch cure it ca n't even alleviate the worst symptoms tigers roam wild , and flies cover the sun you can attack 100 or 1 , 000 of them , and it wo n't change the essential fact of a corrupt road but i remain an optimist , because if chinese leaders are willing to abandon the deng xiaoping road , then there is hope second , the june 4 anniversary is here again many people long for the party leadership to voluntarily admit the injustice and illegality of the killings this is also my hope but i am not optimistic , because so far there have not been many signs to suggest that this will happen as for whether it might be possible one day , down the road , this i ca n't say
roanoke , va on friday , david bowers , the democratic mayor of roanoke , apologized for comments in which he called for halting the resettlement of syrian refugees and suggested that our situation was similar to the one franklin d roosevelt faced when he imprisoned japaneseamericans the mayor did n't have much choice after his remarks earlier this week , hillary clinton s campaign promptly kicked him off her virginia leadership team area progressives are now praying that his bad press has n't killed the city s attempt to persuade the oregonbased deschutes brewery to choose roanoke over our regional rival asheville , nc , for a planned expansion in the wake of islamic state , beirut and elsewhere , i understand fears about terrorists making their way across porous borders but refugees are not terrorists , and if anyone knows this , it should be the mayor of roanoke having spent more than a dozen years chronicling roanoke s immigrant communities , i'm here to tell the mayor learn more about the complexity of the people you represent , and not just for the sake of attracting a brewery roanoke is a small city of around 100 , 000 people , but it has welcomed upward of 7 , 000 refugees over the past 40 years , beginning with refugees from vietnam , and more recently from countries as diverse as myanmar , cuba , burundi , bosnia and somalia in the winter of 2004 , i watched somali bantu , part of a group of around 200 who would eventually settle here , deplane on the frosty airport tarmac , some in hijabs , some in bare feet stamped on their clothing were the letters usrp for the united states refugee program there had been a small backlash when our region s refugee resettlement office announced their arrival a letter to the roanoke times predicted a plague of increased welfare debts , crime , racial disharmony among residents there were whispered fears about potential terrorists in our midst more than a decade later , none of that has come to pass today , roanoke s biggest festival is a celebration of diversity called local colors pearl fu , the chinese immigrant who spearheaded its creation , is known for greeting every foreignborn stranger she sees at the grocery store with , hi , where you from \?

east rutherford , nj deron williams s mercurial postseason took another hairpin turn sunday when his teammate joe johnson let slip that williams might be playing with severe tendinitis johnson was not clear about where the tendinitis was located , although williams has worn a brace on his right knee throughout the season a nets spokesman declined to comment on johnson s diagnosis , saying only that williams had been healthy enough to play johnson had been asked whether he thought criticism of williams s play this series against the atlanta hawks was fair after coach lionel hollins delivered an impassioned defense of williams , a veteran point guard who has scored 5 points in the last two games johnson indicated that williams had been playing through previously undisclosed pain tendinitis has pretty much been my kryptonite , and i know he has a severe case of that , johnson said it s tough , man it s tough but we all have his back , and whatever we have to do , we have to do it williams s status for game 4 on monday at barclays center was already in some doubt williams had suffered injuries to his tailbone and his right leg in , the nets' first of the series after two losses he sat for the final 16 minutes of the game , during which time the nets came from behind to win , 9183 , williams missed an open 15foot jumper that would have tied the game with just over 10 seconds left he finished the game with 2 points on 1of7 shooting and is shooting 269 percent from the field in the series hollins , however , credited the other things williams has done to generate offense , like his 7 rebounds , 53 assists and 13 steals per game after being asked about williams s health for game 4 , hollins detoured into an impromptu defense of his performance deron has played well , hollins said would he like to shoot better \? yes would we like him to shoot better \? yes but he s played extremely well he s gotten us off to great starts with his pace , he s made passes when you 're getting seven to eight assists and eight to 10 rebounds , you 're doing a lot of stuff right hollins added that he felt the news media s portrayal of williams had been totally unfair it s not just about the scoring , hollins said it s about winning it s about doing the right things for the team and i 'll defend deron to the end on that hollins said he did not expect to make any changes to the starting lineup for game 4 unless williams was unable to suit up he said he was banged up pretty good williams was not made available to comment the rest of the nets are feeling revived after they avoided falling behind by three games to none in a tightly contested series against the hawks , the no 1 seed in the eastern conference sunday s practice was light and spirits seemed equally buoyant after the nets closed out saturday s game on an 180 run it was the team s first win in seven tries against the hawks this season we have n't been paying any attention to the seeding , center brook lopez said we feel we 've been very competitive in the series while lopez said momentum had switched to the nets' side , hollins tried to keep the team s emotions subdued the playoffs are an emotional roller coaster , hollins said you lose , everybody s down on you you lose two , everybody s really down on you , thinks that the season s over then you win and , oh , maybe they have a chance you have to avoid being in that mindset and stay evenkeeled one of the key difference saturday was the nets moved the ball well and made big shots early in the game , contributing a 3116 first quarter lead , after the nets had trailed by double figures early in the previous two games it allowed them to work their offense from insideout and it gave atlanta something it could be wary about monday night we 'd been shrinking the court and trying to play in close quarters it had n't really been working out too well for us , forward thaddeus young said last game , we spaced it out well and guys were in the spots they needed to be

riyadh , saudi arabia prince mohammed bin nayef , the interior minister of , arrived at a meeting of security chiefs from across the arab world in marrakesh , morocco , last march to deliver a call to arms it was time , he declared , for a concerted effort to eradicate the muslim brotherhood , according to two arab officials briefed on the meeting several were stunned at his audacity brotherhoodstyle islamists are an accepted part of politics in much of the arab world , including tunisia , libya , jordan , kuwait , bahrain and morocco itself , to say nothing of their warm welcome in qatar , said the officials , who spoke on the condition of anonymity so as not to anger the powerful saudi prince but this toughness toward perceived enemies to his family s dynasty is characteristic of prince mohammed , a central player in the often opaque leadership of the kingdom who was named last week as deputy crown prince , making him second in line to the throne analysts and diplomats who know him say prince mohammed embodies saudi arabia s shift to a more assertive foreign policy , propping up allies and dismantling perceived foes inside the kingdom , he has been a driving force in defeating extremist networks and in stifling and punishing political dissent as world dignitaries including president obama fly here this week to congratulate the new monarch , king salman , it is prince mohammed s appointment to deputy crown prince that has captured attention across the middle east analysts and diplomats say his elevation is a harbinger of the saudi leadership s longerterm vision for their state and the region , but it also raises thorny questions about royal politics among the hundreds of princes who may feel passed over prince mohammed s rise in prominence comes amid newly tense relations between riyadh and washington , and while his focus on counterterrorism is in line with the white house s , it is uncertain that he would be any less hostile to the continuing negotiations between washington and iran over its , or to signals that the white house is no longer pushing for the ouster of syria s president , bashar alassad at the same time , prince mohammed s securityfirst approach to preserving stability and silencing political opposition has been criticized by human rights groups and has often been cited as a motivation by those who support radical islamist groups as interior minister , prince mohammed oversees a range of internal security forces protects vital oil infrastructure and commands a domestic intelligence network that keeps him informed about the secrets of the kingdom he has also played a critical security role in almost every sensitive saudi international file as well , including dealing with bahrain , qatar , syria , iraq , yemen and the  prince mohammed works closely with american intelligence and has such close ties to the white house that he has met twice , in washington and riyadh , with mr obama he is the strongest prince , said bernard haykel , a professor at princeton university who studies saudi arabia he is the most powerful guy in the system he is the pivot as a younger half brother of king abdullah , who died last week , king salman , 79 , has been next in line for the throne for years and like those two men , the new crown prince , muqrin , 69 , is also a son of saudi arabia s founder but prince mohammed , 55 , is the first of the founder s grandsons to be named as an heir to the throne , and his coronation would make him the first of his generation to lead the kingdom many took his appointment as an attempt to underscore the dynasty s stability , laying out its rulers for decades to come they have told the people of saudi arabia that everything is going to be stable for the next 30 years , so do n't worry about the transition , said james b smith , a former united states ambassador to riyadh and it is a strategic message to everyone else who wants to try to secondguess the whole transition idea prince mohammed , moreover , has only daughters , so he is not perceived to have a personal interest in positioning specific heirs to succeed him it means he is a player for the system , who cares about the family as a whole more than he does about himself , professor haykel said but unlike the older generation , made up of a few dozen men , prince mohammed s cohort has an estimated 600 princes , and some analysts suggest that his selection could anger cousins or even uncles who were not chosen it sets into motion some very strange family dynamics , none of which appear very good , said michael stephens , a researcher at the royal united services institute who studies saudi arabia while either of the next two kings could technically name someone else as a successor , many who know prince mohammed say he has stood out for his hard work and integrity whenever a security officer is killed in the kingdom , he is known to pay his respects to the family in person , said mustafa alani , a scholar at the gulf research center and when king abdullah s death was announced , prince mohammed was not in riyadh jockeying for position he was at a counterterrorism conference in london he is the hardestworking person i have ever seen in any government , and i spent a lot of time with him , said mr smith , the former ambassador unlike king abdullah or king salman , who studied at the court , prince mohammed was educated in the west and graduated from lewis clark , a liberal arts college in portland , ore because of his western education , prince mohammed is believed to favor liberalization on matters like education and opportunities for women but he has made few public statements on social issues , and experts say his security mindset makes him unlikely to push for changes that might endanger his family s legitimacy as the guardians of the kingdom s ultraconservative version of islam none of these people are ideological , professor haykel said there is no commitment to anything beyond their interests prince mohammed is a secondgeneration security chief , the son of the former interior minister prince nayef bin abdulaziz as deputy minister under his father , prince mohammed was credited with a leading role helping saudi arabia fend off al qaeda and other islamist militants over the last decade diplomatic cables released by wikileaks portray prince mohammed as personally motivated to fight militant islam and in tight cooperation with the united states in one cable , he said it had been difficult to see that saudis had played role in the sept 11 attacks and other incidents terrorists stole the most valuable things we have , prince mohammed told richard c holbrooke , a former ambassador to the united nations , in 2008 they took our faith and our children and used them to attack us state department officials credit prince mohammed with developing a distinctive approach to combating terrorist recruiting in the kingdom , working directly with the families of dead militants by providing support to the families and telling them their sons had been victims' and not criminals , ' the program gave the families a way out and provided a public relations advantage to the government if you stop five but create 50 , prince mohammed was quoted as saying , that s dumb prince mohammed was also eager to cooperate with the united states in 2009 , he called their law enforcement and intelligence agencies one team and said he had asked the king for permission to maintain a special security channel to exchange information with washington regardless of the ups and downs of bilateral relations but that focus on security has included a broader crackdown on dissent adam coogle , who monitors saudi arabia for human rights watch , said that while law enforcement under prince mohammed s father had often been arbitrary , prince mohammed had professionalized and formalized it the actual outcomes for people are worse , mr coogle said you did this or said that , so you are sentenced to 15 years among the laws used to stifle dissent are a socalled cybercrimes law and a terrorism law implemented last year that allows for the prosecution of acts that undermine the security of the society or endanger its national unity the law gives the interior minister broad powers over detention and has been used to jail many nonviolent dissidents , mr coogle said he is the architect of the crackdown on and jailing of these activists with ludicrously harsh sentences , mr coogle said this is all on his watch still , after a recent attack on members of saudi arabia s shiite minority in its eastern province , prince mohammed flew to the funeral to pay his respects an important gesture for a saudi royal in 2009 , prince mohammed was lightly wounded when a militant who came to his palace saying he wanted reform blew up a bomb hidden in a body cavity though some criticized prince mohammed for letting his guard down , mr alani , of the gulf research center , said that prince mohammed had told his guard not to search the man so as not to humiliate him it showed that this man is not delegating things to his assistants , mr alani said
it s hard to sympathize with the pentagon s plea for more resources to defend our european allies \( , news article , oct 19 \) it s not just that no amount of money will save an organization that burned through trillions of dollars and millions of patriotic young americans only to lose two wars to ragtag insurgencies nor is it just that we already spend more than the other great powers combined , at the expense of domestic needs like infrastructure and education it s that the military lacks imagination more than money the army s commanding general in europe declares that the mission s still the same as during the cold war the mission then was to stop large tank formations from the mighty soviet union and the warsaw pact from conquering west germany none of these even exist today the accompanying photo of paratroopers jumping from a plane could have been taken in world war ii meanwhile , russia has updated its playbook to include cyberwarfare and irregular forces , while the islamic state deploys suicide bombers and social media in the middle ranks of the united states military today are many officers who learned from the illfated missions of the last decade and might help drag the pentagon into the 21st century if given the chance for them , perhaps , 600 billion a year could produce less whining and better results joshua s goldstein amherst , mass
santa rosa , calif five girls wearing makeshift scout uniforms stood before top brass this month and made an announcement we want in i want to be a boy scout , allie westover , 13 , told a panel of men in khaki uniforms weighted by pins and patches she dropped a scout application in front of them then so did her sister , skyler , and three friends ella jacobs , daphne mortenson and taylor alcozer in a year in which gender roles in traditional american institutions have undergone major changes and challenges , a fight in northern california over joining the boy scouts is among the most recent points of contention these girls the latest of many over the decades who have sought to become cub scouts and boy scouts instead of brownies and say they would rather be camping and tying knots than selling cookies and they say shifting attitudes are on their side bathrooms are going unisex in deference to transgender people , the supreme court has redefined marriage to include samesex couples , and even the boy scouts have softened their stance on gay scouts and scout leaders in this liberalminded community , about two hours north of san francisco , a group of girls ages 10 and 13 who have named themselves the unicorns want to formally join the boy scouts , the 105yearold organization that has long considered itself the cradle of american male leadership none of them want to be boys they just want to play like them because we 're girls we ca n't participate with boys \? said ella , 10 when we get into the real world , we 're going to have to work with other people who are , like , not just girls but they face stiff legal obstacles among other factors , , the federal law that prohibits discrimination by sex , carves out an exception for the boy scouts , allowing them to exclude members based on gender indeed , even as the boy scouts have accepted gay members , the organization has guarded its boysonly ethos while allowing girls to participate in some affiliated programs , it keeps them out of the core scouting curriculum that has built a reputation as the most rigorous youth development program in the nation we understand that the values and the lessons of scouting are attractive to the entire family , the national boy scouts organization said in an email to reporters however , cub scouts and boy scouts are yearround programs for boys and young men the unicorns began to consider themselves boy scouts last fall , after they enrolled in a skillsbuilding course , , that is affiliated with the organization and is offered to boys and girls several unicorns had tried the girl scouts but found the experience too sedate rest time and whispering instead of playing tag and lighting fires a spokeswoman for the girl scouts of northern california disagreed with that assessment outdoor experience has really always been a hallmark of what we do , said the spokeswoman , nikki van ausdall if they want to come back to join us , we 're thrilled to have them led by ella s mother , danelle jacobs , 43 , the unicorns moved quickly from the course lessons to more formal boy scout activities earning badges , hiking alongside boy groups and buying uniforms that mimicked those worn by boys in the spring , the unicorns placed second in a major scouting competition called camporee , where they went up against dozens of boy scout groups judged for grit and spirit we can do the same things boys can proven from camporee , ella said in an interview at her home she waved a fistful of ribbons first place in team building , second in backpacking , third in slingshot there s no really girl things' or boy things' her 12yearold brother , evan , said he was very scared the girls would sweep the competition next year but expanding the definition of boy scout is alarming some parents , who voiced concerns about the prospect of shared tents , the erosion of valuable boysonly time and the possibility that girls who already outperform boys in many areas might start to snap up all the leadership positions i have sons , said jennifer masterson , 54 , a scout leader in the same region as the unicorns who said she felt uneasy about the idea of coed scouting would i want a girl sleeping in my son s tent \? no another northern california scout leader , randy huffman , 56 , said he felt similarly uncomfortable maybe their approach should have been to go to the girl scouts and say instead of painting our nails and clipping our whatever they do to do archery and do climbing going through that process this fall , at least one person contacted top boy scout officials to report that the girls here had invaded campouts and competitions on oct 1 , the local boy scout council barred the girls from participating in further activities , telling them that they had gone beyond the lessons permitted in the lifeskills program and that the organization s made it clear that cub scouting , boy scouting and varsity scouting are for boys a meeting was called for nov 13 to help the unicorns understand the decision it was there , at the local boy scout headquarters , that the girls confronted leaders and asked to be made fullfledged boy scouts the response from the men on the panel was swift they would forward the girls' requests to the national office , but said they had no local authority to admit them the rules and regulations , the bylaws , do n't allow that , said rodney mangus , 65 , one of three top officials in the boy scout area that includes santa rosa another official , herb williams , 79 , said he supported the idea of girls in scouting , but only with approval from above without process , without rules and regulation , there s chaos , he said allie , one of the unicorns , responded after the meeting i 'd like to see them standing up like they did for the gay scouts and the gay leaders she noted that several of the officials had been early supporters of gay people in scouting the unicorns are hardly the first girls to try to join the boy scouts of texas and of oregon tried in the 1970s of oklahoma tried in the 1980s and , and from california tried in the 1990s none could persuade boy scout officials to approve their membership the conflict about admitting girls goes back even further than the conflict over admitting gays , said richard ellis , a professor of politics at willamette university in salem , ore , and the author of the book judging the boy scouts of america the conflict in california coincides with a trend of declining membership in the boy scouts for at least a decade about 24 million boys participated in boy scout activities , down from 26 million the year before , and some in santa rosa cited girl recruitment as a possible solution those programs have all been written for squirrelly little boys that run around and get crazy , said mr mangus , the local boy scout official , adding that he thought the curriculum would need to be rewritten if girls were admitted at the same time , mr mangus said , the boy scouts are not daft about what s happening in society as far as admitting girls in the future , he said , who knows \?
albuquerque once an integral part of the s rise to power under gov susana martinez s stewardship in this democratic stronghold , the secretary of state , dianna duran , has now been abandoned by her party , by her political opponents and by one of the state s leading newspapers ms duran is facing accused of misusing campaign money to cover gambling and other personal expenses , one of several scandals to have rocked new mexico politics this summer for democrats , ms duran s fall from grace caps a string of scandals that have offered a chance to regain lost ground ahead of next year s elections they include the hiring of a man of child sexual assault as deputy schools superintendent in albuquerque and over potential abuse of power by a senior state executive the goal , leaders said , is to taint the narrative of ms martinez , the nation s first female hispanic governor , as a toughoncrime leader who campaigned on cleaning up politics and is often mentioned as a for a party struggling to improve its image with hispanic voters though she must leave office at the beginning of 2019 because she is limited to two consecutive terms , ms martinez has drawn votes from both sides of the aisle and helped her party make significant gains she will lead the republican governors association in november , elevating her profile just as presidential politics heat up state democrats are concerned that her popularity will help republican candidates , even if she is not on the ballot the governor should step up and face the serious cases of corruption that have occurred under her watch , said the state s chairwoman , deb haaland , although none of the recent cases have been proved in court each time the governor slings mud in the face of real issues , she loses credibility new mexicans deserve better republican officials dismissed the democrats' attacks as a desperate attempt from a party struggling to retain its relevance unlike her political opponents , governor martinez respects the intelligence of new mexicans and understands that they see through baseless attacks , said her spokesman , chris sanchez democrats in the house of representatives last year for the first time since 1954 , a defeat attributed to a wellliked republican governor , a national environment favorable to conservative politics and dismal turnout they maintain a 24to18 majority in the senate , though its seats were not at play in the last elections , as they will be in 2016 if they now choose to make this election about ethics , said pat garrett , spokesman for the state s , we welcome the opportunity new mexico has weathered its share of scandals a former state senate leader for taking kickbacks while in office , two former state treasurers were imprisoned for pocketing taxpayers' money , and a former secretary of state was indicted on charges of fraud and moneylaundering they were all democrats time and again , the governor and her close advisers have pointed to investments made during the administration of her democratic predecessor , bill richardson , as evidence that democrats cannot be trusted to run the state more recently , they have taken aim at the democratic state auditor , tim keller , questioning his use of a private email account after taking office , a practice in which ms martinez and top officials in her administration also engaged in the past in 2012 , ms martinez allowing judges to strip officials convicted of corruption from their government pensions , then cited the accomplishment in fliers mailed to voters during her reelection campaign she has called the allegations against ms duran deeply troubling and said , it s important that new mexicans understand that no one is above the law and that every new mexican is treated equally under our system political analysts here say , however , that if there is a threat to the unfolding turmoil , it is exactly to the prevailing narrative of her administration and , by association , state republicans as agents of change it runs against their overall theme of cleaning up politics in new mexico , and that can easily become a liability in 2016 , said joe monahan , whose daily blog is one of the state s most closely read political journals brian sanderoff , a pollster here , said that tying all the recent scandals to the governor is a stretch at this point , but that creating the perception of blame may not be as difficult a task it is unlikely that any of her home state s current troubles will have been resolved or forgotten anytime soon ms duran s first court appearance is next tuesday a criminal complaint filed aug 28 by the democratic attorney general , hector balderas , alleged 13 , 000 in illegal transactions , including campaign checks deposited into her personal bank account , from which she withdrew 282 , 000 at eight indian casinos in the state in 2014 more than three times her annual salary of 85 , 000 in an email , ms duran s lawyer , erlinda o johnson , called the charges sensational and misleading and pledged to vigorously fight this selective prosecution by mr balderas , one of the democrats' top picks for the governor s race the other is mr keller , the state auditor early this year , he hired a forensic accounting firm to look into an anonymous complaint received by his office alleging that demesia padilla , ms martinez s appointee as secretary of taxation and revenue , had used her position to pressure employees to give preferential treatment to a taxpayer for whom she had worked as a private accountant in july , mr keller referred the findings to mr balderas , who is reviewing whether they warrant criminal or ethical charges in response , mr sanchez , the governor s spokesman , called mr keller a highly partisan state auditor with a history of playing fast and loose with the facts in order to see his name in the paper in an interview , mr keller said , their attitude is to shoot the messenger a pattern used against anyone who dares criticize her administration , he said i'm fulfilling the obligations of my job he and mr balderas also sent letters to albuquerque public schools officials mr keller raising concerns about complaints by the schools' chief financial officer over the merits of certain contracts and mr balderas bringing up flawed safety protocols that allowed the man facing child sexual assault charges , jason martinez , to get a job in the largest public school system in the state mr martinez \( no relation to the governor \) had not submitted to a background check before his hiring his legal troubles escaped notice until , an online publication , broke the news aug 21 he had resigned a day earlier the schools' chief financial officer , don moya , filed a aug 24 , alleging that the governor and the state s education secretary , hanna skandera , had had a hand in hiring mr martinez earlier , mr moya had received a text message that luis valentino , then the superintendent , had apparently meant to send to ms skandera , saying that he planned to go after mr moya and asking whether she had any ideas mr moya was placed on leave shortly after receiving the message mr garrett , of the state republican party , said the blame for mr martinez s hiring should fall on the democraticdominated school board and mr valentino , the san francisco liberal they appointed as

in the right stuff , tom wolfe writes that the first astronauts' wives were presented as seven flawless cameofaced dolls sitting in the family room with their pageboy bobs in place , ready to offer any and all aid to the brave lads that was the image that nasa created , and that s what an abc series that begins on thursday , seeks to debunk this show applies the mad men formula to the women who stood behind the heroes of the conquest of space it s an amused but gauzy look back at a prefeminist era when women deferred to their husbands , wore gloves to church and took one another potluck dishes like tater tot surprise and jello salad \( gossip girl \) created the astronaut wives club from , a former reporter for the new york times it focuses on the frustrations and hardships that nasa wives , like all military spouses , endured behind the scenes , but this account has more than a tinge of nostalgia for a time that had clear rules and , better yet , a midcentury style that these days is all the rage the series purports to tell the real story behind the publicity machine , but it is so enamored of the early'60s aesthetic that it ca n't resist adding its own flawless , cameofaced gloss to its heroines the astronaut wives club is n't the first network series to romanticize the past while also trying to deconstruct it at the peak of mad men mania in 2011 , nbc came up with and abc had pan am , shows that were both dreamy evocations of a bygone era , before betty friedan and women s lib they idealized the struggle and the indignity of serving men drinks in a bunny costume or in a tight stewardess uniform men made the rules , but women got to work and found female solidarity on this show , the astronauts are held up to the public as demigods , and their wives become known as the first ladies of space , subject to almost as much scrutiny and fascination as president kennedy s wife , jacqueline , who invites some of them to tea at the white house none of the series s seven wives , based on the real women , are as blandly perfect and contented as they appear in the pages of life magazine , which bought exclusive rights to their stories as soon as their husbands were selected to be the first americans in space \( in 1961 , the soviet got there first , which made nasa s goal all the more urgent \) trudy cooper \( odette annable \) , married to gordon cooper \( bret harrison \) , is a pilot herself and was on the verge of divorcing her philandering husband when he got the call she goes along to cape canaveral , fla , for the reflected glory louise shepard \( dominique mcelligott \) has little control over alan shepard \( desmond harrington \) , who seems like an allamerican boy scout but mostly earns badges for seducing groupies clustered around the motel pool marge slayton \( erin cummings \) has secrets in her past that could stunt the career of her husband , deke \( kenneth mitchell \) she was divorced from her first husband and , worse , for a time worked overseas as a single woman as they gather at cape canaveral , the wives are at first wary and competitive on their husbands' behalf , but over time and shared worry , they begin to bond when not in training , the mercury astronauts are on the loose nasa expects the wives to cover up their husbands' peccadilloes , and a reporter for life is on hand at all times , making sure that their behindthescenes tensions , jealousies and fears are whitewashed for an adoring public the characters are likable but surprisingly flimsy they not only look as smooth as their retouched magazine photos , but their personalities also are n't much more complex they have flaws , but they are basically all good women who stand by their brave men and support one another a lifetime series that focused on the ordeals of military spouses raising families while their mates served in iraq and afghanistan , was much more realistic and , surprisingly , given the subject , more fun real excitement in this series is found not in motel rooms or boozy barbecues but inside the command center at nasa , where early launches were terrifying the most intense countdown scenes fade to black and white to echo the news coverage of the time the creators of the astronaut wives club may have wanted to avoid belittling their heroines in a space age version of desperate housewives , but they did them a different disservice by sugarcoating them almost as much as nasa did some 50 years ago
carmen cicero , now in his late 80s , has worked in several styles , none his own , but always with enough panache to establish proprietary claims in the 1950s , he was a promising secondgeneration abstract expressionist who exhibited regularly , pursuing thatches of autonomist lines on paper and canvas , are owned by all new york s major museums a disastrous studio fire in 1971 seems to have turned mr cicero toward his own comical version of neoexpressionism figuration , a vibrant , sometimes visionary style enlivened by vigorous brushwork , radiant color and a sense of high drama the earliest work here is crime from 1976 , which features a blizzard of short rapid brush strokes a kind of parody of abstract expressionism that , with study , reveals a tough guy firing a gun in the viewer s direction it is like an americangangster version of the thicklimbed young men for which the italian artist became known more accomplished is the surprise at the window , from 1981 , in which a ghostly count dracula scares the wits , cigarettes and martinis out of a bunch of soign hollywood silentfilm types standing in a wood cabin or on a stage alive with light and shadow the generally whiteonwhite nightmare \( 1986 \) , which depicts a madman in a frozen landscape dotted with faces has some wonderful moments , while the relatively small man with mask \( 1987 \) contrasts a green hat and a vivid orange mask it is in many ways a perfect painting that some museum should add to its cicero holdings
paterson , nj the combatants agreed to meet in a law office , in one of those ancient brick mills that cast shadows of paterson s flourishing past over its hard streets this beef between up the hill and down the hill had to end , now that another child had died of gunfire a basketball prodigy a boy streetsmart elders had demanded the meeting , so here came teenagers and young adults from both neighborhoods last monday night , slouching in the conference room s redleather chairs , leaning against a wall featuring a portrait of john lennon they quickly squared off like aggrieved litigants the tension between pockets of the these upanddown neighborhoods in paterson , considered one of the most violent small cities in the country , goes so far back that no one remembers how it began but knives had replaced fists , and guns had replaced knives , and now armoni sexton , 15 , a silky 6foot7 player with a shot at a world beyond ,  why this kid \? kenyatta stewart , a lawyer who helped arrange the meeting , said , echoing the question that nagged those in the room why do you pick the most talented , the tallest the kid we all expected to be the next one \? armoni continues to light it up only , an exclamation point in a yellow jersey , dribbling with kevin durant assuredness , twirling his body for layups and dunks , safe in his hardwood home this city of 146 , 000 has a geographical divide in its famously picturesque gorge , and a territorial divide in the decadeslong battles between groups from neighborhoods known as down the hill and up the hill this goes all the way back to hurricane' carter , jerry speziale , the police director , said , referring to in the 1960s while these groups sometimes go by nicknames the 230 boys , the glock boys , the brick squad they are more neighborhood clusters than traditional gangs , speziale said this does not mean they are any less violent a humming heroin trade has taken root at a time when budget cuts have drastically reduced the police presence paterson had two dozen homicides last year , and has had six so far this year , including that of armoni the tribal dispute that killed armoni had no hold on him in life he spent his first years down the hill , then moved up the hill you could always find him on a court somewhere , his allegiance only to the game he joined the elite playaz basketball club , became a standout on the amateur athletic union circuit , and emerged as one of the top players in the country s class of 2018 off the court , armoni could be an attentive older brother , a boy interested in cooking , a competitor willing to accept the challenge of 25 , 50 , 100 pushups to build his body on the court , though , his temper often got him in so much trouble that he was nicknamed live wire this may explain why armoni did n't go to one of the catholic high schools regarded as basketball powerhouses no one wanted to touch the live wire he played , instead , for the paterson charter school for science and technology , whose coach , tommie patterson , had been watching armoni on the court for years like a live wire , patterson said it fit him perfectly to help the boy mature , patterson would have other players subject armoni to shoves and trashtalking then he 'd blow the whistle and say this is what it s going to be like , moni you have to prepare armoni prepared as a freshman last season , he averaged 18 points and 9 rebounds a game , leading his team in one game , against saddle brook , he had 41 points , 10 rebounds , 6 blocked shots and 5 steals he was a talent , but he was also just a kid from paterson he was n't an angel , he was n't an a student , stewart , the lawyermentor , said but he was just like me when armoni was arrested this year for trying to sell drugs , his mother , lawanda sexton , who grew up down the hill , yanked him from paterson charter and sent him to a prep school in north carolina coach patterson was taken aback , in part because there were still several games on the team s schedule but he also understood , since he had already recommended that armoni s mother send him to a prep school why \? because , in the coach s mind , the paterson of his youth , tough but protective of its promising children , no longer existed i started to realize that people did n't care , he said you 're a basketball player \? we do n't care you ai n't nothing , and i ai n't nothing last september , a young basketball player named nazerah bugg was shot to death while walking down a street she was 14 two months earlier , a girl named genesis rincon was killed by gunfire while riding her scooter she was 12 armoni , on probation for that drug case , lasted only a few weeks at the prep school in north carolina he was homesick for paterson , where , those close to him say , he wanted to improve his grades , his dribbling and his academic focus he returned to the basketball courts up and down the hill , to the pushandpull of street temptations and earnest mentors and at around 8 30 on a saturday night in midapril , a halfhour before his curfew , he was killed in a driveby shooting on rosa parks boulevard a shooting the police attribute to that ageold quarrel between two neighborhoods teammates carried his coffin classmates adorned his locker with flowers and a basketball jersey friends posted memorial tributes on youtube , where live wire soars in slow motion toward another dunk lawanda sexton publicly forgave the young man arrested in the shooting , someone known to her family forgiveness is power , she said that still left the animus between up the hill and down the hill , whose representatives gathered now in a law firm s conference room here , among others , were kenyatta stewart , the lawyer , and casey melvin , the barber and community leader , and rahshon dixon , the leader of an antiviolence group called street keepers , all telling them put the guns down and let s end this according to stewart , someone suggested fighting it out in montgomery park then someone else said if we 're going to fight again , it 'll be with guns , so it s over the word went out the next night , a few hundred people from both neighborhoods came together in montgomery park for a party when photographs of the celebration circulated on social media , people in paterson thought the pictures had been manipulated , so improbable was the scene still , those streetwise elders knew that something more formal , and more constructive , had to be done they called another meeting for last thursday night at passaic county community college , and sent the message that the young men from up and down the hill had better show up organizers reserved the first several rows of the auditorium for their guests , both to praise them and to make sure they did n't nod off or lose themselves in their cellphones by the appointed hour of 6 , though , those seats were empty they 're not too excited to be here , said a large man at the door named teddie martinez he did several years in federal prison for drugrelated offenses , he said , but now he and his wife , barbara , run a communityoutreach program called project connect he also helped to broker this tentative peace , which the police say has been aided by their increased presence they want to make sure they 're not being set up , martinez added so they 'll send their leaders down first sure enough , a few wary teenagers soon appeared others then followed to fill more than 50 seats , their faces masks of smoldering boredom they listened as community leaders tried to both scare and encourage them , one minute talking about prison \( who wants to be there \? martinez said stand up \) and the next job opportunities they were given forms and advice about getting proper identification , a high school degree and off the streets after nearly two hours , the meeting ended the young men rose from their seats , none interested in talking much to reporters when asked where he lived , a boy who called himself xavier said up the hill do n't forget it that s important also rising from her seat was a woman with a rueful smile and a tshirt that said , just a kid from paterson her presence had not been acknowledged , but maybe that was because everyone felt it anyway armoni s mother lawanda sexton and the others from up the hill , down the hill and all around filed back out to the streets of paterson , where a truce has been declared and , so far , held now that a boy with a gift for a game is gone
if is selling out , more musicians should do it her way grimes is claire boucher , the canadian songwriter who released her fourth album , art angels , on nov 6 and played a packed terminal 5 on monday night she performed with dancers , puffs of smoke , lasers and a breathlessly gleeful stage presence there was even a fan blowing back her twotoned hair the album cover for art angels , drawn \( like the rest of her graphics \) by ms boucher herself , shows a pointyeared creature with thorns in her neck , a third eye , and next to her , in a comicbooklike burst of yellow , 1000 , 00000 it s a preemptive strike against accusations of selling out grimes is braced for indierock moralizing the increasingly risible notion that once an artist reaches a loyal cult audience of a certain size , any further outreach would only dilute and simplify what the cultists had been discerning enough to appreciate after all , grimes , 27 , emerged not long ago out of an arty left field she is an entirely doityourself songwriter , singer , producer and visual artist with a piping high voice , a fondness for electronic loops and poptinged melodies and lyrics that welcome multiple interpretations her previous albums were lofi and more or less meditative , though each one moved closer to the dance floor visions , in 2012 , made her an indie sensation , with gleaming synthpop songs harboring darker introspection its peppy single , dealt with the aftermath of a sexual assault grimes also generated a matterhorn of subtext and commentary farranging interviews , a presence , and videos and fashion shoots in which she took on countless archetypes she was , a schoolgirl , a scifi alien , a goddess , a makeupsmeared mess for those who were n't just dancing to the songs , grimes was challenging all sorts of assumptions about power , gender , media and pop itself but for all the attention it drew , visions reached only no 98 on the billboard album chart not pop enough grimes was no indie snob she knew her lady gaga , her katy perry , her kpop but they all draw on the expertise of collaborators producers , songwriters , video directors , stylists grimes , astonishingly , enlisted none of them for art angels no max martin or dr luke for her she learned to do everything herself , from producing the huge virtual beats that power top 10 pop to playing violin for her own string parts and , she has said , she discarded an entire album that did n't satisfy her art angels demands to play in the big leagues far from diluting her music , grimes has ramped up its catchiness , its madcap invention and its contentious ideas the album mines pop past and present no doubt , madonna , tom tom club , rihanna and then decisively oneups it on previous albums , grimes was often content to toy with a few loops and beats throughout a song , while , on art angels , hooks , beats , backup choirs and assorted noises keep arriving out of nowhere , each an elaborate new treat grimes has vastly upgraded her rhythms songs on visions sound stiff compared with the quickchanging beat of pin variously rhythm guitar , stopstart drums , vocal syllables , handclaps and video game boops or with the new wave gallop of kill v maim , which in some spots sounds as if it were propelled by stereo gunfire grimes s version of pop does n't require dumbeddown lyrics , either on california , she sings , i get carried away commodifying all the pain her guests on the album are female rappers and singers aristophanes , from taiwan , rapping in mandarin with a cataclysmic view of female sexuality in and janelle mon e , joining grimes on venus fly to mock the objectification of women why you looking at me \? it s the kind of catchy little chant a high school girl might arm herself with to fend off harassment the show at terminal 5 was a smiley , silly pop spectacle , with grimes as a trouper she was fighting the flu , and she had a brace on her right leg recovering from a sprain , but dancing her way from her keyboard platform to center stage as if it were n't there she s making music now that might lead listeners to all the subtext and commentary but does n't require it as it needs to be in the world of radio pop , the sound is enough grimes can scale up
torrance , calif at the height of roger clinton s fame , the struggling rock singer stood accused of taking cash and a gold rolex to lobby for pardons as his half brother bill clinton s presidency was ending fifteen years later , with hillary rodham clinton seeking to navigate a return to the white house , the selfdescribed first brother is keeping a lower profile he lives quietly in this seaside suburb of los angeles with his dog , copper , spending time with his collegeage son and pursuing an idea for a television music talent show yet roger clinton remains largely dependent on his more famous family members a relationship that poses the risk of new , if familiar , headaches \( headache , in fact , was the code name given roger by the secret service during president clinton s two terms \) his own lawyer said last year that roger clinton had no money even the 857 , 000 house he lives in was provided by bill clinton , bought using a limited liability company at a time when roger clinton owed more than 100 , 000 in back taxes , according to interviews and public records more recently , roger clinton parlayed his family ties into a consulting arrangement with a group of builders hoping to sell houses in haiti , where bill clinton s private foundation and mrs clinton s state department helped direct recovery efforts after the 2010 earthquake roger clinton s intended role , previously unreported , was to use his connections to help win approvals , said wayne coleman , a houston businessman involved in the project , which ultimately went nowhere i paid roger 100 , 000 , mr coleman said basically , he promised to get us a contract through the clinton foundation for a project over there what he was really trying to do was sell the influence of his brother a recent visit to his ranchstyle home not far from the beach found roger clinton , 58 , heading out to get an oil change with copper , a big friendly shepherd he said he had gotten from a local police officer a vintage skyblue mustang sat in the driveway , but it did not appear to have been driven in a while he was using a truck parked at the curb standing in his doorway , looking casual in a backward ball cap and college sweatshirt , he was alternately wary and chatty , twice asking if the interview was being recorded it was not while expounding on the challenges of living in the shadow of the man he calls big brother i do n't have a choice of being first brother , mr clinton said it s not like i 've been given the option of doing it and i could turn it down there are times when it s hard he said his family connections work against him seven out of 10 times , and he cited the haiti project as an example he suggested that advisers and lawyers around the former president had kept it from being approved , even though big brother loved it you had all this government grant money , and all this money bill was raising from around the world for reconstruction , he said but we just could n't make it happen it s like , come on , man , ca n't you just throw me a bone \? roger is not the only member of the clinton extended family to have attracted unwanted attention mrs clinton s brothers , tony and hugh rodham , also surfaced in various attempts to obtain pardons from the clinton white house and , in the case of tony , an unsuccessful bid for his own housing deal in haiti through the clinton foundation representatives of the clintons declined to answer written questions for this article lanny davis , a special counsel in the clinton white house who sometimes speaks for the family , issued a statement saying the brothers live their own lives and expressing hope that their desire for privacy is understood by both the republicans and the media in the 1990s , roger clinton chased the limelight as an aspiring singer with a rock band called politics and in movies like pumpkin head ii and spy hard but he was known as much for his prison stint for a 1985 cocaine conviction as for his artistic talents , viewed as something of a sideshow , popping up and singing in north korea congressional investigators in 2001 found that he had tried to cash in on his white house connections , consulting contracts and money from unexplained foreign sources house republicans , whose final report on the pardon inquiry accused him of serious and reckless misconduct , expressed frustration that reaction seemed muted by generally low expectations for his behavior today , he is mostly off the public radar if also coping with the occasional tabloid cameo , as when he was sued , unsuccessfully , over fights between women at his home it is unclear exactly how he supports himself , although bill clinton appears to play an important role when bill clinton was an adviser and partner in some of ronald w burkle s yucaipa investment funds in the mid2000s , roger clinton occasionally appeared at yucaipa offices to pick up a check , a former yucaipa employee said an adult daughter of roger clinton said bill clinton paid for her cosmetology schooling in tennessee in recent years and a lawyer defending roger clinton in a lawsuit in december floated the possibility that the former president could help with a settlement , according to emails related to the case that were reviewed by the new york times the lawyer , walter wiggins jr , said in one of those emails that his client has no money himself , but he might be able to borrow some from his brother if the situation warrants it the plaintiff , nadeze connelly , maintained that roger clinton was liable for an assault on her by another woman at his home in 2011 no settlement occurred , and ms connelly lost in court mr wiggins , who has represented roger clinton in various legal matters for at least a dozen years , declined to comment bill clinton s role in providing his brother with a house is not readily apparent from the public record , which shows that the property was bought in june 2009 for 857 , 000 by calle mayor llc but the limited liability company shares a postal box with bill and hillary clinton where they live in chappaqua , ny and the company s contact person is justin cooper , who was a longtime aide to the former president \( separately , mr cooper s name surfaced recently with the disclosure of mrs clinton s home email server records showed he was listed as the contact for the domain registration \) the house was bought during the early part of mrs clinton s tenure as secretary of state she did not cite it specifically on her financial disclosure reports , but listed an unidentified parcel of california real estate owned by her husband her 2012 filing indicated the property was transferred to an undisclosed party on christmas eve that year , and it does not show up at all in her most recent filing , for 2014 on the public record , calle mayor llc continues to hold the property , but changes to the company s ownership structure would not need to be disclosed further muddying the ownership picture were comments roger clinton made in the interview asked about bill clinton s purchase of the house , he said he shared ownership of it 5050 with big brother i put 50 percent of the money into it , roger clinton said he did not elaborate on when he had bought a share or where he had obtained the money to do so depending on the circumstances , such a purchase could have been problematic because of his tax debts , according to tax lawyers when calle mayor bought the house in 2009 , the internal revenue service had a lien on all of roger clinton s assets because of 57 , 762 in unpaid taxes , and california had a lien for 57 , 827 , laying claim to property now owned or later acquired by him the liens were lifted in 2010 and 2011 david holtz , a former irs litigator in los angeles , said it could be considered tax evasion if someone concealed ownership of property with the intent of not paying a tax debt on the other hand , he said , if the debtor was in a repayment plan and not trying to be deceptive , or if someone else bought the house and let the debtor live there , that would be no problem at all if i was still working at the irs and someone came to me with this , it would raise eyebrows and trigger me to dig further to find out what exactly was going on , mr holtz said a person familiar with the clinton family said the former president decided to make the purchase to help provide a stable living environment for roger clinton and his son , who was a teenager at the time the use of a limited liability company was to provide some financial protection for the former president , as he was not going to be living in the home , according to this person , who requested anonymity to speak about private matters involving the family roger clinton did come into some money over the next couple of years , after he was approached about helping the houston builders win a haiti reconstruction contract mr coleman , one of the builders , said a mutual friend had introduced them to roger , who kept assuring us he could get something done the builders , whose proposal was called living modular and involved lowcost concrete homes for haitians displaced by the earthquake , paid roger clinton 5 , 000 a month , mr coleman said theirs was one of many in an expo in haiti that showcased various housing plans mr coleman said bill clinton had toured the builders' demonstration home , along with others , none of which were chosen in the end mr coleman said mr wiggins , roger clinton s lawyer , had gotten involved in the effort as well , giving the builders hope the project might move forward , to no avail he was basically trying to help roger , because roger was kind of a screwball , you could never pin him down on anything , he said i probably lost about half a million dollars over all on the whole thing roger clinton acknowledged that his former partners might be feeling a little burned , but he said he had spent thousands of dollars of his own money as well and tried his best he said his decision to get involved with a project that his brother could have some sway over was completely above board i do n't usually do it , but this time i really felt like i could do some good , he said would i have made money out of it \? sure , at least i hoped so i could have kept half and given half to charity i could be a philanthropist , too
washington representative mimi walters of california is the freshman class envoy to the republican house leadership team , and she is the only republican woman from her state in the house so it is no surprise that she is already attracting attention a former mayor of laguna niguel , calif , and a state legislator , ms walters arrived in congress from california s 45th district ready to learn one of the best tips so far came from representative susan w brooks , republican of indiana women can wear their congressional pin on a chain as a necklace ms walters , 52 , showed off the pin during an interview , which has been condensed below listen , this thing took me 18 years to get , she said , referring to her career in elected office , and it s the most expensive piece of jewelry i own you are the mother of four children between the ages of 18 and 22 how did that prepare you for the rigors of congress \? i'm used to solving lots of conflicts , and i actually think that that experience being a mom , especially with kids so close in age has prepared me for this job , because there s so many competing interests and you have to oftentimes find resolutions to disagreements the 2010 class was the class in broad strokes , what do you think is the goal and tone of the freshman class of the 114th congress \? this freshman class wants to get things done and is very solutionoriented and so far i can tell that we 're really working well together , and we want to move our agenda forward any key issues \? i think unanimously we 're all very concerned about jobs and making sure that we create more jobs for people in america you have said you would like to be a mentor to other women what advice do you give women considering a run for office , who are balancing the demands of parenting and family \? it is a big demand and i think what women need is just the confidence that they can do it and one of the ways they 'll get the confidence they can do it is that they see other women doing it i mean , i 've had to juggle my four kids i have a husband i still run the house i pay all the bills none of that has changed being 3 , 000 miles away my husband is very supportive and very helpful , but ultimately , i have always felt that that has been my responsibility and , you know , we make it work recently , women in the republican conference helped on a 20week ban on abortions because they felt it did not do enough to accommodate victims of rape what concerns , if any , did you raise behind the scenes \? i did have a concern about the language , and many of the members of the freshman class came to me men and women , voicing their concern and being at the leadership table , i was able to voice the concern to the leaders you are from california when it comes to immigration , what in your ideal world would you like to see happen \? we need immigration reform , there s no question , but we need congress to make the reforms and put them into law we need to secure the border we need to decide what we 're going to do with the 11 million people that are in this country we need a guest worker program agriculture very badly needs this problem resolved does your comprehensive plan at some point include some form of legal status for the 11 million immigrants already here illegally \? i would support a pathway to legalization for those 11 million that are here , but you have to remember that people have gone through this process already , and we should not be putting those people ahead of the people that have gone through the process another issue we have to deal with are people who are here on expired visas we need to have reform when it comes to our visas you have described yourself a practical conservative what does that mean \? i have a philosophy of limited government and accountability , and i believe that people should keep more of their money when they work hard , and not have government take their money from them , because i think people can spend their money more wisely but i'm also very practical that government s job is to sometimes help those people who need help not to give them money to just give them money , but to give them tools to help bring them out of poverty and sometimes we have to make decisions that i'm not necessarily going to agree with everything in a piece of legislation , but i 'll take 80 percent i do n't have to be 100 percent purist you come to congress with a lot of local political experience but what has surprised you most about congress so far \? the pace here is pretty fast i mean , i was busy in the state senate , but i'm really busy here , and just being new , trying to learn my way around has been a challenge i think a challenge for everybody but i love it it s an honor did you get any good tips from female members \? i know it can be hard just with the shoes , walking on the marble all day i will not wear high heels two days in a row i now have brought many flats back from california here , because it s just too difficult i 've fallen down twice already , and it s a little embarrassing i did n't expect i 'd be having to walk as much but it s great , because you get to stay in shape
this weekend the will show a lot of love to someone who s famous for loving only himself narcissus according to greek mythology , this gorgeous youth was so enamored of his reflection in a pond that

march 4 , 1865 , is remembered as the day of abraham lincoln s second inaugural address , but it was also a moment that has been forgotten in the long history of slave emancipation in america as lincoln spoke of malice toward none , almost 100 , 000 slaves went free in states loyal to the union all were women and children , emancipated by an act of congress designed to encourage enlistments by black men in the union army this wartime liberation has disappeared from public memory but it was a turning point in the downfall of american slavery in which slaves played a leading part in transforming the civil war into a war for abolition the enlistment act reached beyond the emancipation proclamation , which applied only to areas in rebellion by declaring forever free the black soldier s wife and children , the act brought liberation to slaves owned by loyal masters in the border states human property that lincoln had pledged the civil war would leave untouched by 1865 , saving the union had become inseparable from destroying slavery but men still enslaved in the border states refused to wage war for the union unless , in exchange , they won their families freedom as well as their own the enlistment act was revolutionary in a world in flux , where constitutional change flowed from the tides of war , it based abolition on slave marriage it assumed precisely what slavery denied the right of chattel property to marry and have a family and , for the first time , congress stripped loyal slaveholders of property without compensation , a challenge to the takings clause of the fifth amendment for nearly a year , congress had debated two abolition decrees one became the 13th amendment the other was the enlistment measure the amendment altered the fundamental law enshrined in the constitution the enlistment measure created a soldier s quid pro quo under the war power of congress but both broke the bonds of slavery , converting chattel property into free persons the enlistment act took effect while the amendment was still awaiting ratification by the states which was as antislavery statesmen intended the country cannot wait the slow action of a constitutional amendment , argued senator charles sumner of massachusetts all must confess the humanity of the proposition to enfranchise the families of the colored persons who have borne arms for their country but slaveholding statesmen saw it differently the enlistment legislation was utterly to disregard the constitution , argued senator garrett davis of kentucky , a crusade against slavery as unjust , as fanatical , and as irrational as all the other crusades that have heretofore taken place in the world at the heart of the constitutional debate lay the perplexity of freeing a slave wife bound to both a loyal master and a union soldier of basing abolition on the legal fiction of slave marriage , since slaves had no right to make contracts some legislators doubted the possibility of proving which union soldier has a wife , or how many wives he has others spoke of loyal masters deserving a fair price for slaves , five hundred apiece ultimately , congress refused to purchase the slave wife s liberty , denying that just compensation under the fifth amendment applied to ending the ownership of human beings and at the heart of the revolutionary law lay the aspirations of slaves the question of who freed the slaves is a longstanding one whether it was lincoln , or congress , or union generals or fugitives who fled from masters yet it is clear that the enlistment act originated in claims pressed by slaves appeals for congressional abolition came to the capitol from across the border states , emerging from plantations and army camps and from deep within slave households letters from slave wives described home life to their husbands away at war , letters relayed to antislavery statesmen who read the words aloud in congress the accounts told of soldiers wives beaten scandalously and left almost naked by slaveholders allegedly loyal to the union as one slave wife wrote i cannot ask any of our neighbors to enlist and have them suffer as i am suffering the slave women s torment drew soldiers back to plantations , to call for abolition instead of returning to battle their military affidavits told of wives unmercifully whipped and awfully abused , grievances that led union generals to press congress to enact immediate emancipation by virtue of the enlistment measure i have a wife , a black soldier named george washington wrote directly to lincoln , explaining she had a hard master he pleaded for a dis charge , but also asked if you will free me and hir today , on the sesquicentennial of the second inaugural , it is worth remembering not only how lincoln justified the civil war as a divine retribution for slavery , but how slaves inscribed their will in the forgotten enlistment act the president spoke of the war lasting until every drop of blood drawn with the lash shall be paid by another drawn with the sword meanwhile , bondswomen impatient for freedom found deliverance as wives of union soldiers instead of waiting for the 13th amendment follow disunion at or join us  amy dru stanley , a professor of history at the university of the chicago , is currently a fellow at the princeton university center for human values

syracuse , sicily by now , the unceasing tides of migrants arriving at the ports of sicily fall into loose national categories the syrians usually arrive with money , bearing broken lives in canvas bags , and are able to slip out of , bound for affluent northern europe the eritreans may be far less wealthy but they too are well organized , with networks that move them north as well then there are men like agyemin boateng and prince adawiah , who were scooped out of the mediterranean this month by an italian rescue ship both are from ghana , and neither has a plan for a new life in europe nor , they say , did either of them ever plan to come to italy they were working as laborers in , until life there became untenable and returning to ghana became unfeasible there are guns and bombs , said mr adawiah , 25 , who worked in tripoli for nearly three years every day , there is shooting i'm afraid that is why i traveled to italy escalated sharply in april , with the coming of warmer weather to the mediterranean many more smugglers' boats took to the sea , and a record number of migrants died attempting the crossing more than 1 , 700 people so far in 2015 , by some estimates conflicts in africa , the middle east and central asia have shaped and reshaped europe s migrant flows in recent years , with none more transformative to the mediterranean smuggling trade than the civil war in syria and the tumult in is changing the migration equation once again libyan lawlessness has allowed a haven for smugglers to operate along the country s coastline , but it has also unmoored many african laborers who were working there as migrants many of these men now languish in italian detention centers without contacts or plans for the future , and their growing numbers are frustrating some italian mayors and other officials we do n't know anything , said one migrant , shamsudeen sawud , 18 , who arrived in italy more than a week ago no one is telling us anything migration statistics offer a hint of the shift more than 170 , 000 migrants and refugees arrived in italy by sea last year syrians and eritreans were the two largest groups among them , accounting for more than 76 , 000 people , according to italy s interior ministry gambians ranked a distant fifth yet during the first quarter of 2015 , a relatively slow period with just 10 , 165 arrivals was the leading country of origin , accounting for 1 , 413 of the migrants the authorities have not published figures for april yet , but humanitarian and migration groups confirm that a majority of the arriving migrants came originally from subsaharan african countries some directly , with italy as a destination , but many end up here less deliberately we see that even people who had originally moved to libya with the intention to remain there including both refugees and migrants have now decided to flee toward europe , even though it means risking their lives in a very dangerous journey at sea , matteo de bellis , the italy representative for amnesty international , said in an email bruce leimsidor , an expert on europe s asylum system , said a certain amount of skepticism should be applied , because migrants may make such claims in the hope that it will help their requests for asylum in europe before the fall of the qaddafi government , mr leimsidor said , hundreds of thousands of west africans , as well as many bangladeshis , worked in libya to save money for an eventual return home , and never planned to move on to europe , but the situation is very different now it has been several years now that work in libya for the migrants has been quite scarce , mr leimsidor , who at ca' foscari university in venice , said in an email given that scarcity and the dangers of violence in the country , he said , those who have come into libya in the last few years have had at least some intention of coming to europe at the umberto i detention center in this ancient sicilian port city , mohammed njie , 31 , described his route to italy he left his home in gambia seven months ago after a dispute with his boss over unpaid wages he made his way to libya , hoping to send money back to his parents and two children , following in the footsteps of older generations of gambians who worked in libya and returned home with nest eggs they could buy homes , buy a car , he said they could live a better life now , though , mr njie and other african migrants at the detention center said there was rampant abuse in libya some men said the construction bosses had stopped paying wages to laborers , and other men who did get their pay said they were preyed upon by criminal gangs , including marauding teenagers who robbed people at gunpoint they know you ca n't send money back to ghana , said mr adawiah , who had worked in libya since 2012 there are no banks that is why they know that money is with you that is why they attacked us every day mr boateng said trying to go home from libya would be perilous because militias and criminals now infest the land routes he said one ghanaian man who worked in libya for three years was robbed of all his savings while trying to make his way home it is difficult to go back to your country , even if you have money , mr boateng said when they see you are black , they know you have money on you several men said that sympathetic libyans had put them in touch with smugglers as a means of saving their lives , even as the smugglers were actively seeking black laborers to make the trip they say , if you want to save your life , leave , and we will take you to italy , ' mr adawiah said of the smugglers the growing population of migrants in italy is becoming a political controversy a group of italian mayors recently tried to block plans by the national government to distribute migrants to detention centers around the country italy has also been criticized for allowing many syrians and eritreans to pass through and apply for asylum in northern europe , a violation of policy at the umberto i center , many of the migrants expressed dismay and uncertainty not one had a cellphone or had been able to contact relatives in

london politics is serious business , so it comes as a delightful surprise that a play about a community of south londoners casting their ballots should prove the most fiendishly funny evening in town that donmar warehouse s limited run of the vote will also be history as of friday is part of the point of a selfdescribed play for theater and television from the inspired team of the writer james graham and the director josie rourke , and with a bustling cast that includes judi dench their collaboration last year on privacy at the same theater pushed the boundaries in its own way asking audiences , for instance , to turn on their cellphones as part of a larger inquiry into the interface between the individual and technology the vote is less structurally audacious , though any theater piece with a cast of more than 40 represents a brave endeavor in both financial and organizational terms one wonders in passing how the bijou donmar accommodates all these people in the wings but what mr graham has done here is apply the madcap energy of , say , a kaufman and hart comedy from the 1930s to a consideration of the democratic process in the 90 minutes before the polls close the conceptual fillip is that thursday s final performance will be broadcast live in britain on the more4 channel , which means that britons fresh from ticking boxes in real life can tune in to watch the cast make their own fictional choices from a lineup that includes the pirate party \( i had assumed that moniker was a joke , but it is n't \) not that mr graham s firecracker of a play spends time debating the candidates the focus instead is on the crosssection of society who come to vote the polling station functions as a locus of activity in the way that a restaurant or a taxi dispatch office might in a television sitcom there are those , of course , who staff the center and whose largely wellmeaning malfeasance gives the play what plot it has , but they share the stage both with various candidates and a motley parade of the citizenry at large an excitable lesbian couple fresh , we 're told , from eating scallops pops in early on , giving way later to a portuguese woman eager to know which is the socialist candidate and then several young women firsttime voters all who , in desperation , ask their cellphones for advice as to whom to choose the casting makes its own rather sweet point about democracy in theatrical terms , given that the swirl of actors both wellknown and not includes a 2014 tony nominee \( paul chahidi as a singleissue candidate of singular hilarity \) , several musical theater names \( rosalie craig is especially funny as nicholas burns s frosty , moneyed wife \) and ms dench the octogenarian dame shows up in the final 20 minutes to play a retired nurse who turns out to be a stickler for grammar at one point , ms dench does a mad little dance to demonstrate that there s life in her character yet and mr graham would surely argue that for all its fractiousness and partisanship so there is too in a free country s whirligig of politics two other recent openings offer further glimpses into contemporary life , albeit at opposite ends of the social spectrum make that a reopening , in the case of the audience , which has returned to the west end with a new dame kristin scott thomas playing queen elizabeth ii , even as the part s olivier awardwinning originator , helen mirren , continues with peter morgan s play on broadway \( ms mirren is widely considered the frontrunner for this year s best actress tony award for her performance \) how does ms scott thomas measure up \? quite charmingly , notwithstanding various line flubs at the performance i saw perhaps more naturally regal and , if possible , even more beautiful than ms mirren , ms scott thomas has the disadvantage of coming afresh to a challenge that her predecessor had previously met on screen if ms scott thomas is still finding her way into this imagined view of her majesty s weekly audiences with her various prime ministers , the natural empathy she brings to the role is already apparent she mines the ready humor that animates what could merely be a parade of conversational tableaux were the director , stephen daldry , less deft at finding the pulse behind the postage stamp , to coopt a notably clever line that mr morgan s elizabeth uses to describe herself \( ms scott thomas has a field day with the late sequence where the queen dozes off middebriefing \) while she never especially sounds like the longserving monarch a certain highpitched clippedness is n't there the actress appears to relish a cutandthrust that places the world s most famous woman opposite politicians the queen is said to have adored including the labour leader harold wilson , played here by nicholas woodeson , making the most of a prime supporting role and or disliked that second category is energetically fleshed out by sylvestra le touzel , easily the best of the three margaret thatchers i have now seen in this play near the end , we see the queen concluding her final audience with the current prime minister , david cameron \( mark dexter , doubling effortlessly as tony blair \) , by wishing him well as he heads toward reelection will mr morgan have to write a new character into the script with whom ms scott thomas can additionally reflect on a royal s life and times \?

re \( front page , june 18 \) there is so much more that goes into being a competent teacher than one s ability to score well on a standardized exam i can list quite a few qualities , such as compassion a facility for communicating and listening creativity wisdom , experience and common sense good organizational skills none of these skills are tested by the standardized exams now in place it is disheartening to consider that so many candidates of fine potential might be turned away from the teaching profession because of these irrelevant exams penny prince bronx compliments for emphasizing the issue of bias on the latest teacher certification tests in new york but the bias extends beyond ethnicity to socioeconomic issues as well every one of the tests is expensive , and many of the students in our program at queens college cannot afford to pay for them having a private company make so much money on the backs of teacher candidates who are not yet earning salaries is simply an outrage alice f artzt flushing , queens the article cites testimony from a state expert saying that teacher licensure tests are meant to protect the public from incompetent teachers there are at least two problems with this argument first , the tests that are under fire do not do a very good job of evaluating the competencies that are required of teachers the academic literacy skills test , in particular , requires a demonstration of skills that are so far removed from what teachers should know and be able to do that it is all but meaningless improving the scores on this test will do nothing to improve the quality of our teachers second , incompetence generally does not manifest itself until a new teacher is actually on the job and has been mentored , coached and carefully evaluated all to no avail no preservice test will uncover this the \( highly profitable \) testing monster that has devoured k12 education has simply turned its eye to colleges and universities that prepare teachers howard miller dobbs ferry , ny your article raises a very important issue when standards in mathematics are raised for students , they must also be raised for teachers however , sadly , when the bar is raised , the current crop of candidates for teaching positions in mathematics fail the new tests the data comes as no surprise to me the obvious solution raise salaries for teaching at the k12 level year after year , our most talented math majors shun k12 teaching as a career instead , they choose jobs in computerrelated fields , or in finance or college teaching their reasons were clear teaching at the k12 level is both poorly paid and lacks prestige if we were to focus on raising salaries and increasing the prestige of teaching in elementary or high school , the skills levels of the candidates would go up , too joan s birman new rochelle

beirut , lebanon the arab nations of the persian gulf have some the world s highest per capita incomes their leaders speak passionately about the plight of syrians , and their statefunded news media cover the syrian civil war without cease yet as millions of syrian refugees languish elsewhere in the middle east and many have risked their lives to reach europe or died along the way , gulf nations have agreed to resettle only a surprisingly small number of refugees as the migration crisis overwhelms europe and after crystallized syrian desperation , humanitarian groups are increasingly accusing the arab world s richest nations of not doing enough to help out accenting that criticism are the deep but shadowy roles countries like and have played in by bankrolling rebels fighting president bashar alassad and wealthy gulf citizens with or without their governments' knowledge have helped fund the rise of syria s jihadists , according to american officials burden sharing has no meaning in the gulf , and the saudi , emirati and qatari approach has been to sign a check and let everyone else deal with it , said sarah leah whitson , executive director of human rights watch for its middle east and north africa division now everyone else is saying , that s not fair' there are , in fact , hundreds of thousands of syrians in the gulf , where vast oil wealth and relatively small citizen populations have made the countries prime destinations for workers from poorer arab countries and elsewhere while many expatriates are professionals who have built lucrative careers there , most are lowpaid laborers who give up their rights to get jobs and can be deported with little notice this group now contains many syrians who have fled the war , although they get none of the protections or financial support that come with legal refugee or asylum status , nor a path to future citizenship benefits gulf countries do not grant gulf officials and commentators reject the criticism , however , saying that their countries have generously funded humanitarian aid and that giving syrians the ability to work is better than leaving them with nothing to do in economically struggling countries and squalid refugee camps if it was n't for the gulf states , you would expect these millions to be in a much more tragic state than they are , said abdulkhaleq abdulla , a political science professor in the , which he said has taken in more than 160 , 000 syrians in the last three years this fingerpointing at the gulf that they are not doing anything , it is just not true others bristle at criticism from the united states and the west , whom they accuse of letting the conflict fester for more than four years while mr assad s forces deployed chemical weapons and bombed civilian areas , causing so many people to flee why is it that there are just questions about the position of the gulf , but not about who is behind the crisis , who created the crisis \? asked khalid aldakhil , a political science professor at king saud university in riyadh , saudi arabia he acknowledged that the gulf could do more , but directed the blame toward iran and russia , which have heavily backed mr assad and his military while also refusing to resettle syrian refugees fueling the criticism is the tremendous wealth in the gulf , a region filled with sprawling malls , gleaming skyscrapers and wide boulevards clogged with suvs that opulence is clearly lacking in syria s neighbors , where most of the conflict s are , for example , has an annual per capita income of 11 , 000 and has received 630 , 000 refugees is richer , but has more than 12 million syrians , making them about onequarter of the population has the most , about two million , with a per capita income of 20 , 000 those average incomes are a fraction of the figures for qatar , 143 , 000 , 71 , 000 or saudi arabia , 52 , 000 , according to the international monetary fund gulf countries have contributed to humanitarian aid saudi arabia has given 184 million to the fund so far this year , while kuwait has given more than 304 million , making it the world s thirdlargest donor the united states has given the most , 11 billion , and has agreed to resettle about 1 , 500 syrians many syrians , too , have criticized the gulf for trumpeting its outrage while doing little that would compromise its high standard of living we know that the gulf could take in syrian refugees , but they have never responded , said omar hariri , a syrian who had recently fled turkey on an inflatable raft with his wife and 2yearold daughter speaking by phone from athens , he said he saw hope in europe , not in the gulf they have helped the rebels , not the refugees , mr hariri said this week , the kuwaiti commentator fahad alshelaimi said in a tv interview that his country was too expensive for refugees , but appropriate for laborers you ca n't welcome people from another environment and another place who have psychological or nervous system problems or trauma and enter them into societies , he said cartoonists have lampooned such ideas drew a man in traditional gulf dress behind a door and barbed wire , directing a refugee to another door with the european union flag open the door to them now ! the man yells another shows a gulf sheikh shaking his finger at a boat full of refugees while flashing a thumbsup to a rebel fighter in a burning syria one syrian took aim at gulf leaders we are hosting syrian refugees , but only if they have kuwaiti citizenship , the emir of kuwait in , the president of the united arab emirates says his country has received many wealthy refugees in dubai many in the gulf have turned their ire to the united states and its western allies , blaming them for not intervening forcefully against mr assad in a way they believe could have ended the conflict and stopped the refugee flow this week , nasser alkhalifa , a former qatari diplomat , , accusing western officials of shedding crocodile tears over the plight of syrians he said unnamed other countries had wanted to give antiaircraft weapons to the rebels to defend against air attacks on civilian areas , but had been blocked he also accused the obama administration of not forcefully intervening in syria out of fear that it would ruin the talks with iran now european and american officials facing their shortsighted policies must welcome more syrian refugees , mr khalifa wrote michael stephens , the head of the royal united services institute in qatar , said that the decision not to directly intervene had left many in the gulf unsure of how to respond the gulf arabs are used to a paradigm in which the west is continuously stepping in to solve the problem , and this time it has n't , mr stephens said this has left many people looking at the shattered vase on the floor and pointing fingers

of course he was alive we could both see the safe numbers and steady waves marching across the monitor only the measure of the oxygen circulating in his blood hovered low he had stabilized and had been taken off his ventilator , but his body wasn t rising to the challenge of consciousness and physical independence for a few days we had used cpap \( continuous positive airway pressure \) , a device that pushes oxygen through a mask and is one step away from intubation but cpap is meant for people who are awake and able to pull off the mask if , for example , they throw up and the machine begins to push vomit into their lungs he was no longer a good candidate for it , and now we were trying not to use it of the many devices available to support breathing , none of them was a good solution for him his family knew that he wasn t breathing enough , and wasn t awake it wasn t pneumonia or lung disease and it wasn t a result of neurological damage from his stroke he was just weak and not well he was facing being intubated again , and it was clear that if he went back on a ventilator , he would need it for the rest of his life his wife and children were talking about making his status do not resuscitate do not intubate , but they hadn t decided , and they were waiting for a son who lived far away to weigh in and it was the weekend staffing was low in the icu no attending physician was present and things were on pause except of course they weren t the patient was living through these hours and days , mask on , mask off , a feeding tube in his nose , ivs in his arms , having his dry mouth sponged , his throat suctioned , defecating and being cleaned up he was alive , and while he wasn t in pain , he wasn t passing the time pleasantly i was on a 12hour overnight shift my next patient arrived around midnight as i watched him being wheeled in from the emergency room , i thought he had a skin condition , but when we hauled him onto the bed i realized that his face and neck were covered in dried vomit the er staff had been too busy trying to stabilize him to wipe him off he was in his 30s he had chronic pain and had taken narcotics , and his girlfriend found him unconscious he was seizing continuously , and after doing a combination of not breathing and inhaling vomit for some time , his lungs were in very bad shape his blood pressure needed to be artificially maintained , and because his glucose remained high even after plenty of insulin , we started an insulin drip too he was sick after spending the first half of the night caring for the old man next door , i was drawn away from him , but i watched closely enough to know that despite my sitting him up in bed and giving him as much oxygen as i could , his breathing was getting worse the doctor knew that the family was considering switching to comfort measures only , and hoped not to escalate his care but while the doctor stood over the young , critically ill man , placing an arterial line in his groin , working steadily to save him , i had to point out that if we didn t put the old man back on cpap soon , we d end up performing an emergency intubation from behind his sterile mask came the doctor s exasperated sigh what we re not doing is helping him as if i didn t know but our job was to provide intensive care we didn t have the choice to let him slowly stop breathing we had to tailor our care to the numbers on the monitor and the orders in his chart that night , we put the him back on cpap when i came back to work 12 hours later , he had been intubated a hard plastic tube pushed through his mouth down his trachea , taped to the delicate skin of his face the younger patient , meanwhile , had started breathing and moving his limbs on my next shift two days later , the old man s room was empty his family had gathered , seen him back on the ventilator , and asked to stop treatment not atypically , he had died after a couple of weeks of maintenance by intensive medical care and the other patient \? i smiled when i saw on the nurse assignment sheet that he had boundary issues , and a few minutes in his room confirmed this inappropriate and annoying a status reserved for only the healthiest of icu patients we had simply and decisively saved his life this is what i thought i d signed up for when i took the job , but i had rarely experienced it in my two years as a nurse when i first realized that in intensive care we held lives in limbo more often than we saved lives , i asked a friend who was a more experienced nurse how she felt about that she said that sometimes a stay in the icu lets a patient s family prepare for his death but while it may soften the shock of death for the family , being in the icu is unpleasant and bizarre for the patient i ve often spoken with patients family members who seem to feel that an icu is a timefree holding zone that intensive care functions as a pause button those conversations usually take place on the phone it s harder to believe in this pause button when you witness the constant poking and suctioning , the invasive examining and monitoring , the parade of medications and the contraptions necessary to deliver them , the lights and alarms , the coughing and grimacing and shuddering or , in the less responsive , the bloating and stiffening or slackening and eventually the eerie dehumanization of both the patient and the caregiver thinking that intensive care can pause the march of time is a misunderstanding or a willful fantasy there are always bargains to be made and discomforts to be faced in a place that is staving off death time goes by quickly caring for patients like that young , scarily ill man it goes by too quickly for nurses and doctors to eat or sit down or even go to the bathroom it went by too quickly for the er staff to clean the vomit off his face each minute matters , and it feels like a focused race caring for patients like the old man doesn t feel like racing , it feels like waiting in cases like his , time goes by slowly but it definitely does not stop these days are lived for patients in the hospital surrounded by workers just as for patients at home or in hospice surrounded by people they love , these days at the end count americans are increasingly aware that a good death rarely happens on its own it needs to be negotiated and orchestrated more people complete advance directives so their families are not left to make endoflife decisions for them but every day thousands of the patients toughing it out in intensive care are in fact in a purgatory maintained by family members who are either too intimidated by the complex medical situation to get involved \( care providers who communicate poorly share the blame for this \) , or who don t realize that this time is crucial the cascade of responsibilities that occur when someone is dying has begun , even when the nurse on the telephone tells you that the patient is stable families should realize that this time is the end of life , and they should pay attention to its quality just as they would if the patient were dying at home that s because although we can usually hold off death , we cannot pause time , and an extended stay in the icu is an ugly way to end a life unless the medical record contains an order limiting the measures that can be taken , originating from the patient , his next of kin or his designated proxy , interventions to keep him alive will continue indefinitely , regardless of the anticipated outcome in quality of life when a family member is in the icu , it s not enough to call you need to drop what you re doing and be at that person s side , figuring out what is best for them doctors , nurses and technicians care about patients , but sometimes we cannot express our care by doing what we think is best for them in the icu , that is not our job our job is to preserve life often , when working with patients who have a quality of life it is impossible to imagine anyone wanting , we express our care by saying , i m sorry kristen mcconnell is an intensive care nurse who worked at johns hopkins hospital and is now living in brooklyn
this post includes spoilers for sunday s episode of game of thrones the headline of this piece could really be the headline of any piece about game of thrones , which rarely wavers from its presentation of a world in which terrible things happen to people both good and bad this season s penultimate episode was no different shireen baratheon , the young princess afflicted with greyscale , was burned to death at the behest of melisandre in an effort to ensure victory following a stealth attack by ramsay bolton but why would stannis choose to follow melisandre s advice , especially after reassuring his daughter several episodes back that he loved her so very much \( also , though this is increasingly less relevant , shireen is still alive in the books ! \) religious fanaticism , of course \( and lust for power the two are oft intertwined \) this season of game of thrones has focused a bit more on the various religious elements of westeros and essos , the two continents invented by george rr martin in his novels that compose the song of ice and fire series the main ones are the faith of the seven , which is the primary religion practiced in much of westeros , and the one to which the faith militant , currently causing trouble in king s landing , subscribe the faith believes in one god who has seven aspects , each represented by a symbolic personage the father , the mother , the warrior , the crone , the smith , the maiden and the stranger the old gods , revered by the starks and other northern folk worship of the old gods is akin to nature worship and takes place in godswoods , holy places that contain weirwood trees , which have white bark and red leaves and ooze bloodlike sap when cut the drowned god , which is the deity worshiped by the greyjoys and their subjects on the iron islands the manyfaced god , which is worshiped by the faceless men of braavos he s basically death and finally , the god most germane to this week s crushing events r hllor , also known as the lord of light and the red god his religion has been brought to westeros from essos , and melisandre is one of its primary missionaries \( another is thoros of myr , a member of the brotherhood without banners we met thoros in season 3 , during the scene in which the hound fights and kills a man wielding a flaming sword that man , beric dondarrion , is resurrected by the power of the lord of light , the sixth time he has been brought back to life \) when we first see melisandre at the beginning of season 2 , she has convinced stannis to burn effigies of the seven and convert to her religion he wants the throne once held by his brother robert , and melisandre has convinced him that this is the first step early results seemed to validate melisandre s claims in a memorable scene , she gives birth to a shadow monster that assassinates stannis s brother renly , who is also vying for the iron throne later , after stannis loses the battle of blackwater and attempts to strangle melisandre , she talks him down and has him look into flames , where he sees a vision of the future a great battle in the snow foreshadowing this week s events , she tells him you will betray your family you will betray everything you hold dear \( two other exchanges that assume awful resonance this week can be found in season 3 s episode second sons when stannis asks melisandre if she has slaughtered many lambs , she responds , and none have seen the blade and ser davos , then imprisoned , says to stannis , you re not a man who slaughters innocents , for gain or glory \) by the time stannis is stuck outside the walls of winterfell , he has come to believe melisandre s every word at one point , he has his brotherinlaw burned alive as a sacrifice to the lord of light in season 3 , after melisandre brings the baratheon bastard gendry back to dragonstone , extracts some of his blood through the use of leeches , and burns them , two of the people whose name she invokes die \( robb stark and joffrey baratheon balon greyjoy is the third \) king s blood is a powerful thing we knew that melisandre had plans for the girl when she asked queen selyse , near the end of season 4 , to make sure that shireen accompanied them to the wall and despite stannis s disgust with melisandre s suggestion , two episodes ago , that shireen be made a sacrifice , victory was clearly important enough to him that he was willing to kill a family member once again recall the second episode of season 4 , in which melisandre is sent to speak with shireen , who has stubbornly stuck to the faith of the seven as she explains to shireen when the little girl asks if there are seven heavens and seven hells , as her faith says there is , melisandre answers there is only one hell , princess the one we live in now she s right about that the night is dark and full of terrors
paris you spend 40 years building a flourishing business and , finally , with age catching up , you hand it over to the only one of your children who has shown pride in your life s work , understood its importance , and seemed ready to carry on the job then , with nary a word to you , she starts to shake up the family firm , offering new products , seeking new markets and undermining everything you believe in so do you just stand there and do nothing \? not if you 're jeanmarie le pen , the founder of s extremeright national front after spending years grooming the youngest of his three daughters , marine le pen , he handed over the party to her in 2011 but since then , she has abandoned his hardline positions and the extremist views he has long voiced in the process , she has won more followers than he ever enjoyed she is projected to be a top candidate in the 2017 presidential elections , and a threat to the two major parties mr le pen , for his part , has decided to strike back against what he clearly sees as betrayal by his own flesh and blood and if that means undermining his daughter s political strategy and even threatening the survival of the party , so be it the national front was his creation , and he refuses to be silenced this month , still wearing the mantle of honorary president of the party , mr le pen gave a series of interviews in which he recycled some of the racist , xenophobic and antisemitic views that have made him toxic to many french people in the past i am not a man to change his opinions or crawl , he declared he knew they would upset his daughter his aim is to harm me , she said in his latest diatribes , he went from reiterating his opinion that the holocaust was simply a detail in the history of to defending the record of marshall philippe p tain , the head of the collaborationist regime in vichy , which deported 75 , 000 jews to nazi death camps to his wellhoned hostility toward arab immigrants , he added asians , claiming absurdly that a million chinese now live in france and turning his guns on france s spanishborn prime minister , manuel valls , he lamented , we are governed at all levels by immigrants and children of immigrants marine le pen was shaken only four years ago , when she succeeded him , she praised his serene authority and integrity of thought and the righteousness , the nobility of spirit , the perseverance , the vision and at times the courage with which he led the national front with a prolonged economic slump feeding malaise across france , she has exploited both the unpopularity of president fran ois hollande s socialist government and the squabbling leadership of the centerright union for a popular movement , led by the former president nicolas sarkozy , to present herself as a new face and a fresh alternative and her populist message , focused on the economy , the evils of the european union and the corruption of traditional parties , has been getting through in last year s european union elections , the national front came out on top in france , with 26 percent of votes in departmental elections last month , it placed second , with 25 percent of votes recent polls even show that ms le pen could win the first round of the 2017 election , though probably not a runoff still , in just four years , she has moved her party from the periphery to the center of french politics now , thanks to her father , the national front is facing its greatest crisis ever but like father , like daughter ms le pen has come out fighting , dismissing her father as caught in a spiral between a strategy of scorched earth and political suicide she rescinded party backing for his candidacy in southeast france , where he enjoys considerable popularity , in regional elections this fall she has even begun disciplinary procedures against him in the party s executive bureau but will she dare to call on the party s members to revoke his title of honorary president and expel him from the party \? if mr le pen is afraid , he is n't showing it marine le pen perhaps hopes for my death , that s possible , but she ca n't count on my cooperation , he said , adding that his expulsion would implode the party the national front is already riven by a generational divide mr le pen s traditional support started with french military veterans who were opposed to algeria s independence in 1962 , along with opponents of immigration and even former communists who had been displaced from their jobs he still has a large and loyal following in the party in contrast , ms le pen s young advisers have persuaded her that both the party and her future candidacy can prosper only if she turns her back on what her father has come to represent family loyalty , they say , should not trump political opportunity the battle lines are drawn mr le pen has every intention of running in the regional elections , insisting that i am the lead candidate to kick out the socialistcommunists in that case , he would have to run as a rightwing dissident against his own party s official candidate and who might the party nominate to oppose him \? none other than his 25yearold granddaughter , marion mar challe pen could this internecine war bury marine le pen s dream of one day reaching the presidential palace \? or can she rescue the national front by demonstrating that her father has lost his marbles \? as shakespeare reminds us , battles for the throne always make for high drama in this case , the final act is still to come
kansas city , mo there were no firstpitch insidethepark home runs , no power failures and no starting pitchers working out of the bullpens into the 14th inning this time it was just ordinary baseball in game 2 of the world series after the series opened with an unusual and entertaining game 1 tuesday , a sense of normalcy returned to kauffman stadium on wednesday except for one important distinction for the first time in the postseason , jacob degrom was not unbeatable , and johnny cueto was cueto threw a twohit complete game , and the result was for the over the and a twogamestonone lead in the series of the 53 teams that have jumped out to a 20 lead in the world series , 42 have gone on to win two of the clubs that defied the trend , coincidentally , were the 1985 royals and the 1986 mets game 3 is set for friday at citi field , where noah syndergaard is scheduled to pitch against yordano ventura as the mets seek the comforts of home to gain their first win we 've got to pick it up offensively , manager terry collins said we 've got to do a better job of using the field to hit and we 've done it we certainly have done it we 've got to do it again degrom , who won two games in the mets' division series against the los angeles dodgers and one in the national league championship series against the chicago cubs , took his first postseason loss this time , facing a relentless lineup that is undeterred by even the most accomplished pitchers in baseball , degrom gave up four runs and six hits , walked three and struck out two he was unhittable for three innings , but then things began to unravel in the fifth , when the royals scored four times degrom , known for his ability to collect strikeouts , was not missing the royals' bats with his pitches he induced only three swings and misses , and he labored more than usual with too many balls crossing the hitting zone i told jake not everything has to be a strike , collins said you 've got to move it around you 've got to change speeds , give them something to look at if you continue to pound the strike zone , they 're going to put it in play , and that s what they did cueto , on the other hand , pitched the game of his life , allowing only two hits while striking out four and walking three in a magnificent effort tonight was everything we expected johnny to be , royals manager ned yost said he was on the attack since arriving in kansas city after a midseason trade from cincinnati , cueto has been unpredictable from one start to the next , the royals did not know whether cueto would be good or bad in the postseason , he was very bad in his most recent start against the toronto blue jays in the american league championship series , but he pitched fine in game 5 of the division series over all , he carried a 13 postseason record and a 693 earned run average into wednesday s game but he was much better , and the royals' offense supported his valiant effort with three addon runs in the eighth providing a cushion , yost felt free to send out cueto to finish the game , much to the delight of the fans , who roared when they saw him emerge from the dugout cueto said he was saddened by the news on tuesday that daniel volquez , the father of cueto s teammate and fellow dominican pitcher edinson volquez , had died that day it was a very sad day for me yesterday , he said and there was a lot of focus on my part i dedicated the game to volquez s dad and the whole family trailing by 10 , the royals broke through in the fifth by scoring four times against degrom , and doing it in a most royalslike way sending nine men to the plate without even collecting an extrabase hit there were five singles after a leadoff walk by alex gordon alex rios singled to left , and then alcides escobar twice tried to lay down a bunt before rapping a single to center , scoring gordon degrom got two outs , one of them coming on lorenzo cain s nerveracking line drive to center that was as well struck as any hit better than even the ground ball by hosmer in the next atbat but hosmer s ball went up the middle , beyond the diving shortstop wilmer flores and into center field rios and escobar scored , and hosmer turned to his teammates in the dugout and gave an emphatic celebratory gesture jake came out pitching great , david wright said but they just grinded him out kendrys morales followed with a single to right field , barely over the shifted infield , and mike moustakas came to the plate with runners at first and third and two outs and three runs in moustakas drove one pitch from degrom down the rightfield line , but it hooked foul by only two feet then he drove another to the opposite corner , also foul finally , he settled on a ground ball up the middle , this one eluding the belated diving effort of daniel murphy , and hosmer scored to make it 41 the royals' pitchers have done a good job keeping murphy in check he entered the world series with home runs in his previous six postseason games and then went 2 for 7 in game 1 with a run scored in game 2 , he went 0 for 2 with two walks and struck out twice we stressed it enough , collins said when we play good , our lineup produces throughout it just shows you right now with us not hitting how big daniel murphy really was in the nlcs with the home runs
culiac n , mexico when jos antonio sevilla and his three brothers learned that the notorious drug trafficker known as had escaped from prison , they jumped out of their chairs and shouted with glee el chapo got out ! he s the greatest of them all , said mr sevilla , 19 , a selfprofessed fan of the drug kingpin , whose full name is he was famous before , but now he s even more famous mr sevilla , an auto mechanic , was so excited that he attended a march through the streets of culiac n , the capital of mr guzm n s home state , this week to celebrate he carried a sign that a woman gave him , which read , el chapo is more of a president than pe a nieto , a reference to s president , enrique pe a nieto here in sinaloa state , where mr guzm n was born , and even in other parts of , the drug trafficker s stunning escape through a hidden tunnel under what was supposed to be the country s most secure prison has enhanced his status as an outlaw folk hero there are few illusions about the damage mr guzm n has done accuse him of contributing to the death and destruction of millions of lives across the globe through drug addiction , violence and corruption yet for many mexicans , he is an unusual combination of robin hood and billionaire , a source of mirth , grudging respect and even outright reverence because of his repeated ability to outfox the country s deeply unpopular government he fought the law , and he won he beat what many mexicans see as a corrupt and feckless governing class and mexico , just like america , loves an outlaw why do people admire him \? said adri n cabrera , a blogger in culiac n wearing a black tshirt with a picture of el chapo because he s a living legend he s like al capone he s like lucky luciano like tony soprano like scarface he s like a character on a television show , except that he s alive , he s real in the cultural center in badiraguato , the main town in the municipality where mr guzm n grew up , there is a list of the notable people born in the area , including a general in the mexican revolution , a journalist , a lawyer and a congressman there is no mention of its most famous son , mr guzm n , but the center s director of events argues that el chapo deserves to be on the list , too he has never had any problems with people here , said the events director , guadalupe olivas he was poor , and now he has lots of money and lots of power mr guzm n was born in the 1950s in a remote hamlet in the lumpy green mountains that are the backdrop to the state capital , in an area known as the golden triangle , which today is mexico s prime marijuana growing region over the years , mr guzm n rose through the ranks of mexican drug gangs until he came to head the largest of them all , the sinaloa cartel , named for the state where he continued to spend a good deal of time even as a wanted man when he was arrested last year , the authorities found him at the sinaloan beach resort of mazatl n mr guzm n operates a vast international organization forbes magazine has included him in its list of the world s richest people , with an estimated net worth of more than 1 billion he escaped from prison once before , by some accounts hiding in a laundry cart , and his most recent breakout was highly elaborate he passed through a sophisticated tunnel about a mile long , one equipped with lights , ventilation and even a motorcycle on rails to excavate the dirt it took a lot of intelligence to do that , said erica lara , who sells shaved ice in the plaza of badiraguato there are powerful people who have to serve their entire sentences but he escaped two times many here said that mr guzm n helped residents , often in small ways a family with a sick member might receive a visitor delivering money for treatment , they said , although none could point to a specific example while sinaloa is mexico s tomatogrowing capital , the area around badiraguato has the distinction of being the cradle of the mexican drug trade besides mr guzm n , several other major traffickers were born here or in the nearby hills many here say that the streets were paved using money from traffickers while buying a shaved ice in the badiraguato plaza , amairany avilez , 20 , called mr guzm n my hero she said that the economy in the region depended on mr guzm n , and that people might now get work on land he owns or could grow more marijuana to sell to his organization when they arrested him , people around here had to go back to growing corn , ms avilez said now the corn will turn into marijuana experts say that drug production does not depend much on whether a single trafficker , no matter how influential , is in or out of jail beyond that , sinaloa last year ranked second in the government s measure of intentional homicides per capita , at a level more than two and a half times the national average yet many people here said that their state was relatively calm thanks to mr guzm n s influence scarlett l pez , 22 , who works at a finance company in culiac n , said that while she disapproved of mr guzm n s drug trafficking , she was glad he was out of prison because it meant that even worse drug gangs the zetas , for instance , known for cutting off people s heads and other acts of graphic violence would be less likely to try to encroach on the state i feel better because we 're protected , she said there are people who are a lot worse near a government office building here in the state capital is an elaborate shrine dedicated to a folk saint known as jes s malverde he is often called the narcosaint because he is worshiped by many drug traffickers malverde is supposedly based on a local man who lived from 1870 to 1909 , and was known as a bandit who stole from the rich to give to the poor he is also worshiped by poor people , farmers , fishermen and others this week , a stream of devotees visited the shrine , some lighting candles , some kneeling to pray before a plaster bust of malverde , portrayed with black hair and mustache , a white westernstyle shirt and black neckerchief there were flowers on either side , and the air was dense with the smell of hot wax a statue of the virgin of guadalupe stood by the entrance the walls were covered in plaques left by devotees , thanking malverde for favors or miracles the government has offered a reward of about 38 million for information leading to mr guzm n s capture , but people visiting the shrine said they would not lend the government a hand the drug dealers do more for the people than the government does , said eric reyes , 33 , a systems engineer from mexico city , who stopped by the shrine out of curiosity while on vacation if you live in a dealer s territory he treats you well the government wo n't do anything for you it s all bureaucracy and red tape such sentiment appears to prevail through much of the country and across social strata , including in the more upscale districts of mexico city , where many people displayed a grudging admiration for mr guzm n driving the private enjoyment of his escape is a deep cynicism about the government , which has such low credibility among mexicans that many refuse to believe the official story about how el chapo got away many assume that he could not have escaped without help from within the prison , and others question whether the tunnel was not simply an elaborate ruse to hide corruption that extends to the highest levels conspiracy theories are rife the fact that the breakout occurred as the president was starting a trip to france is seen as indicative of higherlevel collusion the fact that a picture released by the authorities shows mr guzm n with a shaved head , while video of his escape shows that he had a full head of hair , is also cause for suspicion the escape and the humiliation it has heaped on the government have set off a kind of national catharsis and the fact that mr pe a nieto did not cut short his lengthy visit to france , where he has gone to napoleon s tomb and received medals , only confirmed to many how out of touch the government is the government is chapo s , said genero reyes mart nez , 30 , in mexico city i bet he walked straight out of the main gate that tunnel was an illusion
jonathan chait seems boggled at an oped from stephen moore , the chief economist at the heritage foundation , attacking obamacare not one alleged fact cited in the piece is right and we re not talking about matters of interpretation cbo has not changed its view that the aca will reduce the deficit health costs have not increased faster than before premiums are not skyrocketing chait treats this as a story about the way the right is handling obamacare s success conservatives made a number of very specific predictions about what would happen when the aca went into effect health spending would soar , deficits would balloon , premiums would shoot up , more people would lose insurance than gain it when none of these things happened , when the law s first year of full operation went better than even supporters had expected , the reaction was , i believe , something new in american politics rightwingers simply acted as if their predictions had come true , as if all the imagined disasters were actual truths on the ground that is indeed part of the story about that moore oped but there s another aspect of the story , which is moore himself this is a guy who has a troubled relationship with facts i don t mean that he s a slick dissembler i mean that he seems more or less unable to publish an article without filling it with howlers true , all erring in the direction he wants in a way that ends up doing his cause a disservice for example , his attempt to refute something i wrote about kansas ended up being mainly a story about why stephen can t count , which presumably wasn t his intention but here s the mystery evidently moore has had a successful career why \? think about heritage it s immensely wealthy , and could surely afford to hire a technically competent rightwing hack the wall street journal , similarly , could have attracted someone much less likely to trip over his own intellectual shoelaces again , the problem isn t even that moore got the macroeconomics of recent years all wrong , although he did it s the inability to write without making embarrassing mistakes so why is he there \( and he s not alone there are some other incompetent hacks at heritage \) \? i suspect that the incompetence is actually desirable at some level a smart hack might turn honest , or something , but it s remarkable
on july 26 , 1969 , a group of young latinos stood in the band shell in tompkins square park , in the east village , and made an announcement they were founding a new york branch of a revolutionminded political party called the young lords inspired by the black panthers and an earlier streetgangturnedactivist young lords group in chicago , their purpose was to gain social justice for new york s workingclass latino population , then largely puerto rican and treated with contempt by the city government most of the members onstage that day were recent college graduates well versed in leftist political theory to gain the trust and cooperation of latino communities concentrated in the east village , east harlem and the south bronx they knew they needed to get their feet on the street , and they wasted no time the next day they started a garbage offensive in east harlem , the barrio , pulling mounds of trash left festering by the city s sanitation department into the middle of third avenue and setting the refuse alight local residents pitched in in october of that year , the young lords teamed up with a band of mostly black and latino hospital personnel to force improvements in labor conditions and medical services for the poor at gouverneur hospital on the lower east side \( six months later , they would take over lincoln hospital in the bronx for the same reasons \) in december , they occupied an east harlem church and , until the police evicted them , turned it into a food dispensary and free clinic by day and a performance space for music , poetry readings and history lessons at night by that point they had started a newspaper , palante \( the name , a contraction of para adelante , means forward or right on \) bilingual and published every two weeks , it was a color tabloid with some of the jazziest graphics around you 'll find dozens of copies covering the walls in the tripartite exhibition presente ! the young lords in new york spread over three institutions the  in east harlem and , a cultural center in the east village this show departs from straight political history by presenting the young lords as a cultural phenomenon as well as an ideological one , with a highly developed instinct for visual selfprojection , right down to having an official party photographer , the gifted  each of the show s three parts is more or less selfcontained , giving a general picture of the party s brief history while centering on events specific to each venue the bronx museum portion , for example , organized by two new yorkbased art historians , johanna fern ndez and yasmin ramirez , focuses on the july 1970 takeover of lincoln hospital , which is not far from the museum , but also touches on developments elsewhere in the city it gives particular attention to links between the young lords and , a print workshop started in east harlem in 1970 by a group of puerto rican artists marcos dimas , adri n garcia , carlos osorio , manuel otero , martin rubio and armando soto still in operation in a converted public school building at 106th street and lexington avenue , the workshop was originally across the street from the barrio headquarters of the lords , who occasionally appropriated prints for palante covers mostly , though , the exchange was in the form of aesthetic influence the workshop s presence seemed to inspire members of the party who were artists , an africanamerican member of the lords who designed several palante covers , was one she was also one of the few women to gain a place in the party s governing hierarchy like many other maledominated radical groups , the young lords were inherently sexist and promoted a form of revolutionary machismo in their original statement of purpose she would have none of it under pressure from her and another female member , iris morales , the group revised the statement to read we want equality for women down with machismo and male chauvinism those words appear in the bronx show and again in the installation at el museo del barrio , organized by rocio arandaalvarado and sharply designed by ignacio v zquezparavano there are brilliant , monumental prints here by , juan s nchez and rafael tufi o , although the general mood is dark a photograph by geno rodriguez records a demonstration after a teenager named martin perez died while in police custody an issue of palante records the death , under similar circumstances , of julio rold n , a young lords member when the lords staged an angerfueled funeral procession for him in the streets of the barrio , they were fully armed a 1970 video of the poet reciting his chantlike puerto rican obituary feels like a lament for the end of a certain type of activism the young lords party was already beginning to narrow along hard ideological lines and splinter into competitive factions it had bought into american gun culture , becoming its own enemy in the process the group had lost its connection to the grassroots communities it was meant to serve the pietri poem , however , ends with a direct address to the people of those communities , exhorting them to carry on and to find joy where they can and in who they are the exhibition at loisaida inc , which opens next thursday , is pitched in that key organized by wilson valentinescobar and libertad o guerra , it s about the cultural legacy that the lords left , a populist activism that produced vivid images and had the imaginative lift of performance art in that upbeat spirit , mr pietri often collaborated with another former young lord , eddie figueroa you see them in beautiful photographic portraits by ad l maldonado at the bronx museum in 1976 , mr figueroa founded a space for experimentation , the new rican village cultural arts center in the east village taller boricua artists like sandra maria esteves and nestor otero appeared there so did a who swho of musicians combining africancaribbean forms with jazz the mood , as captured in a series of fabulous photographs by maximo colon , was ebullient and embracing in terms of identity , the young lords were , at least initially , also embracing puerto rican society is multiethnic and multicultural so was the party this may be one reason that feminism was able to forge a presence , and why the lords made common cause with the gay rights movement a month before the tompkins square park announcement , the stonewall riots happened across town , a transgender latino performer who was rumored to have been involved in the riots and was arrested soon afterward , joined the lords and helped attract a lesbian and gay contingent there s a small photographic homage to her at loisaida inc and there are tributes to other figures from the past by contemporary artists elsewhere at the bronx museum , the young new york painter has three strong paintandcollage pictures made in collaboration with women who had been young lords and a sculpture by , also at the bronx museum , commemorates a militant offshoot of the lords , a puerto rican nationalist group called , or the machete wielders for them , mr luciano has customized a pair of nike sneakers by transforming the brand s swoosh logo into a machete emblem in doing so , he symbolically gives these activists a swift means for attack and retreat but he also asks a blunt question , particularly pertinent in the marketsaturated present , about the bond between rebellion and consumption how revolutionary can you be if what you 're basically fighting for is the right to have the coolest usually meaning the most expensive shoes on the block \? the young lords , who knew a lot about style , might have had a persuasive answer for that we could use one
season 1 , episode 1 uno gather round , all ye breaking bad starved masses huddle up and let us appraise the prequel we have awaited since television s finest new mexicoset dark comedy spaghetti western bid its adieu our beloved meth maestro walter white , last seen bloodied and shuffling off this mortal coil , to the sweet arpeggios of badfinger s baby blue , is but a blissful memory ditto jesse pinkman , who escaped fast and furious style , from the drugproduction facility and cage where he d toiled against his will at the merciless prodding of some tattooed white supremacists dearly beloved , they are gone but hallelujah their sleazy , fleetwitted lawyer is back yes , at long last , better call saul is here a whole series , built around an amoral defense attorney with a combover and a bag of cultural references that date to the early 80s it is brought to us by key players behind breaking bad , writerdirector vince gilligan and writer peter gould to put it mildly , the show arrives with high expectations not harperleehasanewnovel high but high note to readers this recap will assume breaking bad knowledge , so if any of you have wandered in without watching that show , do yourself a favor leave whatever screen you are staring at right now , and come back in about two days , which is the time it will take to watch all five seasons , uninterrupted you can thank me later it is too soon to know whether bcs , as it shall henceforth be known in this space , meets the standards set by the creators previous work but it is certainly off to a dozier start , and the opening minutes of the first episode in stark contrast to the frenetic beginning of breaking bad are positively somnambulant on purpose we remake the acquaintance of saul goodman , now living under a new name and identity and working at a cinnabon in the food court of a nebraska mall a fate that saul himself grimly predicted in the penultimate episode of breaking bad \( if i m lucky , a month from now , bestcase scenario , i m managing a cinnabon in omaha \) the footage is black and white , which usually is a signal to viewers that we re in the past in this case , it s a signal that we re in the present , eavesdropping on saul s postrelocation life the ink spots address unknown plays \( sample lyric honey child , i ain t even got a trace of you \) , underscoring the total success of his vanishing act the only hint that this particular cinnabon employee is a fugitive comes when a burly , 20ish male customer appears to give saul the stink eye , and starts walking purposefully in his direction but the guy is just meeting family and friends , who happen to be in saul s line of sight saul heaves a sigh of relief he is still a nobody anonymity and tranquility , however , do not come naturally to a man who once served as consigliere and asset manager to a multimilliondollar drug trafficker cut to saul identified as gene on his cinnabon name tag alone in his tiny , snowsurrounded house , watching a home shopping channel that is pitching renoir prints \( i see here the handiwork of mr gilligan , a man who loves art so much he once worked as professional art mover , and who must have been tickled by the crassness of massmarketed renoirs \) in search of more invigorating viewing , exsaul rummages around for a hidden box that contains a vcr tape , one with a reel of commercials he cut for local albuquerque television , pimping himself and his law practice thus , we learn in the opening minutes of bcs that our eponymous antihero has settled in , far from the sunscorched excitement of his previous incarnation , peacefully and miserably the question of how he wound up in nebraska is explained in the last episodes of breaking bad how saul became saul is the point of the first episode of bcs switching to color and leaping back about six years and a lot of hair in time , we meet him under the name he was given at birth , james mcgill unlike saul , who is selfassured and well off , james or jimmy , as he s known by friends and potential clients is broke and riddled with selfdoubt he is first seen in court , gamely presenting arguments on behalf of three 19yearolds near honors students , all charged with performing a lewd act on a freshly separated human head , apparently after hours in a funeral home oh to be 19 again , saul tells the jury , trying to cast this grim crime as youthful indiscretion do you remember 19 \? let me tell you the juices are flowing , the red corpuscles are corpuscling for this doomed effort saul earns a measly 700 as he leaves the courthouse with his check , bcs starts to remind viewers that the show is set in the same universe as breaking bad who is the parking lot attendant who tells jimmy he ll need five stickers , not three , to exit the premises \? why , it s mike ehrmantraut , clearly no longer a philadelphia cop , but perhaps not yet the professional fixer and assassin for meth overlord gus fring and if you ever wondered how saul came up with the idea of laundering jesse pinkman s money through a nail salon , wonder no more jimmy s office is in the rear of such a salon , although office seems too grand a term for a tiny space beside a boiler the guy can t even afford a secretary , so he affects a ludicrous british accent when he takes a calls on his cellphone one of the calls is from a certain craig kettleman , a county treasurer who may soon be facing arrest and prosecution for embezzlement charges jimmy meets kettleman at a cafe and suggests a little proactivity may be in order but just as a letter of engagement is about to get signed , his wife , betsy , whom craig has brought along , stays her husband s hand and asks for more time saul would have closed that deal , but this is james , who is tentative and defeatable for esteem he has only his esteem , which the internet tells me is an actual model of car , made in india this one is a yellow junker , and he leaves that cafe he accidentally drives it into a late 20ish skateboarder , who bounces off the windshield and lands on the pavement the spectacle has been videotaped by the victim s twin brother , who quickly threatens to call the cops the brothers , both bearded , shaggy redheads , demand an instant settlement of 500 , which james is on the verge of paying until it dawns on him that this is a charade , a setup and a shakedown one that , we later learn , reminds him of his own days as slippin jimmy , a professional plaintiff courtesy of the icecoated sidewalks of his hometown , cicero , ill he triumphantly announces that he knows the twins ruse and further that the only way his car is worth 500 is if there is a 300 hooker sitting in it the lads flee we shall meet them again after a visit to his tiny , backofthesalon office , bcs pivots into what appears to be its central plotline james visits the slick corporate law offices of hamlin , hamlin mcgill \( the mcgill in the name has nothing to do with james , and the possible branding confusion , it is eventually hinted , is why will soon jewishize his name \) james is unwelcome at the firm , for reasons that aren t yet clear , but he buffaloes his way into a conferenceroom meeting of lawyers who seem to run the place saul is there to demand a 17 million severance package on behalf of chuck mcgill , apparently a founding partner of the firm , and certainly a guy on medical leave , mcgill has told the firm that he plans to return after he recovers from an ailment related to an debilitating sensitivity to electromagnetic fields the precise nature of this ailment becomes clearer when james leaves the firm , furious and emptyhanded , and visits chuck , played by michael mckean \( viewers may remember him from any number of movies , including this is spinal tap , or as the 2010 champion of celebrity jeopardy \) to enter chuck s home , you leave your watch and cellphone in his mail box and then tap some electrical switch to ground yourself , in the electrical sense chuck s house has no lights or refrigerator and he works by lantern on a manual typewriter he is a shut in , somehow afflicted by electrical currents psychosomatic or not but eager to overcome this torment and return to work maybe electromagnetic fields will do for bcs what chemistry did for breaking bad serve as both plot catalyst and metaphor maybe chuck is just going through a rough patch either way , jimmy tells chuck to cash out of hhm because chuck is on the verge of bankruptcy and jimmy can t financially support him any longer chuck will have none of it you know i m going to beat this , he says plus , he reveals to jimmy , hhm has started sending him a weekly stipend james leaves bereft and badly in need of a client so he devises an elaborate trap , enlisting those skateboarding scammer twins their job is to get hit by betsy kettleman s car , a mercury sable wagon , which drives the same route every day the idea is that james will happen by soon after the moment of impact , and talk the brothers out of suing the woman \( the pair will later be paid 2 , 000 for their troubles \) in her gratitude , betsy will convince her husband to hire james for that embezzlement case what could possibly go wrong \? a lot , actually the brothers execute the collision perfectly , but moments after the accident occurs , the sable peels off the brothers give chase , hanging on to the back of a truck the sable pulls into a driveway , but the woman who exits isn t mrs kettleman it s an elderly woman , speaking spanish and sounding confused , although her windshield is certainly busted james frantically searches for the brothers they were briefly in cellphone contact and he happens across the parked sable \( this seems like quite a coincidence but never mind \) he bangs on the front door it s opened by a man we see only the huge silver gun he is pointing in james face we see him yank james into the house by the shirt then the man pokes his head out of the door to look for witnesses at last , we see his face it s tuco , the violent and psychotic meth dealer who kidnaps walter white and jesse pinkman in breaking bad the door closes and episode the final seconds of this show are arguably its most promising nobody is better at dropping characters into lethallooking pickles than vince gilligan , and this pickle looks pretty lethal put another way , the ending was the breaking bad est part of this debut it suggests that bcs isn t going to remain a drama about an aging , housebound lawyer and the slick law firm that may be trying to weasel him out of due profits there will be blood , risk , drugs , weapons and stark moral choices if this first episode has a flaw it is built into the architecture of the story this is the tale of the origins of saul goodman , but that persona doesn t really show up until the middle of the hour , as career anxiety produces the sort of illegal scheming and mordant dialogue for which he is loved i knew our man had arrived , still unrechristened , when he drives the twins to the home of the kettleman s , to show them what that mercury sable looks like nice boat , one of the brothers says , noting the incongruous vessel parked in the yard yeah , says james , discreet like a stripper pole in a mosque welcome back , saul you ve been missed and now that you re in tuco s clutches , find that silver tongue of yours , licketysplit any guesses about how jimmy saul will talk his way out of this one \? and did i miss any breaking bad shout outs \?
the republican presidential candidates have demonstrated such an appetite for debates that if i set up nine lecterns in my living room on a weeknight around 8 pm and chanted carpet bomb and anchor baby , they 'd probably materialize en masse , even before i had time to vacuum and put out the artichoke dip but i could send savethedate cards , promise canap s by mario batali and recruit adele to belt out hello whenever the doorbell rang still the democrats would n't show up what a shamefully imbalanced primary season this has been for all their flaws and fakery , the republican candidates have squared off frequently , at convenient hours and despite the menacing nimbus of donald trump s hair the democratic candidates have , in contrast , hidden in a closet tuesday night s meeting of republicans , who sparred in las vegas over how to keep america safe , was the fifth the meeting of democratic presidential candidates in a few days will be only the third and who s going to watch it \? it s on a saturday night , when a political debate ranks somewhere between dialysis and a milli vanilli tribute concert as a desirable way to unwind the last meeting of the democratic candidates was also on a saturday night , and fewer than nine million viewers tuned in , down from 153 million for the sole democratic debate so far on a weeknight all of the republican debates have been on weeknights the first two attracted more than 23 million viewers each in fact none of the first four republican debates had an audience of less than 135 million the fifth debate had an estimated audience of 18 million the republican events certainly have seductions that the democratic ones do n't there are many more brawlers onstage , fanning out in a motley conga line there s trump he could say anything , degrade anyone , spontaneously combust and while bernie sanders and martin o'malley will again try to put hillary clinton on the defensive when the three appear together at st anselm college in goffstown , nh , this weekend , their efforts wo n't carry the realityshow fascination of trump s republican adversaries trying to erasetrying to his surreal lead but the disparity in viewership is also a function of scheduling , and was thus predictable and obviously intended when the democratic debates were set up , party leaders assumed that hillary clinton would be their best candidate , put their chips on her and sought to make sure that some upstart did n't upset their plans or complicate things to a point where clinton would stagger into the general election all banged up bernie sanders complained martin o'malley cried foul so did one of the vice chairwomen of the democratic national committee , tulsi gabbard , who made a lot of public noise about the paucity of debates and the unwillingness of the head of the dnc , debbie wasserman schultz , to abide such dissent it was an ugly sideshow for a few days , then it blew over but we should n't be so quick to forgive and forget how the democratic party has behaved it prides itself on being the true champion of democracy , more vigilant than the republican party about the disenfranchisement of voters , more invested in and industrious about making sure that as many people as possible are drawn into the process then should n't it want its candidates on vivid , continuous display \? should n't it connect them with the largest audience that it can \? i'm surprised that i have n't heard more griping about this what i 've heard instead is the concern that if clinton indeed gets the nomination , she 'll enter the general election less battletested than she 'd be if she were facing stiffer primary competition and enduring a greater number of higherstakes debates maybe but a politician who s been through whitewater , travelgate , impeachment , an emotional 2008 campaign against barack obama and several benghazi inquisitions does n't strike me as someone who needs more battle experience or someone who s going to be surprised , cowed or disoriented by anything that a republican nominee throws at her clinton is more than adequately steeled the real danger for her is that she s become armor and a real vulnerability is that she s seen by voters as entrenched political royalty and thus distant too distant from those everyday americans she talked about so much at the start of her campaign that s one of the problems with the democratic debate schedule it smacks of special treatment , and clinton , who set up her own homebrewed email account as secretary of state , ca n't afford to keep giving voters the impression that normal rules do n't apply to her and the democratic party ca n't pretend that it s done the right thing here while these debates are n't as highminded as we 'd wish or as illuminating as we sometimes pretend , they 're an important piece of the puzzle of figuring out candidates , with a bit more spontaneity and surprise than many other facets of the modern campaign they deserve priority and prominence artichoke dip optional
lake buena vista , fla john hart likes to use the word create it is the essence of the job of general manager you are shaping an organization , making sure that it stands for something you want the impact of your leadership to last in his first job as general manager , hart felt the force of john schuerholz s creation the , under schuerholz , were the model franchise in the major leagues they won 14 division titles in a row and captured the 1995 world series over hart s cleveland indians hart , 66 , had created a powerhouse with the indians , a team that had been so hapless it inspired a slapstick hollywood comedy he pioneered the strategy of giving longterm contracts to young players , locking in costs while avoiding salary arbitration he also groomed a generation of young executives in cleveland and , later , with the texas rangers he made you feel important , said neal huntington , who worked under hart in cleveland and is now general manager of the pittsburgh pirates you wanted to do everything in your power to make sure you did your job to the best of your ability it s just his nature he s so charismatic , but it goes beyond that his knowledge , his passion for the game , his passion for people when you have a conversation with him it may even be about his grandkids , but you walk away from that conversation fired up this is how hart is viewed around baseball , and after stepping down in texas in 2005 , he kept a presence in the game he advised the rangers , offered analysis on mlb network and later advised the braves his legacy was secure , and his life was comfortable hart is a scratch golfer and lives near his two young grandchildren in windermere , fla he and his wife , sandy , have been married 45 years so why did hart upend all that to become the braves' general manager last october \? he was part of a search committee , with schuerholz \( now the team president \) and the hall of fame manager bobby cox but schuerholz said he had only one name on his wish list john was very persuasive , said hart , who signed a threeyear contract when i sat with my family and made the decision , i think it was the desire to come in and create , to have the ability to create something the brand needed some touches john shared that with me hart also lives close to the braves' spring training complex at walt disney world , which helped , and the team had two of his personal hallmarks in place a rising star as an assistant general manager and a core of young players signed to longterm contracts john coppolella , the assistant gm , is hart s presumed successor first baseman freddie freeman , shortstop andrelton simmons , closer craig kimbrel and starter julio teheran are the centerpiece players signed through the braves' move to a new ballpark in cobb county , ga , in 2017 the combination of john hart and john coppolella has been dynamic , absolutely dynamic , schuerholz said the work those two have done , in tandem , has been sensational schuerholz called hart a friend and said they shared important traits a clear sense of purpose in trade talks , thorough preparation and the selfassurance to foster a frontoffice environment that empowered young executives dayton moore , the kansas city royals' gm , learned under schuerholz huntington , texas' jon daniels and others learned from hart coppolella , 36 , is next in line he started in baseball as a yankees intern in tampa , fla , in 2000 , making so little money that he lived in a shady neighborhood and rented a secondfloor apartment , to minimize the risk of being robbed his duties included manning the phones at the minor league complex on sunday mornings george steinbrenner would call for messages at 11 55 invariably , there would be none , and coppolella would be dismissed for the day coppolella was first viewed as a candidate to be the braves' general manager , but said he understood it was better this way it might sound counterintuitive , but i'm actually really happy with the way it turned out , coppolella said the more involved we can have john hart and john schuerholz , the better off the braves are going to be , long term i 've got plenty of time i'm not in any hurry to be this or that i just want to make us better every day the braves are working on that they reached the playoffs in 2010 , 2012 and 2013 , but lavish contracts for several unproductive players helped lead to the firing of general manager frank wren last september the team staggered to a 2740 record in the second half , and it ranked fourth in the majors in strikeouts and second to last in the majors in runs , ahead of only san diego hart said he could have reloaded and made one more run with outfielders justin upton and jason heyward facing free agency instead , believing those players would leave anyway , he traded them , and outfielder evan gattis , to headline a series of moves that flooded the organization with prospects we sized up our competition around the league , hart said the nationals are in their perfect window right now the marlins are getting better if you 're going to take , if you will , sort of a regroup year , this would be a good one the braves chafe at the word rebuild we 're restarting , hart said and they may be right the rotation is respectable , led by teheran , mike minor , shelby miller and alex wood , and the braves added veteran hitters like nick markakis and alberto callaspo , hoping to diversify a swingandmiss offense the lineup remains unimposing , but the old one was not working , either and the braves believe their farm system has gone from one of the worst to one of the best keith law of in the majors they 're all nebulous , hart said of prospect rankings , but we definitely have impacted the system how that all plays out , i do n't know , but we have options now every deal , we got back young pitching we have a stable full of young players i feel good about it , absolutely schuerholz said that a recommitment to player development was the single most important factor in the braves' future success all teams acknowledge that , of course , but the braves , more than most , have lived it hart has too , in his past jobs , and he cited a revamped frontoffice infrastructure as critical to that goal he has new scouts , new instructors and a new challenge late in a proud career if you walk in every day and you 've got an inspired , empowered young group that s in there working , you 're going to have a blast every day you come in , hart said you 're going to be doing the heavy lifting and the work but you 're going to be enjoying it
washington last year , as the converted the righthanded starter jenrry mejia to a reliever , he would become anxious about not having a set schedule , about not knowing exactly when he would throw or enter games he feared he would get hurt again by that point , he had had tommy john surgery on his pitching elbow in 2011 , and surgery to remove bone spurs from the same elbow in 2013 it was understandable that he would be apprehensive as it turned out , his transition to a fulltime role in the bullpen was an emphatic success , with mejia saving 28 games and establishing himself as the mets' closer and sure enough , he did get hurt again , although this time it was not his elbow but a sports hernia , which was repaired last september when he reported to spring training this year , he appeared to be fully healed although he did not look particularly sharp in spring training , when performances by established players do n't mean all that much instead , the mets' injury concerns were elsewhere , with two other pitchers josh edgin and zack wheeler emerging with elbow ligament injuries that required tommy john surgery no one seemed particularly worried about mejia that is , until the mets' season opener in washington on monday , when mejia began warming up , felt tightness and pain in his throwing elbow and never entered the game in his absence , buddy carlyle , a journeyman reliever , picked up the save in the mets' 31 victory over the nationals on tuesday , after putting mejia through tests in new york that included xrays and a magnetic resonance imaging exam , the mets announced that he had posterior inflammation in his right elbow he received a cortisone shot , was told not to pitch competitively for at least 10 days and was placed on the 15day disabled list , retroactive to sunday given the alternative still another announcement that still another mets pitcher had been found to have a tear in his elbow requiring tommy john surgery the news had to be considered somewhat encouraging for the mets a person in baseball with knowledge of the mejia situation went further than the team statement , maintaining that no structural damage was found in mejia s elbow left unclear , however , was whether mejia , 25 , might need further testing when the inflammation presumably subsides who could blame the mets if they had feared the worst on tuesday \? in the last two years , five pitchers on their major league staff have required tommy john surgery edgin , wheeler , matt harvey , bobby parnell and jeremy hefner and mejia had the surgery four years ago with mejia sidelined , the mets are missing a large majority of their top relievers edgin is out until next season parnell , who had tommy john surgery in april 2014 , is carefully working his way back to a spot on the roster , perhaps by the end of the month and vic black , who is still out with shoulder weakness , is hoping to be back relatively soon jeurys familia , the last man standing , will presumably fill in as the mets' closer erik goeddel has been called up from the minors to take mejia s roster spot as for the mets , after tuesday s day off , they will take on the nationals with backtoback marquee pitching matchups that will have tommy john surgery as a subtext on wednesday , it will be jacob degrom versus jordan zimmermann , and on thursday , matt harvey will make his first start since 2013 against none other than stephen strasburg all four are considered elite pitchers , and all four serve as reminders of the , and surgery , among major league pitchers zimmermann had the operation in 2009 and has made two allstar games since then degrom had the surgery in 2010 , and last season he emerged as the national league rookie of the year strasburg had the surgery in 2010 , too , and has since blossomed into a bona fide ace and harvey was probably the best pitcher in baseball in 2013 until his elbow gave out although it wo n't read that way in the box score , those two days , in effect , will be tommy john vs tommy john vs tommy john vs tommy john that s baseball in 2015
not so long ago , spain seemed to be a rising power in the sport had long been nearly invisible in the country , generating little public interest , but then suddenly last decade there were several drivers , one of whom would become a twotime world champion two grands prix races , one in and one in a growing number of sponsors a spanish team and the series had risen to be among the top two or three most popular sports in spain and then at the end of the decade it all fell apart , as than many other countries in the european union the number of spanish drivers was reduced to one the double world champion fernando alonso as the valencia race dropped off the calendar for financial reasons , the spanish team went bankrupt , and sponsors disappeared , with the exception of , one of the few spanish banks to escape the worst of the banking crisis now , however , there are three spanish drivers on the grid this season this turn of events does not seem to be an indication of spain s return as a formula one power , though instead , it is a result of the past racing boom two of the young drivers climbed through the ranks on the tails of that boom , reaching maturity to race in formula one this year at the beginning of a new era for spanish drivers the third current driver , alonso , 33 , has been in the series since 2001 and is arguably nearing the end of an era but since his last title in 2006 , a question mark has hung over alonso s career an answer may be provided this year after five years at ferrari , where he failed to win his third title but finished second in the series three times , , a oncegreat team that is now at its lowest level in decades with mclaren and the honda engine manufacturer starting a new relationship , the season has so far been the driver s worst since he started in formula one in 2001 at the minardi team the two other drivers , carlos sainz jr , 20 , and roberto merhi , 24 , drive for the toro rosso and manor teams , respectively each has followed a unique career path that is unlike alonso s sainz is the son of the former world rally champion carlos sainz , and he grew up in the world of rally racing but he said that it was thanks to alonso that he had decided to become a formula one racing driver it was just because i saw fernando alonso on television and i fell in love with formula one , sainz said he was my hero at that time in 2005 , winning the world championship , and i said , i want to be like fernando alonso' so it was that he turned to karting and openwheel racing , later being picked up by the red bull young driver program this year he was hired to race alongside max verstappen , the 17yearold son of the former formula one driver jos verstappen sainz won the formula renault 35 racing series last year , with merhi giving him a strong challenge for the title and finishing third merhi s father is of lebanese origin and his mother is spanish , but merhi was born and raised in spain he said that unlike sainz s , his racing career had not been influenced by alonso i started before he was in formula one i knew i wanted to do this before alonso was a world champion , merhi said i know so many people started in spain because of alonso so many spanish people said , i want my kid to be the next alonso' but it s not my case obviously i saw his results when i was young , but it is nothing to do with my reason i started gokarting in 1998 and he came to formula one in 2001 his father , who runs a ceramics business , practiced amateur racing he bought his two sons a gokart when they were children , and roberto , the youngest , showed immediate talent and an interest , unlike his older brother although his karting and early carracing career began in spain , he ended up racing in the european formula 3 series for the english manor team in 2009 , moving to different teams the subsequent years and winning the title in 2011 in 2012 he was taken on in the mercedes junior team , with michael schumacher as a mentor , and raced two seasons in the german touring car series , dtm last year he was a test driver at the caterham team this year his old formula 3 team , manor , now in formula one , took him into the team merhi said he believed that this was the reason the three spaniards are in the series for their talent , not by happenstance or personal finances he also pointed out that while the racing culture in spain comes mainly from catalonia , centered around the barcelona circuit , none of the current crop of drivers is from there the previous spaniards in the series were all from catalonia marc gen from sabadell and pedro de la rosa and jaime alguersuari from barcelona merhi is from near valencia , alonso is from oviedo and sainz is from madrid alonso , meanwhile , said that he was not inspired by any spanish drivers as he grew up racing karts in spain , but rather by the mclaren cars and the team s famous driver , ayrton senna , who died in a crash at imola , italy , in 1994 alonso won his titles in 2005 and 2006 while driving for renault , but now , after having finished in second place in the championship several times , he said that he had returned to mclaren where he raced one season , in 2007 for the challenge of lifting the team back to the top i'm one of the happiest people in the world , he said at his first race this season , in malaysia in march i have a challenge in front of me a tough challenge , clearly i think it s difficult but it s going to taste better when we do it i grew up watching tv with mclarenhonda domination and ayrton senna in the cockpit , he added i understand that we are now too far back and we will be heavily criticized and it will be fair to receive that criticism because we are not at the level we will be since then , race by race , alonso has indeed been improving the mclaren , and few in the paddock believe that the team and driver will remain at the back of the grid for long for the moment , however , one of alonso s greatest fans , sainz , is surprised to be getting better results than his idol it is a very weird situation for me , sainz said but once you put your helmet on you forget about all those things if i want to overtake him or he overtakes me , even if we crash he will still be my hero , he added , especially from when i was a young age , and he is still my reference as a driver now
west point , ny sasha vujacic is all about the journey these days he cites the journey from his backyard in slovenia , where he attempted shot after shot on a slab of concrete and his journey to the los angeles lakers , for whom he filled gaps as a shooting guard on two championship teams and his more recent journey back to europe , where he played for clubs in turkey , italy and spain i was on a journey , he said , and i enjoyed the journey vujacic seems to catalog his many journeys as separate journeys that make up one grand journey , destination unknown his latest journey \? a fresh start in the nba with the , where two familiar faces derek fisher , a former teammate , and , his former coach hope he can provide leadership and guidance , a change from his early days with the lakers once i heard about what s going on here , vujacic said here at training camp , i wanted to be part of the journey vujacic , 31 , who signed a oneyear deal in august for the veteran s minimum of 14 million , was a lowcost , lowrisk addition to the knicks grateful to be back in the nba , he said he would do whatever fisher , the team s coach , asked of him vujacic has another clear advocate in jackson , who , as team president , has emphasized the need for improved chemistry this season he has a real understanding of what we 're trying to accomplish , jackson said he has the energy and the grit that we like about his game none of this is to suggest that vujacic will be a transcendent force largely absent from the nba since 2011 he had a 10day contract with the los angeles clippers in february 2014 vujacic is a known quantity at this stage of his career , having made his living as a reliable 3point threat but as the knicks seek to ascend from the depths of last season s sinkhole , they could use a few guys who offer stability everybody on our team is a piece of the puzzle , vujacic said the welltraveled vujacic seems to carry himself with the quiet confidence of a selfhelp guru when a reporter from china asked vujacic a question at the team s media day last week , vujacic prefaced his response by offering his greetings ni hao , he said vujacic said he had come a long way since he was drafted by the lakers in 2004 , at age 20 he had his most productive season in 20078 , when he averaged 88 points in 178 minutes a game his contributions gradually waned , though , and he averaged just 28 points in limited minutes during the 200910 season i'm a little bit wiser now , he said vujacic , who described himself as just a kid when he played for the lakers , recalled looking up to fisher , then one of the team s sage voices nobody on the lakers , vujacic said , worried about the future that awaited fisher once his playing career ended he always carried himself as if he were in charge their lockers were close to each other , separated by the one that belonged to kobe bryant interesting , right \? vujacic said after a brief stint with the nets , vujacic signed with a team in turkey at the start of the nba labor lockout in 2011 he did not necessarily want to leave for europe i was young and impatient , he said but i have no regrets about it in recent months , vujacic bounced around europe , playing for reyer venezia mestre \( italy \) , laboral kutxa \( spain \) and istanbul buyuksehir belediyespor \( turkey \) , whose season concluded in june vujacic maintains a residence in los angeles , where he lives near his younger brother , aljosa bjekovic , a senior forward at the university of redlands , a division iii program in southern california he s taking that journey seriously , vujacic said i'm excited for him vujacic s enthusiasm appears contagious among the knicks he pointed to several teammates who were waiting for him to wrap up an interview so they could resume their postpractice set of planks , an abdominal exercise i'm destroying our plank time , vujacic said they 're kind of mad because plank time is postponed a couple of minutes vujacic , who works with a trainer every offseason , said he had learned to take care of his body he said he felt fit more fit , in fact , than he felt when he first left for europe he dismissed the suggestion that he might be susceptible to the toll of age and experience i 've heard being in your early 30s is your prime for a guard , he said i feel very , very young , to be honest with you fisher said vujacic had been impressive in camp when the team scrimmaged toward the end of thursday s practice , vujacic settled into a rhythm he sank two 3pointers and a pullup jumper before dropping a crafty bounce pass to lou amundson for a layup he s much more of a leader than he was when we played together , fisher said i think he s helped a lot of our guys to feel more comfortable with what we 're trying to do offensively , because sasha recognizes where the shots are , what kind of plays can be made you should shoot the ball and you should n't be secondguessing yourself just go out and play with some confidence vujacic said that these were the lessons gleaned from long years in the sport he has returned to the nba , he said , with greater perspective and more appreciation every journey has ups and downs , he said it s your decision you can stay stuck in the moment and start blaming everyone around you that things are not going your way , or you can work hard and you can go where you want to go vujacic has made his choice another adventure awaits
there is a moment in weekend of a champion , a 1972 documentary film about the racing driver jackie stewart , in which the legendary team owner ken tyrrell pushes stewart s car along the pitlane in monaco tyrrell had founded his grand prix team in a woodshed on the grounds of his family lumber business , and he went on to become a highly successful team principal , eventually selling the team in 1997 that team was the basis for the one that would grow into the mercedes team through transformations from a team called bar , to honda , to brawn that is dominating the series today but the job of team principal at mercedes , occupied today by toto wolff under the title of executive director , could not be any further from the post that tyrrell held in 1972 in fact , although the title of team principal still exists at the 10 teams that will fill out the grid at the singapore grand prix this weekend , the job it now designates has more to do with that of highflying chief executives of the international business world than of the humble operations such as tyrrell pushing his own racing car today s formula one team principals are a disparate lot among them are a female lawyer , a liquor company magnate , a marketing executive , former racers , financial investors and even one or two engineers but as the staffs of teams have grown , from less than a dozen people to nearly a 1 , 000 , the role has evolved from the initial handson approach to racing to that of chief executive of a midsize company , managing the team , chasing sponsorship , and hiring and firing directors the principal nowadays has almost nothing to do with actual race strategy the biggest change , according to john booth , the team principal of the manor team , is that , unlike in the past , none of the team principals today personally own the teams outright i was in a meeting with team principals and we were trying to make a decision on engines , booth said , and i said , the first thing we need to do before we make a decision is consult with the people who pay the bills , because there is no one sitting around this table that pays the bills' that is the biggest shift today , the teams are owned by car manufacturers , private investment companies , or shareholders the mclaren team is even halfowned by the government of bahrain this trend has led to a change in the job of managing the team , with a corresponding shift in image from the macho male racer to the chief executive that made it possible for monisha kaltenborn to become the first female team principal in the series in 2012 there is nothing where you can really directly go into it and say , do this , do that , get your car in at this time , ' this is there for the experts , kaltenborn said , describing the job but to manage all of these people working together in an environment which is very quick and highly emotional , it is managing these emotions amongst all of the experts you have , particularly on track , or all of your heads of departments , because they can be equally emotional , without being on the track she said the biggest difference today was that the team was a midsize company and had to be managed like one the job also involves diversifying the racing enterprise and the company through other businesses , like selling the team s technology expertise and aerodynamic services , for example claire williams , the daughter of frank williams , founder of the williams team , is deputy team principal to her father a team principal of the traditional sense has moved , she said you had this one kind of icon in the team , who was the beall and endall , and that has changed following the change in the size of our businesses in formula one , as all teams have grown exponentially you have to have a very strong management group around you , whether that s a board , an executive committee or a team of senior managers , she added williams said the biggest challenge for her at the moment was seeking out sponsorship money , especially in these difficult financial times but while williams has to report to the shareholders of what is now a publicly traded company , at mercedes , wolff is more concerned about his dealings with the car company behind the team mercedes recognizes that in this sport a team is more like a midsize company , and it does n't function if you try to impose a corporate structure like a multinational giant , wolff told the international automobile federation s magazine , auto but at the same time , we know we represent the brand i like the analogy that they leave us a very long leash we never feel it as a tension around our necks , but we know it s there but at ferrari , the most successful and iconic team in the series , which is owned by fiat , the concern is less about sponsorship money than it is about trying to win the team s first drivers' title since 2007 last year at ferrari , two successive team principals were fired , and the replacement in charge today , maurizio arrivabene , came from a decadeslong career as a marketing executive with the philip morris company , where he had experience with the ferrari sponsorship contract some people questioned how a team director with no engineering or racing background could do the job i think in formula one , a team principal needs to be first of all a manager , arrivabene said to put the people together , to make sure that everybody is going in the same direction , to find the right balance in between , and sometimes to take decisions here and at home you do n't need to be an engineer but for booth , who has made a career out of running and owning racing teams , having an understanding of racing is essential for a principal in my personal position , i see myself really as the director of racing , he said i have a board of directors on which i sit and a 100 percent owner , and the board takes the real decisions about the company , together with the owner my real job is implementing what happens here at the circuit and preparing for it i think it is important to have an understanding of people in racing , and racing people , he added
midway into a threeandahalfhour congressional hearing this week featuring mary jo white , the chairwoman of the securities and exchange commission , none of the legislators had bothered to ask if or when her agency would require that corporations disclose their political spending the bipartisan silence testified to the growing importance to both parties of anonymous campaign donations with each passing year since 2010 , when the supreme court s decision in citizens united opened the floodgates to secretive political giving , politicians appear to value socalled dark money more and value disclosure of unnamed donors less the issue was finally broached by representative michael capuano , democrat of massachusetts he observed that shareholders have a right to know how corporate cash is spent , and demanded to know why the sec has not required disclosure ms white gave the same answer she has given since she became chairwoman in 2013 essentially , that the agency is too busy with more important issues since then , however , the sec has added new issues to its agenda , while neglecting to put politicalspending disclosure on its todo list the omission is indefensible , because the investors' need to know will only grow as the level of anonymous giving rises in 2012 , 63 billion was spent on presidential and congressional elections estimates for spending in the 2016 contest run between 75 billion and 8 billion much of the spending is disclosed , but the portion that is dark is certain to expand for example , the network run by the koch brothers which is constructed chiefly of groups that are not required to reveal their donors has of nearly 900 million for the 2016 races , compared with 400 million in 2012 another reason for the sec to act is that investors are clamoring for disclosure via petitions and letters to the sec and via the filing of shareholder resolutions several papers bolster the case for disclosure in the meantime , president obama has also come under pressure to force disclosure of corporate political spending recently , 50 public advocacy groups called on the president to issue an executive order requiring such disclosure by corporations that receive federal contracts he should issue such an order without delay , not only because it is the right thing to do for transparency , but because doing so would set a needed example for ms white , corporate leaders and anyone else in a position to provide investors with the disclosure they want and deserve
at first glance , it seems a simple thing this year , christie s has decided to hold its impressionist and modern art evening auction in the second week of may , not the first , as it usually does but this change in the traditional new york auction calendar has set off a chain of reactions , with some artmarket insiders applauding the move and others suggesting that it threatens to be disruptive the only evening sale during the first week of may , traditionally the opening of the spring auction season in manhattan , will be an auction of impressionist and modern art at sotheby s on may 5 but the second auction week will be quite crowded there will be five evening auctions , beginning monday , may 11 , with a special christie s evening sale that includes modern and contemporary art on thursday , may 14 , there will be two auctions on the same night , creating a rare conflict for collectors who want to attend the christie s impressionism and modern art sale at 5 30 pm and still make it to a phillips sale of contemporary art at 7 pm fatigue may have set in by then , but it is very hard to predict , said david nash , a new york gallerist and former sotheby s executive christie s said that it made the move to stage its contemporary and modern sales in the same week in order to avoid a clash with the venice biennale , the annual art exhibition in italy that draws many collectors , and added that the change would accommodate those who pursue art from several periods , a group that the auction house says is a growing sector of the market it is very much what collectors are doing today , jussi pylkkanen , global president of christie s , said they are looking at 100 years of art rather than 50 he added , it is a generational shift sotheby s said it saw no reason to change the date of its impressionism and modern art sale , even though it will now be the only night auction that week sotheby s will hold its contemporary auction a week afterward , as usual we are looking forward to a busy exhibition period and a full salesroom on the night of may 5 , said simon shaw , cohead of the sotheby s impressionist and modern art department richard l feigen , a manhattan dealer , said that the rescheduling made sense to accommodate foreign buyers who want to visit new york for a shorter period of time , and added that he , too , was seeing a real smudging in the line between modern and contemporary in collectors' tastes i can understand people buying a picasso might also be in the market for a rothko , mr feigen said some experts wonder whether buyers will bother to show up for the first week , even though there will be a schedule of day sales , while others worry that collectors may not be in a buying mood by the end of the second the christie s auction of impressionist and modern art had originally been scheduled for the first week of may , and that was still the plan when specialists for the auction house secured some of their finest consignments , including the collection of goldman sachs executive john c whitehead , who died in february , which includes works by modigliani and monet but achim moeller , the new york dealer who advised mr whitehead and his estate , said he was not concerned by the auction s move to the second week it was a good idea to do so , because you are going to have an entire week dedicated to evening sales , and that of course will draw a lot of attention from the international world onto christie s , he said people who focus on monday , tuesday and wednesday will also focus on thursday he added you ca n't tell me that if sotheby s has a monet the week before that the potential buyers of monet will not also look at monet on thursday very often people are on the phone anyway christie s said it had consulted with all consignors before changing the date , and none had withdrawn their works michael plummer , a principal and cofounder of artvest partners , an art advisory company , said crosscollecting was a trend that justified the shift by christie s he has organized an art fair , spring masters , that is based on the same concept the fair , at the park avenue armory from may 812 , will feature dealers selling works spanning some 2 , 000 years a firstcentury roman bust alongside 14thcentury italian paintings and 21stcentury works mr plummer said that of late , older works have typically been undervalued as the industry has obsessed over the boom in contemporary art people buy across periods , he said rather than spending half a million dollars on a piece of sculpture that is 10 years old , you can spend a similar amount or less on something 2 , 000 years old
jerusalem the morning of the attack , subhe abu khalifa did not get up for work , telling his mother he was too tired and his feet hurt he had spent the night watching and rewatching footage of a woman , who the israeli police say stabbed a jewish man in the back in jerusalem s old city , being harassed and shot instead of going to his job as an apprentice electrician , mr khalifa , 19 , sharpened a knife he bought the day before , according to an account friends later gave his brother , then plunged it into an israeli near police headquarters with that , he joined a cadre of young who , spurred on by social media , have independently decided to attack israelis , killing seven and wounding scores in two dozen episodes since oct 1 , authorities said the violence escalated again on tuesday , with two deadly outbreaks in jerusalem , one where the police said two palestinians tried to commandeer a public bus with a gun three israelis were killed along with at least two of three palestinian attackers palestinian officials said 30 of their people had been slain this month , mostly after stabbings or in roiling clashes across east jerusalem and the , as well as at the border fence separating from the  what we see now is like an octopus with many hands but no brain , said orit perlov , an expert on arab social media at the institute for national security studies in tel aviv you do n't need something sophisticated we 're talking about 15yearold boys you just write the word it'an , ' stab in arabic , and then whoever has a knife in his house and wants to go , that s it the current violent uprising has a very different character than the second palestinian intifada , whose suicide bombings were orchestrated by wellorganized armed groups it consists of spontaneous outbursts by individual young people unaffiliated with any formal political movement their weapons are mainly small knives , but also screwdrivers and even a potato peeler and their inspiration seems to come from their ubiquitous smartphones , which provide an endless stream of videos like the one mr khalifa viewed over and over before he struck these leaderless assailants live in communities that applaud those who have died , often without any mention of their own violent deeds they are motivated by some by hamas and other militant islamist movements , many by enraged individuals replete with glistening blades and howto guides further fanning the flames are viral videos also broadcast by of israelis fatally shooting attackers , whose names are immediately added to the facebook scroll of socalled martyrs the clarion call is the defense of al aqsa , the mosque at the heart of a contested old city compound that palestinian leaders continue to insist israel wants to divide , despite the prime minister s insistence otherwise israel has struggled to try to quell the attacks through everstricter tactics , only to find that its crackdown has fueled a sisyphean cycle when troops stormed the shuafat camp after mr khalifa s attack , for example , they faced an unruly mob of men , some of them armed , and killed one of his neighbors two days later another shuafat man stabbed two israeli police officers and was also shot dead another riot exploded in the camp there s a viral nature to these attacks one person goes out , they get killed , then they get glorified , it makes other people want to go out , said daniel nisman , president of the levantine group , an israeli security analysis firm you have a significant number of people who are willing to basically commit suicide attacks they just do n't have access to sophisticated weapons fourteen of 23 alleged assailants since oct 3 were 20 or younger , and one was just 13 , according to a levantine group compilation of police reports at least 16 of the 23 , like mr khalifa , are from east jerusalem , where the palestinian authority has no presence and residents complain of severe neglect by israeli institutions one crude cartoon making the rounds on facebook , including on the official palestinian tv page before it disappeared late tuesday , depicts an israeli soldier as an ape , accompanied by a pig , over a bloodied youth another has a closeup of a menacing blade , and is captioned this is not difficult to the closest kitchen , and go in the name of god an israeli security official said that except for the alleged perpetrators of tuesday s jerusalem attacks , and five hamas members arrested in connection with the fatal shooting of an israeli couple in front of their four children on oct 1 , none of the recent suspects were affiliated with any known group or had ever been previously arrested most were not religious , the official said on the condition of anonymity under his agency s rules , noting that none of the men wore beards , as is common for devout muslims they decided to act the morning of the stabbing or maximum a day or two before , he added , giving security forces zero chance to prevent it ms perlov , the arab social media expert , said israeli and palestinian security services had arrested hundreds of online instigators in recent months , but that it had done little good because ideas are becoming immortal you can take down pages but it will multiply itself in retrospect , muhanad halabi s relatives said they should have seen something coming mr halabi , a 19yearold law student at al quds university , had been morose since the sept 22 death of his friend dia talahma , 21 , who the israeli military said died when a grenade he was throwing at troops in the occupied detonated too early mr halabi replaced his profile picture with one of mr talahma his mother , suheir halabi , said that on oct 2 , her son was n't normal , explaining , he always says good night , but the night before he made sure to come and kiss me , he kissed my hand and he asked me , do you love me , mom \? ' the next morning , mr halabi kissed his brother , mostafa , 10 , asking if he was upset about anything , then stopped to visit his ailing grandmother before heading to the university on campus , he spoke at a rally he said we need to stand with our sisters who are being attacked at the aqsa , we need to defend it , a cousin , mahmoud , said people there told him he was telling the people i'm promising you something a few hours later , mr halabi fatally stabbed two orthodox men in the old city and wounded one of their wives and 2yearold son before being shot dead on facebook , he is now admired as the lion , or the thunder that unleashed the new uprising mustafa alkhateeb , in contrast , never posted anything that had to do with al aqsa or anything political , according to his aunt , bakriya alkhateeb bakri , 41 , who was also his facebook friend mr alkhateeb , 18 , a senior at the private ibrahimi school , recently changed his profile picture to show him next to a shiny mercedesbenz he was shot dead on monday by israeli police officers after trying to stab one of them , according to the israeli authorities , who said the officer was unharmed because he wore a protective vest but ms bakri insisted that they shot mustafa for no reason whatsoever , like they have been doing to every other palestinian lately saeb erekat , the chief palestinian negotiator , said at a news conference on tuesday that israel was carrying out extrajudicial executions and listed the names and ages of each slain palestinian among them was ishaq badran , 16 , who was sprayed with seven bullets , witnesses said , after he stabbed a man in the face saturday on a cobblestone curve of cafe tables outside the old city several palestinians said they encouraged ishaq to flee after the stabbing , but he seemed desperate to die dramatically i tried to hold him so he would n't do anything else , said a man who works at a juice stand and spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals i told him go , go , and he does n't want to he was just holding the knife in his hand he said , i want to be a martyr' the next evening , scores of men and boys mourned at ishaq s home , wearing freshly made pendants and palestine scarves with his picture his father , qasem badran , said ishaq , too , was agitated by the video of the female stabber shot earlier in the old city he came to his mother and he was crying , he opened his cellphone and showed the video , said mr badran , 40 he said , look , mom , what they 're doing to the muslim girls and no one is standing up for them' the woman in the video is shorouq dweiyat , 18 , who is a firstyear student at bethlehem university , where relatives said she started a campaign last tuesday encouraging students to donate 10 shekels , or about 250 , to families of the martyrs on wednesday , they said , she was running late for class and decided to go instead for breakfast in the old city and pray at al aqsa the israeli police said that ms dweiyat stabbed a jewish man in the upper back , near his head , and that he pulled out his personal pistol and shot her she tried to escape and within seconds policemen were able to pounce on her , a commander , avraham peled , said at the scene we stopped her , searched her , identified she was hurt and saw that she put a knife down next to her we found another knife in her bag the knives cannot be seen in the video that palestinians like mr khalifa , the electrician from the shuafat camp , kept showing one another the videos have been removed from social networks , but many palestinians said israelis were seen yanking at ms dweiyat s veil and long coat before the alleged attack mohammed abu khalifa , 28 , said that after seeing the video , his brother posted on facebook about al aqsa , telling people to wake up , our sisters are having their clothes ripped off the next morning , before sharpening his knife and hunting for an israeli , mohammed added , subhe put on facebook that he s planning on following the footsteps of all the martyrs he did not fulfill that wish , instead getting arrested without injury he smiled broadly for the smartphone cameras , an image that was also celebrated on social networks
minneapolis the police on wednesday released the names of four men arrested in connection with a shooting during a black lives matter protest outside a police station that injured five protesters the shooting , during the ninth day of protests demanding action against two white minneapolis police officers involved in the fatal shooting of jamar clark , 24 , an unarmed black man , on nov 15 none of the wounded protesters had lifethreatening injuries , the authorities said on wednesday , protesters paused for the first time as mr clark s funeral was held , and hundreds gathered to commemorate him at shiloh temple international ministries , calling for a day of peace the authorities identified the suspects in the shooting as allen lawrence scarsella , 23 nathan gustavsson , 21 daniel macey , 26 and joseph backman , 27 all are white and were arrested in the minneapolis area the police also detained a 32yearold hispanic man , but he was released after questioning the four men are being held at the hennepin county jail and have yet to be charged the day after the shooting , mr scarsella posted a confederate banner known as the bonnie blue flag at the top of his facebook page a video posted on youtube showed a swat team arresting him at his house in a minneapolis suburb later in the day the racial tension at the protests began to grow after a video was posted online last week showing two lightskinned men saying they planned to go to the protest to make the fire rise in the video , which was posted on a black lives matter facebook page to alert members , two young men in masks and military fatigues were driving in a car the driver identified himself as saigamarine , and his passenger as blackpowerranger we 're locked and loaded , saigamarine told the camera as he brandished a pistol referring to protesters using a racial slur , he said the pair planned to visit the protest to do a little bit of reverse cultural enriching we are going to make the fire rise , he said he then ended the video by urging viewers to stay white saigamarine and blackpowerranger are also names used by people who posted regularly on the anonymous online forum 4chan one comment thread in which they participated included derogatory references to minorities , talk of starting a race war and disparaging remarks on the black lives matter protest in minneapolis two men wearing what appear to be the same masks and jackets as saigamarine and blackpowerranger also show up in a video taken by members of the alternative media site unicorn riot last week in it , an interviewer mistakes the two men for supporters of the protests the pair chat jovially with the interviewer while slipping in , seemingly unnoticed , references to a 4chan group saigamarine again refers to a race war , saying it s boiling , man it s going to happen soon we 're here to watch the fire rise demonstrators who later saw both videos said they told the police they had spotted the same men at the protests monday when the men showed up , protesters said they told them to remove their masks and confronted them shortly later , the shootings occurred after the arrests , posters on 4chan generally condemned the men s actions after the details emerged not because they had wounded five people , but largely because they thought the shootings would bring unwanted attention to their group this is going to be full on 4chan k is a terrorist breeding ground with proven ties to racist white extremist groups , one posted , referring to a subgroup on 4chan that usually focuses on firearms you deserve everything that happens once the cable news networks start putting it on the air
critical acclaim for the vital performances and typically adventurous programming of the periodinstrument , founded and directed by thomas crawford , often comes with a sensible suggestion it is high time that the ensemble scrap its longstanding motto , music as the masters heard it past time , in fact we know enough about early music by now to realize how much we do n't and ca n't know about the precise circumstances of original performances the quality of the playing , for example , or the sounds of the halls and , all that aside , the masters were listening with ears innocent of the two or three centuries' worth of music to follow the motto seemed singularly ludicrous for the concert opening the orchestra s 31st season on thursday evening at alice tully hall the program consisted entirely of works beethoven wrote as he was sinking into deafness the leonore overture no 3 \( 1806 \) , the emperor piano concerto \( 1809 \) and the seventh symphony \( 1813 \) he heard next to none of it an allbeethoven concert is not exactly adventurous programming , of course , but the orchestra s season also includes telemann s oratorio der tag des gerichts \( the day of judgment \) , bach s st john passion and , semistaged , haydn s opera l'isola disabitata \( the deserted island \) nor is largescale beethoven on period instruments entirely routine yet in new york the overture immediately opened the ears with delightfully crunchy sounds from the treacherous old valveless brasses and it was a nice idea by mr crawford to relegate the work s distant trumpet call \( heralding florestan s liberation in the opera \) to the rear balcony , where timothy will gave it a good go even more revelatory was hearing the mighty emperor concerto , generally pounded out on heavy steelframe pianos these days , played on a fortepiano , by the young chineseborn the instrument was a replica of an instrument built in vienna by johann fritz in 1812 it was recently made by paul mcnulty , an american living in the czech republic , for the fortepianist malcolm bilson , one of mr sun s teachers mr sun exploited the instrument s delicate yet lush sonority with flowing legatos and characterful phrasing the fortissimo low chords in the finale had a nice stringy twang rather than a metallic clang mr sun played along with orchestral passages where no piano was called for , duplicating the harmonies to little audible effect , but adding an energy that was palpable the orchestra s playing throughout the evening , driven hard by mr crawford , was a little rough and ready , especially in the horns but allowances can be made so early in the season , and this was , over all , an invigorating start

a decade after he began using a republican party credit card for personal purchases like paving stones at his home , senator marco rubio on wednesday pledged to disclose new spending records from that account as he sought to inoculate himself against what could be his biggest liability as a presidential candidate how he manages his finances the decision to release the records highlights the enduring potency of a controversy rooted in mr rubio s days as a young state representative in florida that he and his aides thought had been put to rest with his 2010 election to the senate his use of the card for a family reunion , flights and groceries was a recurring issue in that campaign but as his presidential campaign experiences a surge in the polls , mr rubio s rivals are rushing to resurrect the matter in an attempt to portray him as a careless manager of money , despite mr rubio s assurances that he paid for every personal purchase himself a super pac supporting hillary rodham clinton demanded to know wednesday why mr rubio was waiting so long to release the records , wondering , what is he hiding \? fearing that mr rubio could surpass him in polls , donald j trump has started to mock mr rubio s use of the party account , calling him a disaster with his credit cards and suggesting that the senator struggled to live within his means he has a very bad record of finances , mr trump said jeb bush all but encouraged the news media to pursue the issue wednesday , highlighting his own voluminous financial disclosures and suggesting that scrutiny of mr rubio s handling of money was entirely reasonable the risk for mr rubio , who has acknowledged a lack of bookkeeping skills , is that the credit card may become a symbol of a larger pattern of financial challenges in his recent past , including a brush with foreclosure on a second home in 2010 over late mortgage payments and the recent liquidation of a retirement account that prompted a large tax penalty mr rubio on wednesday played down the importance of the credit card and fended off questions about his finances , portraying himself as an everyday american who can relate to the struggles of the electorate i obviously don t come from a wealthy family , he said in an interview on abc s good morning america mr rubio , 44 , has long argued that the credit card arrangement appears worse than it actually was he used his republican card , he said , largely for political expenses , which were covered by donations to the party but from time to time , a few personal expenses were charged to the card as well , he wrote in his memoir , an american son every time , he said , he identified the personal purchases and ultimately paid for them himself he wrote a monthly check to the credit card company to cover the personal costs , and the party wrote a check to cover the political ones , according to his staff nevertheless , in hindsight , mr rubio wrote of the personal expenses , i wish that none of them had ever been charged even so , during his 2010 senate campaign mr rubio refused to release the full records of his charges on the card , issued by american express , calling it an internal party matter that , according to florida political observers , was a squandered chance to put the issue behind him the interest is alive and well , because the issue was never resolved , peter butzin , the chairman of common cause of florida , a nonpartisan government watchdog , said wednesday in an interview it never really came to a conclusion it raised a lot of eyebrows at the time i m not surprised it is coming up again mr butzin called the renewed scrutiny of mr rubio s credit card use fair game questions about personal finances have bedeviled several candidates in the 2016 presidential field , highlighting their vast differences in wealth and in how they earned that income mr bush has raised eyebrows by earning millions from companies that did business with the state of florida while he was governor mrs clinton has unsettled liberals by taking generous speaking fees from big banks that she would regulate if she became president and mr trump has drawn unwanted attention for relying on bankruptcy protections when his investments in casinos have faltered mr rubio has at times seemed defensive about his finances during the last republican presidential debate , he batted away a question about his financial bookkeeping as a litany of discredited attacks from democrats and my political opponents but on wednesday , his tone seemed to shift during the abc interview pressed on the credit card issue , mr rubio spoke in detail about when he used it and how he identified costs that were personal or political if there was a personal expense , i paid it if it was a party expense , the party paid it , mr rubio said he added , but the republican party never paid a single expense of mine personal expense to clear the air , mr rubio said he would release new records in the next few weeks a top rubio campaign aide said , our plan has always been to release these marco is running for president and thinks the public has a right to know , the aide , todd harris , said wednesday in an interview and we have nothing to hide the senator is expected to disclose charges on the card in 2005 to 2006 records covering late 2006 to 2008 became public through leaks to the news media during his senate campaign a time when florida s republican party was facing questions about its financial oversight mr rubio has said that he charged more than 16 , 000 in personal expenses on the card in 2007 and 2008 he has not divulged his total spending on the card in the abc interview , mr rubio said the card was not a credit card , as many have referred to it , in the past and more recently it was an american express charge card secured under my personal credit in conjunction with the party , mr rubio said but this appears to be a change in language by mr rubio in his memoir , mr rubio described the card as an american express business credit card \( mr harris said that in the book , mr rubio had simply adopted a colloquial description of the card , but said it was , in fact , a charge card \) on wednesday , mr rubio described how he would check for personal expenses on the card , which he said he would pay for himself , without suggesting that such purchases were accidents in his memoir , mr rubio twice referred to such charges as mistakes in one , he said , i pulled the wrong card from my wallet to pay for pavers in another , he said , his travel agent mistakenly used the card to pay for a family reunion in georgia mr rubio seems determined to confront the questions about his finances with aplomb , chuckling at the critique from mr trump , for example , and explaining his decision to cash out a retirement account in folksy language that any warmweather voter would appreciate mr rubio said that among other things , he wanted the money to guard against unexpected breakdowns in essential appliances like airconditioners that s a crisis in south florida , he said jonathan martin and jeremy w peters contributed reporting
i wrote my column last weekend on the muchdiscussed anne case angus deaton paper on rising white mortality rates , and since then there s been an important emendation to their data from columbia s andrew gelman in a nutshell , gelman argues that a finergrained look at the numbers suggests that 1 \) the overall white mortality rate has restabilized , rather than continuing to rise , since the mid2000s , that 2 \) the mortality increase was actually more notable for thirtysomethings and early fortysomethings than for the 4554 cohort , and that 3 \) it s white women whose mortality rates have kept on increasing over the last decade , even as white men have seen their mortality rates fall a little once again gelman notes that none of these complications change the basic casedeaton finding , or make it any less troubling overall relative to both europeans and to black and hispanic americans , \( working class \) white america clearly has had a grim , deathhaunted early twentyfirst century but they do challenge one of the easiest narratives about what exactly is happening in white america namely , that it s all about a whitemale struggle to adjust to a postindustrial , postsexual revolution landscape , a struggle that drives some men to drink and drugs and suicide as old age starts to loom a quick read of the original paper summoned up the image of a divorced fiftyyearold blue collar guy on disability payments as the face of the mortality crisis , and if gelman has it right then that may not be the right way to think about what s been happening or at least it may not be the most precise way to think about it the destinies of men and women tend to be intertwined , and i wouldn t be too quick to assume that the welldocumented post1970s struggles of working class men , social and economic , can t help explain why working class women are now dying in larger numbers indeed , you can retrofit both the conservative and liberal narratives about the working class crisis to gelman s amended data by just extending the causal arrow a little further whether it s our economic system or our familialsexual order that s broken down , the struggles of men inevitably place far more burdens on women as mothers , breadwinners and selfprotectors while depriving them of one of the most reliable forms of human companionship and support and to the extent that this is , in part , a crisis of disappointed hopes as well , in human terms it isn t particularly surprising that the improved wageearning prospects for women since the 1970s wouldn t compensate for the loss of stability in family arrangements , the failure of men to play what so long as one sex bears children and the other doesn t can reasonably be described as their appropriate part but the central mystery of these numbers , the fact that blacks and hispanics aren t experiencing any kind of mortality spike , remains mysterious if the mortality increase itself is more a female problem than a male one after all , both africanamerican women and hispanic women are clearly burdened by the absence of fathers and the dearth of marriageable men than are white women the spread of single parenthood through the white working class hasn t yet outpaced its ongoing spread among blacks and \( especially , of late \) hispanics and the basic economic picture for racial minorities has hardly gotten rosier since 2000 or 2009 the housing bust , in particular , hit both hispanic and black families particularly hard , but it was only white women whose mortality numbers went up during the great recession why \? my column s attempt at an answer borrowed from this fewyearsold andrew cherlin brad wilcox paper , which suggested that in certain ways minority communities may be better adapted to a world of social fragmentation and economic stagnation than are working class white communities this is a very tentative idea , but you can see how it would fit a story about women s struggles , in particular in different ways and for varying historical reasons , africanamerican and hispanicimmigrant culture rely more on extendedkinship networks and retain a stronger mutualsupport ethic in their churches than much of anglo culture , and for women raising kids without a consistent paternal presence \( or single women looking for intimacy and fulfilling social roles \) these kind of cultural matrices have more to offer than just a shattered expectation of nuclearfamily normalcy it s still best to have stable twoparent families , in other words , but if you re going to live with and through social fragmentation , minority communities have both inheritances and adaptations that some white communities lack this possibility , in turn , has complicated implications for our usual politicalcultural debates so complicated that i m not even quite sure what they are ! but here s a for instance many white cultural conservatives have a habit of regarding the post1960s story of black family life purely as a cautionary tale , in an if we aren t careful all of america will go the way of black america ! sense but if the black twoparent family has crumbled , black communitarianism has not , and africanamerican christianity in particular is showing a little more resilience in the current era of the rising nones than are many white churches i ve written before that reconciliation across racial lines , or the lack thereof , will play a big role in shaping the future of a weakened american christianity , and it may be that we can say the same about the weakened american family any future stabilization , any return to twoparent norms , will have to be built on some of the pre post bourgeois foundations where people find stability at the moment , and those foundations are sometimes more in evidence in communities that are culturally alien to white conservatives , and that they we should strive to better appreciate and understand i can come up with various ways these findings should challenge liberals as well , having to do with religion and working class fertility trends among other points but i probably spend enough time trying to challenge liberals on these issues , so for now i ll just end these speculations here
washington over the last few months , harold m ickes , a longtime ally of , has helped organize private meetings around the country with union leaders , clinton backers and democratic strategists the pressing topic who will step up to be the democrats' megadonors in the 2016 presidential race \? republican contenders have already secured hundreds of millions of dollars in commitments from a stable of billionaires , including a wall street hedge fund executive , a las vegas casino magnate , a florida auto dealer , a wyoming investor and , of course , the kansasborn billionaires david h and charles g koch but none of the biggest democratic donors from past elections for example , the chicago investor fred eychaner , the climatechange activist tom steyer and the entertainment mogul jeffrey katzenberg have committed to supporting mrs clinton on nearly the same scale no one has stepped forward as the savior , said matt bennett , a longtime democratic consultant in washington the leading backing mrs clinton , priorities usa action , has won commitments of only about 15 million so far , democrats involved with the group s fundraising said and while the absence of a competitive race for the democratic nomination gives mrs clinton more time to catch up with republican rivals , her allies are planning to push the party s wealthiest donors for more money than most of them have ever given in planning sessions and oneonone meetings with donors , mr ickes , who is a priorities usa board member , and other clinton supporters are discussing how to raise as much as 300 million for democratic outside groups that is almost twice as much as democratic super pacs and other outside groups spent to help reelect president obama in 2012 , when conservative super pacs far outspent liberal ones this ambitious goal will require the emergence of a new class of at least 20 democratic donors who can give 5 million or even 10 million each mr ickes said recruiting them would not be easy our side is n't used to being asked for that kind of money , mr ickes said if you asked them to put up 100 million for a hospital wing , they 'd be the first in line the hurdles begin with the candidate while mrs clinton has committed to meeting personally with potential super pac donors , people close to her say she has not yet grappled with the kind of bigdonor courting that has framed the early months of the republican race she is also navigating the intricate rules on what a candidate may do to help super pacs , which , since the supreme court s citizens united decision in 2010 , can raise unlimited funds from individuals and corporations but may not coordinate with candidates fearful of violating the rules , mrs clinton plans to limit her direct appeals to donors those appeals also threaten to undercut her message on the corrupting influence of unchecked money in politics she has called for repealing citizens united and has that changing the country s campaign finance system to get unaccountable money out of it once and for all would be among her top priorities as president mrs clinton also faces a perception that neither she nor her husband , former president bill clinton , is exactly lacking cash together , they earned at least 30 million in the last 16 months and mr clinton s aggressive courting of donors , in the white house and now as head of the clinton foundation , has been an enduring source of controversy inflated estimates of mrs clinton s campaign budget a figure of 25 billion was widely circulated have also been a headache for her campaign and for priorities usa a more realistic fundraising target for her campaign , they say , is around 1 billion one challenge for mr ickes and other fundraisers is convincing potential donors , large and small , of the importance of super pacs to mrs clinton s chances in part to convey that message , priorities usa recently brought in guy cecil , a wellknown democratic operative with close ties to mrs clinton s campaign , to lead the organization in an interview , mr cecil acknowledged the need for a cultural shift among democratic givers people are starting to understand that priorities' work is critical and not just a luxury , he said if we are going to be successful in 2016 , it will require more from everyone , at every level mrs clinton will have little difficulty mustering a large network of socalled bundlers , the donors at the heart of a presidential campaign s fundraising operation , who solicit contributions limited to a few thousand dollars from their friends and business associates but the pool of democratic super pac donors is smaller and more specialized the checks they write are far larger , and the money would go not to mrs clinton s campaign but to outside groups like priorities usa some of those donors have poured substantial sums into democratic super pacs in past election cycles mr steyer , a retired california hedge fund founder , in 2014 to pressure candidates to back policies to combat climate change , becoming the democratic party s leading donor mr eychaner , a pressshy chicago media investor active in gay rights issues , gave at least 22 million to democratic super pacs in 2012 and 2014 other potential super pac donors , like the walmart heiress alice walton , the los angeles investor ron burkle and the media investor haim saban , are believed to be prospects this year because of their longstanding ties to the clinton family another possibility , and one of the wealthiest , is former mayor michael r bloomberg of new york , though most of the millions of dollars he has donated in recent years have gone to , which has backed republicans as well as democrats other potential donors of 10 million or more , fearful of being targeted for attacks by republicans , want to write the biggest checks only when their peers do , forcing democratic fundraisers to devise what are in effect donor buddy systems , matching up wouldbe givers who can synchronize their checkwriting for those still nervous , priorities usa is also considering resurrecting an affiliated nonprofit group that could accept secret donations such fundraising has been roundly denounced by watchdog groups and , recently , by mrs clinton herself a bigger problem , democratic fundraisers and super pac officials acknowledge , is that they are out of practice the peak for donations to democratic outside groups was 2004 , when the hedge fund billionaire george soros and the insurance executive poured close to 40 million into groups opposing president george w bush the groups collected almost 200 million , largely on the strength of liberal donors' dislike of mr bush there will definitely be some sticker shock , said michael vachon , a political adviser to mr soros the money game has changed even since the last election ted cruz s super pac raised 30 million in a few weeks , mr vachon added , and he has no more chance of being president than i have he said mr soros had not yet decided how much he would give during the 2016 cycle mel heifetz , a philadelphia real estate investor who gave 1 million in 2012 to priorities usa , plans to contribute roughly the same amount for this campaign but he worries about how much his fellow donors will give even the wealthy democrats i know have limitations as to what they 'll contribute , he said in each of the last two election cycles , 14 of the top 20 donors gave their money to conservative organizations and republican campaigns , according to data from the center for responsive politics that does not include most donations to the conservative network overseen by the kochs , composed largely of nonprofit groups that do not reveal their donors the network is planning to raise 889 million for its political and philanthropic efforts through 2016 sheldon adelson , the las vegas casino developer who spent 93 million in 2012 to support republican candidates , is likely to invest a similar sum this time robert mercer , a hedge fund executive , bankroll super pacs supporting mr cruz , a united states senator from texas norman braman , a billionaire miami auto dealer , to spend 10 million or more to support the campaign of senator marco rubio of florida and foster friess , a mutualfund investor in wyoming who spent more than 2 million on rick santorum s bid for the white house , is supporting him again this time democrats concede that they may simply be outgunned in the battle for wealthy donors it s really david versus goliath , said chris lehane , a democratic strategist and adviser to mr steyer they hosted a fundraiser for mrs clinton at mr steyer s san francisco home this month , with donations capped at 2 , 700 mr steyer has not said how much he plans to spend in the 2016 elections , but mr lehane said his contributions would be a drop in the bucket compared to what the koch brothers and big oil are spending to push their agenda
washington four months after a historic to limit its atomic ambitions , american officials and private security groups say they see a surge in sophisticated computer espionage by , culminating in a series of cyberattacks against state department officials over the past month the surge has led american officials to a stark conclusion for , cyberespionage with the power it gives the iranians to jab at the united states and its neighbors without provoking a military response is becoming a tool to seek the kind of influence that some hardliners in iran may have hoped its would eventually provide while american officials doubt cyber skills , or even the most advanced cyber weapons , will ever have that kind of power , iran s cyber focus these days is notable over the past month , iranian hackers identified individual state department officials who focus on iran and the middle east , and broke into their email and social media accounts , according to diplomatic and law enforcement officials familiar with the investigation the state department became aware of the compromises only after facebook told the victims that statesponsored hackers had compromised their accounts it was very carefully designed and showed the degree to which they understood which of our staff was working on iran issues now that the nuclear deal is done , said one senior american official who oversees much of that operation and who requested anonymity to discuss a continuing investigation it was subtle iran s cyberskills are not yet equal to those of russia or china but the attack against the state department by using the social media accounts of young government employees to gain access to their friends across the administration a focus that had not been seen before showed an ingenuity beyond the russian bruteforce attack that infiltrated the state department s unclassified email system a year ago in the aftermath of the nuclear accord , american intelligence officials have warned senior officials that they expect iran to ramp up its use of cyberespionage the director of national intelligence , james r clapper jr , has told congress in closed sessions that he believes statesponsored iranian hackers are not attempting big attacks that could threaten their ability to reap the financial rewards of complying with the nuclear accord , according to two officials familiar with those briefings but he said they were stepping up traditional cyberespionage , and getting better at it the iranians have not been as destructive as they could be , but they are getting far more aggressive in cyberespionage , which they know is less likely to prompt a response from the united states , said james lewis , who runs the cyberprogram at the center for strategic and international studies in washington they seem very attuned to every stage of implementing the nuclear agreement congress is responding in the lawmakers passed this month , united states cyber command , which runs the military s offensive and defensive internet activities , is instructed next year the games are intended to replicate the threats from china , iran , north korea and russia iranian cyberattacks are hardly new they arose after the american at natanz , an that destroyed upward of a thousand iranian centrifuges and drove home to the iranian leadership the destructive power of computer weapons the american attacks began toward the end of the george w bush administration since then , american government officials and private security researchers say iranian hackers have been behind a series of powerful attacks against american banks that took their websites offline , as well as a , the world s largest producer , that replaced data on employee machines with an image of a burning american flag american government officials also blame iran for a similarly destructive attack at rasgas , the qatari natural gas giant , and for an in las vegas , where a large number of computers were destroyed \( the casino , while a seemingly odd target , is controlled by sheldon adelson , a major funder of republican candidates , and the attack followed his suggestion that the united states detonate a nuclear weapon in the iranian desert to force the country to give up its nuclear technology \) but last year , private security researchers say , iranians began using cyberattacks for espionage , rather than for destruction and disruption beginning in may 2014 , researchers found evidence that iranian hackers were targeting iranian dissidents , and later policy makers , senior military personnel and defense contractors in the united states , england and israel , according to a report by isight partners , a computer intelligence firm in dallas for the most part , researchers said , the attacks were basic spear phishing attempts , in which attackers tried to lure their victims into clicking on a malicious link , in this case by impersonating members of the news media iranian hackers were successful in more than a quarter of their attempts the number of such attacks reached a climax in may just ahead of the nuclear talks in vienna in july reaching more than 1 , 500 attempts , according to researchers at check point , the israeli cybersecurity company some researchers witnessed an even more troubling trend in the months leading up to the talks , iran s hackers began probing critical infrastructure networks in what appeared to be reconnaissance for cyberattacks meant to cause physical damage , said john hultquist , the director of cyberespionage analysis at isight partners and then something curious happened in june and july , as american and iranian negotiators gathered in vienna to cut a deal on iran s nuclear program , attacks against targets in the united states stopped not a single phishing attempt was logged by check point and the critical infrastructure probes went silent as well , according to isight partners , and have not resumed instead , isight s researchers saw iran s hackers switch focus they began targeting victims in israel as well as members of the islamic state in july as the militant group began expanding its territory across iraq and then , in august , just two weeks after the nuclear accord was reached , the trickle of cyberattacks against the group s usual targets resumed check point s researchers were able to hack the attackers' target list , which included 1 , 600 individuals , from scholars , scientists , chief executives and ministry officials to education institutes , journalists and human rights activists across the globe the victims may have never learned of the compromises were it not for a decision by facebook last month to use a new alert system to notify users when facebook s security team believed statesponsored hackers had hijacked their accounts just weeks into the new alert system , state department officials began to see a troubling new message pop up on their facebook accounts we believe your facebook account and your other online accounts may be the target of attacks by statesponsored actors , the message read some details of the espionage on state department employees were by the wall street journal state department officials say none of this will affect the coming in the nuclear deal the international atomic energy agency reported last week that iran is already beginning to dismantle some of its centrifuges at the same site the united states and israel attacked with cyberweapons
i 'll do my best to run from the word retired and anything that looks like i 've settled for scoring in the 80s at the golf club and boring people to distraction with war stories in the pub happily , i 'll be continuing to write for the times on a freelance basis , and that should keep me up to par , since none of the editors will cut me much slack solely because i 've worn a groove at the paper over the years my brief from the editors is to hunt down space in the paper and on the web on any story they may see fit to print so if i vanish into the journalistic ether if i just fade away , as described as the fitting end for old campaigners it 'll be my fault , not the editors' that s a hard choice , but i 'd have to save a place on the short list for the first big story i landed on page 1 , a bannerheadline account of a in the winter of 1975 that may have saved me from failing my probation at the times after a nervous and uncertain start my boss at the time , arthur gelb , the fabled metro editor who has a guaranteed place in the paper s pantheon , was generous enough to overlook the fact that the story published under my byline was crafted from the panicked scraps i phoned in from the airport concourse that night by , the crack reporter who turned the elegant rewrite into a high art , saving many a career beyond mine without that piece , there might never have been the chance to write at close quarters about , about or about the manifold as they consolidated their totalitarian grip on power in afghanistan , among the stories that propelled me back onto page 1 in the years that followed i 've always felt that passion is a legitimate an indispensable tool for a reporter in the face of the malevolent outrages of war but that can never be allowed to overwhelm what matters critically to a newspaper like the times , with the trust it has with its readers to render balanced accounts that hold true to the facts , or as many of them as are accessible amid the tide of confusion and deceit that are the inescapable companions of violent conflict that is the gold standard , the compulsion to which passion must always yield , and it s one that times editors work vigilantly to uphold sometimes , to an extent that almost all war reporters have experienced at one time or another , recasting stories in ways that cottonwrap all passion but , bottom line , i have held stubbornly to the belief that the reporter s duty is not to be neutral in the face of outrage so much as to be fair , the more so when neutrality has the damnable effect of making unequal things appear equal identify the villains , and depict them as the satanic killers they often are \? yes , but never at the cost of obscuring the perpetrators' accounts in justification , however mendacious , of what they have done for all that , it would be vain to deny that editors have their own bounden trust to save reporters not infrequently so , in my case from the excesses of their passion with the cruel but necessary judgment of the blue pencil you ask if there has ever come a moment to take matters into my own hands \? there have been great reporters who have would never have claimed to have been neutral in the spanish civil war , nor even always fair but ours has not been an age that favors his kind of swashbuckling commitment in our time , it has become common for young reporters to give as their moral code , indeed as their reason for choosing the profession , that they aim to create a better world it is a handsome thing , but one that can foster a missionary complex a hubris , even that can favor a blindness to inconvenient facts to the advantage of others an important component of any career spent in hard places is the ability to weigh risk intelligently against reward , and i 've always thought that any bill of attainder drawn up in my case would have to include the occasions when i got that calculus disastrously wrong a sense of adventure , a readiness to push the boundaries and a willingness to accept a degree of personal hazard all are part of achieving success in the world of the foreign correspondent , as in many other fields but those qualities can quickly carry over into the foolhardy and the headstrong , not to mention a risk to life itself was not hard to justify for the chance it offered to discover what was happening in remote parts of the country as the leaden socialist dictates of mao zedong yielded to the unleashed pursuit of wealth among the rural poor but it was never a good bet that mao s loyalists in the state security apparatus would accept the flagrant flouting of their authority , and my subsequent imprisonment for spying , for all the years of dinner table yarns that it yielded , proved embarrassing to the paper and disruptive to a times foothold in china that had taken many years to establish there were other times when the ambition to reach outposts that had remained beyond the reach of others yielded a more personal sense of reproach , a sort of sickness of the soul that i could have been so cavalier in gambling on the welfare of my wife , jane , and our three children when the children were all still quite young , i pressed the sovietinstalled afghan president , najibullah , to let me fly on an aging sovietbuilt antonov troopcarrying plane to an embattled enclave in the southeast of the country , around the , that had become a totem for the ability of moscow s legacy in the country to survive the onslaught of the mujahedeen after soviet troops had withdrawn the soviet ambassador called me in to talk to his military aide , a muchberibboned general , and they cautioned against the flight as far too risky but i went anyway , and sitting there during the midnight flight , amid leaking barrels of gasoline and ruptured boxes of ammunition , with weeping afghan soldiers prostrate in muslim prayer and the marijuanafueled pilots in the blackedout cockpit banking sharply on the spiraling descent to miss a stinger missile fired at the aircraft by insurgents on the heights above the town , i said a rapid prayer for myself , that providence would forgive me for my crass irresponsibility when i 'd made it safely back to kabul , i realized the full idiocy of what i 'd done in the fact that the resulting story had never been a strong candidate for page 1 , in any case , the more so for the fact that i could hardly admit to the extreme dangers involved without my editors concluding that i had gone completely round the twist i belong to a generation of reporters who grew up in the wake of world war ii , in the time of the cold war , and our attitudes were formed by the manichaean struggle between the nations of the west , with their culture of freedom and democracy , and the grim totalitarianism of the soviet union and the countries of the soviet bloc my own view was inevitably influenced by the fact that my father was a wartime fighter pilot who became a nato commander in west germany in the 1950s , and by my times assignment in the early 1980s to moscow , which was then still trapped in the miseries of pregorbachev repression the essentials of that , for me , have never changed the united states , in partnership with britain , my own country , and with other nations of the western alliance , remains indispensable to such stability that there is in the world it is enough to ask what kind of a world it would be if the united states were to be supplanted as the predominant power among nations by virtually any measure , political , economic , military or cultural by the states with ambition to displace the united states by midcentury , principally china and russia having experienced life in both countries at first hand , and over a number of years , i 'd have to say that it s not the kind of world i 'd much relish living in for all that , the experience of the last decade , especially , has eroded some of my confidence a commonenough conclusion , i would guess that the west has the answers to the poverty and strife in the distant world , or even in quarters closer to home the occupation of iraq , and its disastrous consequence in the current conflict in iraq and syria , as well as the debacle that has become of the arab spring , so recently hailed as the harbinger of a new era of democracy and liberty across the arab world , has demonstrated how powerful the forces of faith , tribe and sect the old gods remain , and how unyielding to the vision of a civic society that the united states and its allies promoted in iraq , at a cost of tens of thousands of lives and billions of wasted dollars there is a long list of candidates many who got away but i 'd settle for , who was in the last , turbulent years of his life when i started as a foreign correspondent in what we then called peking in 1971 it was an assignment that opened the way for me to a job at the times , which had a syndication agreement for what i was writing with my then employer , the globe and mail of toronto , the only western newspaper with a resident correspondent in china until the times and other american papers opened their own bureaus later in the '70s those first years in china coincided with the latter period of the cultural revolution , the 10 years of disastrous upheaval launched by mao in 1966 to restore his personal power against a politburo group that , in mao s words , had taken to treating him like a dead uncle at a funeral millions died , but mao , for the most part , was nowhere to be seen , save on the huge big character billboards displaying his image and his revolutionary exhortations on every building and every street corner one chinese official questioned as to mao s whereabouts said delphically at the time , the chinese people s great leader chairman mao zedong is everywhere in general , but nowhere in particular just so the closest i ever got to him was when i briefly very briefly led the peking marathon in 1973 within the first mile , the race skirted the outer wall of the communist leaders' zhongnanhai residential compound site of mao s encounter with richard nixon the previous year between the massed crowds that were a feature of the time then , and later , when i was feted as a hero atop the tiananmen gate to the forbidden city for being the only foreigner to compete notwithstanding a finish that placed me somewhere around 1 , 120th , an hour or more behind the winners i understood then , for just a moment , what a heady thing it was to be feted by a million or more people waving their little red books and their sea of red flags but no sighting of mao , for all the tumult and what would i have asked him if i had met him \? it s a question that has coursed through innumerable dreams in the years since , along with a nightmare element that always recurs after getting through those zhongnanhai gates , and ushered into his presence , i 've found in my dreams that i 'd forgotten in the fluster to bring my notebook and pen mao , insistently avuncular , put it right in a jiffy , pulling a goldnibbed parker fountain pen from the pocket of his highcollared mao jacket and handing me what else \? a notebook bound in red leather psychologists , go figure how remote it all seems now , the optimism that swept the west after the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 with the specter of nuclear holocaust lifted , we hoped that our children would grow up into a world that for them , and their children , would be less fraught than ours , and that of our fathers and grandfathers who fought on the somme and the rhine and how wrong that has proved to be the end of the military confrontation with moscow has proved to be a distorting prism , with russia turning so swiftly back toward its old habits of authoritarian repression , imperial ambition and hostility to the west who could have foreseen the terrifying scourge of the islamic state fanatics , 13 years after the sept 11 attacks sent the united states to war in afghanistan to uproot the malevolence of the taliban and al qaeda \? and who can explain that a world with a battalion of billionaires and the ability to land robotic explorers on distant comets has two billion people , nearly a third of mankind , still trapped in grinding poverty \? who can say if the blooddimmed tide of ethnic , sectarian and regional strife will ebb , and when \? will the measures we take to protect ourselves from the violent discontents of the world end by eroding the freedoms won by the generations who built the west \? none of this can be safely foretold but if the experience of wide areas of the world over the past 40 and more years has taught me anything , it is that even a halting reconciliation of the conflicts that wound the world will rest , in this century as in the last , on a powerful , outwardlooking america still primed to shoulder the burden of leadership in the world sorry , but i 'd like to offer three commonplace ideals 1 to see to it that the western world s huge food surpluses are effectively distributed to ensure that no child nobody , for that matter should ever go to bed hungry 2 to use more of our wealth in the western world to support basic medical care in the poorest parts of the globe , and to do so as part of restructured aid programs that eliminate the theft of so much aid money by corrupt politicians 3 to round up all of the world s armory of kalashnikov rifles all automatic weapons , for that matter , that are not under tight control by governments that observe civilized standards and destroy them in a giant scrapyard crusher in the face of how disastrously it has all turned out , it s a question that many of us with footprints on the american role in that war should feel compelled to answer it s never going to be enough to say , as i can , that i was never a proponent of the american and british invasion , and that i saw my responsibility , ahead of the invasion , to chronicle , from baghdad , the grotesque excesses of saddam s enforcers against his own people , the scale and murderousness of which have had few parallels in the modern world outside of khmer rouge cambodia and the north korea of the psychopathic family kim if that helped pave george w bush s way to war , there was not much in what i wrote that could have been written in any other way the outrageous brutality was iraqi society s most obtrusive characteristic , chronicled for years by the world s most respected human rights groups saddam s rule , over 24 years , had become a murder incorporated , to an extent that sickened even those of us who had spent long years in some of the world s other nastiest places like so many others , i was never convinced by the principal justification advanced for the invasion , that saddam was hiding a stockpile of forbidden , because the evidence was fragmentary and inconclusive but i did feel , as did most of my baghdadbased american and british colleagues , that action to end saddam s tyrannicide , for the sake of his own people , would have at least a sound moral foundation what we failed to do , and it was crucial , was to step back from the daytoday pressures before war to look at the that would emerge when the carapace of saddam s terror was lifted it would not have been easy , given the relentless efforts of our government minders to keep us from talking to all iraqis who were not stool pigeons for saddam , but a closer reading of the country s long history of sectarian and tribal schism combined with a keener ear for the warnings of many of the west s finest middle east scholars might have schooled us to warn how improbable a venture the west had embraced in seeking to bring a westernstyle democracy to iraq
raida , yemen about all that remain of s ancient and once vibrant jewish community are untended cemeteries , dramatic hillside ghetto villages of thousandyearold stone houses and a few people like abraham jacob and his extended family most of them live near this northern yemeni town in amran province , deep in territory controlled by houthi militants , whose leaders have made antisemitism a central plank in their political platform it shows when mr jacob , 36 , came to the souk here thursday to meet journalists and take them on a rare visit to his community , he rode a battered motorcycle , his long , curly earlocks flapping and making him readily identifiable as jewish when traffic stalled for a minute , a khat dealer accosted the visitors' yemeni interpreter , shuaib almosawa , a journalist what are you doing with that dirty jew \? the dealer said why are you friendly with him \? he s a human being , after all , mr almosawa replied no , he s not , the dealer said god has damned him the last of s once numerous jews , who predated muslims by many centuries , have seldom been so threatened and had so few protectors the houthis , who now dominate the country , are particularly strong in the two places with confirmed remaining yemeni jews here in raida , where there are 55 jews , and in sana , the capital , where a small number live under what amounts to house arrest by the houthi leadership the two countries that have long facilitated jewish emigration from yemen the united states and britain both last week , as did most other western countries and the yemeni strongman who for three decades was the jews' protector , former president ali abdullah saleh , is not only out of power , but also , more recently , out of favor with the houthis we have no friends , mr jacob said , so we just try to stay away from everyone as much as we can they have more to fear than bad words the encounter in the souk took place a short distance from where a yemeni air force pilot in 2008 accosted the brother of a prominent rabbi and the father of eight children , as he stepped out of his home the assailant coldly said , jew , here s a message from islam , and then fatally shot mr nahari , who was unarmed , five times with an assault rifle , according to yemeni news accounts the pilot was convicted and sentenced to death for murder , but mr nahari s family , pressured into accepting blood money from the killer s tribe to spare his life , as soon as possible in the next few years , nearly all of raida s jews followed among the exceptions were abraham jacob and eight other interrelated households , 55 people in all , most of them children , according to suleiman jacob , 45 , abraham s eldest brother and the community s unofficial rabbi and kosher butcher like the men , most of the boys in the jacob family wear earlocks , a proud sign of who they are in an otherwise muslim society now suleiman keeps his earlocks thin and long enough so that when he goes out he can tuck them out of sight under an arabicstyle head scarf , which also covers the skullcaps \( or kipas \) that the men and boys all wear it s a shame that we have to do that sometimes , but we do , he said abraham says he refuses to hide his earlocks i fear none but god yemeni jews , like those in other arab countries , have suffered wave after wave of persecution originally many of them lived in saada province in the north , which was predominantly zaydi , members of an offshoot of shiite islam that historically were antisemitic the houthis , whose base is in saada , embedded that attitude in their slogan , death to america , death to israel , damnation to the jews the houthis fought a succession of wars with the central government beginning in 2004 , and in 2007 , a houthi representative in saada gave jews there an ultimatum leave in 10 days or face attack yemen s president then , mr saleh , though a zaydi himself , became a champion of the jews from saada at government expense , mr saleh relocated them to a gated community in sana next to the american embassy that place is known as tourist city , and as recently as 2009 , there were 400 jews there under the former president s protection now there are said to be only 20 to 40 many of them have reportedly cut off their earlocks after one of their number was killed in 2002 just outside tourist city s gates by a muslim who accused the victim of ruining his life through witchcraft one of the jews still there , yahya yousef , who described himself as the sana rabbi , expressed eagerness to be interviewed when contacted by telephone but said he could not do so unless the houthidominated security office in the interior ministry gave formal permission repeated requests over a week for such permission were unsuccessful army guards at the community s gate refused entry to journalists in raida , abraham jacob shrugged off his neighbors' antisemitism , saying , there are good people , and there are bad people but it is harder to overlook the houthis' slogan , which is chanted at all houthi rallies , broadcast on television and painted on what seems like every blank wall space in areas they control we know there are houthi people who are understanding and tolerant , and we have not been harmed by any of them , mr jacob said but this cursing us to damnation is distressing and hurtful to us honestly , his brother suleiman said , we are a little afraid of the houthi takeover and do n't know what to do about it their family s choice would be to emigrate to the united states , rather than israel , suleiman said , because america is quieter , and we 've had enough problems already despite the embassy closings , he said he remained hopeful that his son jacob , who will turn 13 late this year , can celebrate his bar mitzvah outside yemen the boy has already been memorizing the hebrew verses that he will have to chant for the occasion he is my best hebrew student , suleiman said the neighborhood still has young children and their parents , as well as elderly people , but there are few single adults of marriageable age most have emigrated the last wedding took place two years ago , abraham said the newlyweds left yemen and never came back there is n't a single one of us here who does n't want to leave , suleiman said soon there will be no jews in yemen , inshallah , he said , using the arabic expression for god willing
moscow for , victory came three days after victory day , in the form of secretary of state s visit this week to the black sea resort city of sochi it was widely interpreted here as a signal of surrender by the americans an olive branch from president obama , and an acknowledgment that and its leader are simply too important to ignore since the more than a year ago , mr obama has worked aggressively to isolate russia and its renegade president , , portraying him as a lawless bully atop an economically failing , increasingly irrelevant petrostate mr obama led the charge by the west to punish mr putin for his intervention in , economic powers , imposing harsh sanctions on some of mr putin s closest confidants and delivering financial and military assistance to the new ukrainian government in recent months , however , russia has not only weathered those attacks and levied painful countersanctions on america s european allies , but has also proved stubbornly important on the world stage that has been true especially in regard to syria , where its proposal to confiscate chemical weapons has kept president bashar alassad , a kremlin ally , in power , and in the negotiations that secured a tentative deal on iran s  mr putin , who over 15 years as russia s paramount leader has consistently confounded his adversaries , be they foreign or domestic , once again seems to be emerging on top if not as an outright winner in his most recent confrontation with the west , then certainly as a national hero , unbowed , firmly in control , and having surrendered nothing , especially not crimea , his most coveted prize putin is looking pretty smart right now , said matthew rojansky , director of the kennan institute , a washington research group focused on russia and the former soviet union mr rojansky cautioned that mr putin s seemingly strengthened position could prove illusory the and remains dangerously reliant on energy sources , and most analysts say the longterm outlook for oil and gas prices is bleak although mr putin may look smart at the moment , mr rojansky said , none of this was necessarily by design , adding , it does n't necessarily teach us anything fundamentally about him or how his system works nevertheless , with oil prices seeming at least to have stabilized after a modest recovery , and the ruble rebounding so strongly from a late autumn collapse that the russian central bank has begun buying dollars to keep it from appreciating further , the western economic sanctions seem to have fallen short meanwhile , a ceasefire is mostly holding in eastern , limiting casualties and vastly increasing pressure on president petro o poroshenko of ukraine , who so far has been unable to deliver the increased autonomy for the prorussian regions of donetsk and luhansk that was called for in the truce agreement brokered by france and germany the subtle shift by the obama administration reflects a pragmatic recognition that the policy of isolating russia , economically and diplomatically , is failing , analysts say americans realized that sanctions against russia did not quite work , viktor a kremenyuk , deputy director of the institute of the usa and canada , a research organization that is part of the russian academy of sciences , said in an interview with svobodnaya pressa , a news site here they thought russia had become so much a part of the world market and depended on it so much that it would be enough to frighten moscow a little to make it surrender , mr kremenyuk said in reality , it s all different russia not only withstood sanctions but even introduced countersanctions and demonstrated that it is not going to turn off this road he added the us cannot simply capitulate this is why the policy change begins with statements like , we shall think , ' we shall assess the situation' in fact , this is a cautious departure from the policy of sanctions to be sure , the united states position on ukraine has not shifted , and mr kerry said at a news conference in sochi that he had made clear our deep concerns including about russia s continued arming , training , command and control of separatist forces the administration portrayed the visit as , and mr kerry in his remarks again insisted that russia and ukraine fulfill the terms of the ceasefire accord signed in minsk , belarus for the russian news media and political pundits , however , it was striking that mr kerry s arrival came three days after moscow s huge celebration of the 70th anniversary of the allied victory over nazi germany an event that the united states refused to attend and had urged other nations to shun as well that snub was regarded by ordinary russians , even those with little interest in global affairs , as disrespectful of soviet war veterans and the millions killed in action mr kerry laid a wreath at a memorial in sochi , in a gesture interpreted as an attempt to make some amends for skipping the moscow events while the kremlin has hardly been gloating in recent days , it has noted firmly that the subject of crimea was not discussed at the meeting , and some russians officials have expressed a sense of victory some officials in ukraine and in europe said they believed the obama administration s outreach to russia reflected a rising concern in washington that the european union would not be willing to renew the economic sanctions against russia when they expire in july european nations have far more trade and other economic dealings with russia than the united states does and so they have borne the brunt of the countersanctions barring imports of european goods , including most agricultural products some countries like greece have publicly voiced disagreement with the sanctions policy in recent weeks mr kremenyuk and other analysts , however , said they believed the major motivation of the united states was to seek russia s assistance on other more pressing problems there are some issues in which americans cannot make progress without russia , mr kremenyuk told svobodnaya pressa for instance , iran and the iranian or syria , where nothing can be done without us of course , they will not yell help us ! ' no way but within the last couple of years americans found some areas in the middle east where they cannot do much , but russia can alexander g baunov , a senior associate at the carnegie moscow center , a research group , said that based on a recent visit to washington he believed that middle east issues were more important to the americans than ukraine it s clear that obama is thinking about his legacy , his place in history , mr baunov said in an interview not to achieve the final deal with iran will be a big defeat for him , so he needs russia for this mr baunov said that ultimately ukraine mattered more to russia russia is ready to sacrifice more for ukraine than the west and the united states , he said it is willing to sacrifice more economically and in lives than the west obama realizes americans wo n't do the same mr baunov said that the kremlin was probably relieved at the easing of tensions beyond all this antiwestern rhetoric , the russian leadership and putin himself are not very comfortable being isolated , he said , noting that the crisis in ukraine was rooted partly in over russia s interests and values not being respected in the west the main motivation of russia s behavior is that they are not treated as equal , he said for mr putin , however , success is measured in simple terms , mr rojansky said ukraine is a really a regime survival story for putin at home , he added he is still alive he is still in control he is still in power he has survived
tampa , fla the , young upstarts playing against the , a team in the midst of building a dynasty , wanted to dispel any notion that they were due for a letdown after their somewhat surprising run to the stanley cup finals from the outset of game 1 on wednesday , the lightning relied on speed and creativity to overwhelm the blackhawks , who are vying for their third title in the last six seasons the lightning s wings were a step ahead to the puck , and their defensemen kept chicago s stars bottled up on offense but the blackhawks fended off a relentless tampa bay attack , mostly thanks to their goaltender , corey crawford , who made several spectacular saves in front of his net after giving up a goal on a nifty backhand shot by alex killorn at 4 minutes 31 seconds of the first period , the blackhawks stymied the lightning the rest of the way and rallied for a 21 victory at amalie arena they were flying at the start , said crawford , who made 22 saves our guys stayed calm just not lose it out there , keep it going , keep playing our game the lightning have found success this postseason with quick scoring chances , even in games that were tight defensive struggles a nifty pass here , a long strike there , and just like that a goal that was what happened on the goal by killorn , who took a pass from defenseman anton stralman and , with his back to the chicago net , knocked it out of the air with a backhand swipe the puck bounced into the net between crawford s left ankle and the goal post the lightning seemed poised to run away with the game the captain steven stamkos , ondrej palat and cedric paquette peppered crawford with shots , but none reached the net given the onslaught , the blackhawks were lucky to be trailing by just one goal blackhawks defenseman duncan keith said he was not surprised by the lightning s fast start it s a new series , he said they came out firing , and they got the first goal it was close , and they got the crowd behind them we 've played in a lot of hectic buildings in the playoffs , and i thought we did a pretty good job of dealing with that as the game went on in the third period , the lightning had a chance to pad their lead when center ryan callahan broke free for an open chance on crawford but callahan failed to get the puck into the net then the blackhawks finally struck the way the lightning had done so often this postseason with less than seven minutes remaining in the third period , wing teuvo teravainen took a pass at the top of the left circle and lifted the puck about 50 feet toward the net lightning goalie ben bishop \( 19 saves \) was screened by several players and never seemed to see the shot rifle over his shoulder at 13 28 keith and andrew shaw were credited with assists the arena , until then uniformly behind the lightning , erupted as pockets of blackhawks fans in red jerseys stood , cheered and exhaled the goal propelled the blackhawks less than two minutes later , the lightning turned the puck over in their zone , and center antoine vermette fired a wrist shot past bishop , who was again screened by several players , at 15 26 vermette , who had also scored the winning goal in the second overtime in game 4 against the anaheim ducks in the western conference finals , saw it differently on that play , it was just working hard , create a turnover , and we got the puck where we wanted it , vermette said after dominating more than threequarters of the game , the lightning had lost their composure with less than five minutes remaining , tampa bay made several rushes down the ice bishop was pulled from the net to gain an extra attacker , but it was for naught the blackhawks held steady and took the first game of the series we really did n't give them much the entire game , lightning coach jon cooper said did they have a little bit more puck possession in the third period \? they did there s no question could we have made a few more poised plays \? i suppose we could have we had chances to put them away , and we did n't put them away the lighting have been something of a sleeper team in the playoffs despite finishing the regular season with 108 points , the best home record in the nhl and the highestscoring offense while stamkos is undoubtedly their marquee player , their roster is stocked with young players like tyler johnson , the leading goal scorer in the playoffs , and palat , who have gained widespread attention only recently perhaps the lightning s lack of prominence has helped them in their quest to become the first team in nhl history to beat four original six franchises in one playoff run after a tightly fought opening series against the detroit red wings that went seven games , the lightning defeated the montreal canadiens in six games and then outlasted the rangers , winning the seventh and deciding game at madison square garden but winning in the playoffs is often about minimizing mistakes , and the young lightning made a few too many mistakes in their own zone the blackhawks , who have played 112 postseason games since 2009 , showed on wednesday that they had experience turning mistakes into opportunities
the and opened the world series on tuesday night the way fox would like to script every game 1 a 14inning epic that should build the audience for subsequent games as with any serial , whether gene autry s westerns or the podcast serial , people look forward to the next chapter if the first one engages them game 1 gave baseball a good name and raised hopes for the quality of the following ones it had a star like the mets' matt harvey laboring beyond his famous innings limit it had the rarity of alcides escobar s insidethepark home run that started kansas city s scoring in the first inning \( and permitted us to reflect upon similar feats by mule haas and patsy dougherty \) it had a gametying , bottomoftheninth home run by alex gordon and five extra innings that were simultaneously tense and interminable until the royals won , 54 and , fox s power outage brief , but maddening gave the game another memorable element in the end , an average of 149 million people were watching , the best audience for the first game of the world series since 2010 , but fewer than episodes this season of ncis , the big bang theory , empire , 60 minutes and a bunch of nfl games there was a time some of us were even alive for it when multiples of tuesday s world series audience watched the games and it is a lovely coincidence that the two mostwatched world series games on record were played by recent ancestors of the mets and the royals game 6 , 1980 the philadelphia phillies won the series , 42 , over the royals before 549 million viewers watching on nbc sixty percent of the households in the united states watching tv at that time were tuned to steve carlton and tug mcgraw pitching the phillies to a 41 win game 7 , 1986 an average of 521 million people watched the mets beat the , 85 , at shea stadium , against competition like monday night football \( the giants beat the redskins \) , newhart and cagney lacey those numbers do not happen anymore at the world series , thanks largely to the availability of hundreds of tv channels , the internet , gaming , scrapbooking and who knows what else still , the series remains highly ranked among primetime shows since ratings have skidded for years for all of them there is just so much more to do these days how many people who might watch the series are now tending their facebook pages or streaming the walking dead \? but carrying on , as if inoculated from the cultural and technological changes that have afflicted most television programming , is the nfl after its conference championship games averaged 461 million viewers last season , the super bowl s audience continued to climb to a gaudy 1144 million and those are not aberrations an argument can be made that baseball , with its long season and heavy local broadcasting of games , is stronger regionally than nationally , diminishing the allure of any world series in which your team is not involved and the recent trend of putting nearly every league championship series game on cable , and not broadcast television , has probably facilitated the downward trend of world series viewership over the past 11 years , only 10 world series games have drawn more than 20 million viewers four came in the fiveday stretch when the red sox swept the st louis cardinals in 2004 , the first world series victory for boston in 86 years games are likelier to bring in 14 million or 15 million viewers in the 1990s , 32 games drew at least 20 million , and a dozen attracted at least 30 million an analysis of world series viewership patterns yields these thoughts if a series reaches its full length , game 7 is likely to produce a surge of viewers in 2011 , none of the first five games of the texasst louis series had been seen by more than 151 million people the final two were witnessed by 21 million and 254 million , respectively madison bumgarner s pitching for the giants last year , highlighted by his fiveinning relief stint in game 7 , gave a series that might have been the leastwatched on record an injection of 235 million viewers in the finale a big market like new york is desired by a network like fox because it has so many people and a large builtin fan base for the mets or yankees but it was better for the yankees to play in a great series like the one in 2001 against arizona soon after the 9 11 attacks \( which 245 million watched \) than the one in 2000 against the mets \( 181 million \) because it only tapped into the fan passion of one region six years since the yankees' last world series appearance in 2009 , it is worth watching to see if the metsroyals series can match the audience of 194 million that took in the yankees' sixgame victory over the phillies a midwest team like the royals that attracted large audiences in the 1980s , before the explosion of entertainment options that have eroded traditional tvwatching , probably needs a big market opponent and a riveting series to avoid a modest audience like last year s san francisco is the nation s no 6 market but new york is nearly three times as large central to viewership , large or small , is allowing people to see the games without interruption fox said it brought in two new generators in time for game 2 on wednesday night to replace the ones that malfunctioned tuesday night and caused it to piggyback on the generators that mlb international uses to send out its world feed an autopsy on the faulty generators has not found a reason for their failure
the brightly creepy opening scene of gives you what you want in the television equivalent of a beach read while children cavort on an idyllic suburban lawn , one little girl stands off to the side talking to her imaginary friend having received her instructions , she goes in the house and gathers the tools a hammer , a saw that she 'll need to build a booby trap designed to kill her mother it s the best moment in the early episodes of the show , an abc summer series that begins on monday night , and it s no coincidence that it s the closest the show comes to the mood and substance of the 1951 short story , zero hour , on which it s based the story is a vignette that communicates horror in a casual , suggestive fashion we , like the distracted parent from whose point of view it s told , only gradually realize that america s children have been lured into facilitating an alien invasion using cutlery and other household goods turning a 10page short story into a tv series requires a lot of renovation and expansion , and in that process most of the bradbury lyricism has been lost the whispers throws in marital drama , nuclear sabotage and the fbi , and it has to literalize the invaders , who now manipulate electricity and can snatch a fighter jet out of the sky none of this narrative padding is especially gripping , and some of it borders on dull , but the quality of the construction is above average the show was created by soo hugh , who was a writer and producer on under the dome , and in the early going it s scarier and more credible than that cbs summer series , which returns for a third season this month it also has the advantage of starring the excellent as the fbi agent investigating the multiplying cases of imaginaryfriendinspired violence , and a pair of wideeyed but spooky actresses , abby ryder fortson and kylie rogers , as two of the suggestible children if you 're a fan of village of the damned , it s enough to know that they would have fit right in

toronto somewhere beneath the easy demeanor and the casual confidence he carries to the pitcher s mound , there must be a luis severino with sweaty palms , knocking knees and jittery nerves because 21yearold pitchers , fresh from the minor leagues , are not supposed to carry themselves the way severino has in three starts for the  not when that first start is at yankee stadium against the red sox and the next is after a dispiriting sweep at home and the third is against baseball s most perilous lineup in front of 46 , 792 boisterous fans on sunday , severino once again delivered a performance beyond his years and came away emptyhanded betrayed by right fielder carlos beltran , who lost a fly ball in the sun by a couple of errant sliders , which were punished by two of the best hitters in baseball and by the continuing silence of the yankees' bats , which provided him little support in a 31 loss it dropped severino s record to 02 and raised his earned run average to 318 , but those numbers seem to be matters of circumstance with a fastball that danced with late movement and touched 98 miles per hour on occasion , he struck out nine in six innings and allowed only three balls to be hit out of the infield severino , who shattered three bats against the cleveland indians last week , appeared to break two more manager joe girardi said before sunday s game that he had looked for signs of anxiety in severino s first two starts but could see none he s hard to read , you know \? girardi said so far , he s got a pretty good poker face severino kept it during his most trying moment sunday after beltran lost a soft fly ball in the sun in the third inning , severino hung a couple of sliders one was driven to right for a runscoring single by josh donaldson the other was driven over the wall by jose bautista but severino did not hang his head the mistakes seemed to be mechanical failures rather than emotional ones asked if he noticed a change in severino s demeanor after beltran s misadventure , catcher brian mccann said not at all his makeup is off the charts as he said after the loss to boston , when he gave up a prodigious home run to david ortiz , severino reiterated the difference between the majors and the minors the mistakes here get punished i knew right away when i saw the pitch , severino said through an interpreter , referring to the slider he threw to bautista it was high , and i knew it was going to be a problem in the first inning , severino was called for a balk when trying to quickpitch edwin encarnacion , advancing bautista to second bautista then darted toward third base , hoping to force another balk or steal third instead , severino calmly stepped off the pitching rubber and threw to second baseman stephen drew , who slapped a tag on the embarrassed bautista thus far , severino has done little to make general manager brian cashman look foolhardy for refusing to part with him in any trade package to acquire a frontline starter severino has used all his pitches effectively fastball , two types of sliders and a changeup and made ingame adjustments in a veteran clubhouse , it is one thing to recognize potential , but on a club that fancies itself as a championship contender , there is an appreciation of what severino can do for it now as good as advertised , said c c sabathia , who made his debut at age 20 andrew miller , who made his debut at 21 , said he had been nowhere near as polished as severino is now everybody fakes it to some extent , but he s certainly had a sense of calm and being in control , which is not always natural for people , miller said obviously , he s got confidence in his stuff , and rightly so i'm sure it helped that he was pitching well when he got called up even if it s the minor leagues , having a little momentum does n't hurt even though it s been a brief time , he seems like the real deal
the morning after the third deadly mass shooting in six weeks , the presidential candidates acted as though they had not seen the news republicans attacked over the personal email account she used as secretary of state mrs clinton went ahead with a planned speech about tax policy senator , a rival democrat , talked about children s issues in iowa only gov of louisiana , speaking at a news conference outside the movie theater where three people were , addressed the violence at length but mr jindal , who is mounting a longshot candidacy for the republican nomination , completely deflected questions on tougher gun laws , saying he would talk about policy and politics another time , and telling reporters to focus on the victims , survivors and the heroic police officers who had responded to the shooting though most denounced the shooting and called for prayers for the victims as they did after recent shootings in , tenn , and , sc none of the presidential contenders offered policy solutions to address gun violence , a reflection of the fact that gun laws are politically radioactive the leading republican presidential candidates are overwhelmingly opposed to any effort to restrict access to guns , and have responded to the string of recent shootings by focusing on depending on the nature of the shooting spiritual healing , the threat of islamic terrorism and mental health efforts the democratic hopefuls have proposed gun control measures , but they have been generally more focused on issues of economics , race and gender than gun violence in the wake of thursday s attack , mrs clinton made sure to acknowledge that gun ownership is part of the fabric of many american communities , before urging broad policies to address gun violence we must come together for common sense gun violence prevention reforms that keep weapons out of the hands of criminals and the violently unstable , while respecting responsible gun owners , she said in a statement that was unlikely to offer encouragement to proponents of stricter gun laws mrs clinton has , however , called for universal background checks and stronger efforts to block those who are on terrorist watch lists , suffer from mental illness , or have records of domestic abuse from obtaining firearms though mr sanders seems to be gaining ground based largely on the support of liberal voters , he is compromised on the issue of guns in a way that mrs clinton is not the vermont senator has previously been backed by the national rifle association and has argued on the campaign trail that guns in his home state , or in rural new hampshire , are not the equivalent of guns in major urban areas like chicago mr sanders s campaign noted friday that he supports instant background checks , tighter restrictions on gun shows and has a dismal rating from the nra among the democratic contenders , only martin o'malley , who wrote late friday , made a forceful call for congress to pass more restrictive gun measures strategists in both parties say that , regardless of who wins the white house next year , there is little chance for passing gun legislation because republicans , who will almost certainly still control the house , will not bring any bills restricting gun access up for a vote the only times in recent american history when significant gun control bills were signed into law 1968 , 1993 and 1994 were when democrats controlled the presidency and both chambers of congress although president obama said this week that the failure to persuade congress to pass common sense gun safety laws was one of the great regrets of his presidency just hours before the shooting in louisiana congress is unlikely to close any of the loopholes in federal gun laws exposed by the recent shootings the bill in congress with the most traction may be one that would give military officers the ability to carry weapons at recruitment centers where congress has faltered , the states have moved to tighten safety aspects of gun ownership for instance , 10 states have made it harder for people with domestic violence convictions to obtain weapons court records show that the and had once been the subject of a protective order in carroll county , ga , which may have been detected with a stronger mental health reporting systems that too is the subject of legislation languishing in congress nearly 20 states and the district of columbia now have universal background check laws similar to a measure that failed in the last congress , which may have blocked or at least slowed the gun purchase of mohammod youssuf abdulazeez , who law enforcement officials say shot and killed four united states marines and one sailor at a military recruitment center in chattanooga mr abdulazeez bought his weapon on the internet , an avenue that senate legislation in the last congress intended to make subject to background checks the man who the police say killed nine charleston churchgoers had not completed his background check , but he was allowed to buy a gun anyway under a socalled default proceed federal law permits a firearms dealer who has initiated a background check to proceed with a sale if the dealer has not been notified of violations within three business days representative james e clyburn , democrat of south carolina , that would close the loophole , but republican leaders have not acted on it in the case of the chattanooga killings , some of the candidates called for letting members of the military and national guard , a move codified by bills pending in congress this week , defense secretary ashton b carter responded coolly to the idea we need to recruit , but we ca n't put people at unnecessary risk as well , he said , saying that he would await the recommendations of commanders , and then i 'll make decisions sometime in the next few days no single law usually could have prevented mass shootings , which remain rare gun violence experts are increasingly interested in changing laws to better target those who have a demonstrated propensity for gun violence for instance , a nonviolent felony conviction from two decades ago may well be less predictive of gun violence than a domestic violence protection order or drunkendriving conviction , said daniel webster , director of the johns hopkins center for gun policy and research there is very little research that says what the best gun policy is to prevent mass shootings , mr webster said but we do have a good amount of research to show that when you have higher standards for legal gun ownership and more robust efforts to prevent prohibited persons from accessing guns , you have much lower rates of gun violence a lot of people have a hard time believing that because you never see a news story that some dangerous person did n't kill someone today because they did n't get a gun
the first bric jazzfest reached peak solidarity near midnight on thursday , during a relentlessly ecstatic performance by kamasi washington roaring through his tenor saxophone against the rolling tumult of his band , mr washington imparted an air of mystic urgency to the bric house ballroom in downtown brooklyn the room was at capacity , and the crowd felt perfectly tuned in to his message , calling out with congregational fervor this was the superheated closing set of a fivehour jazz marathon that formed the festival s core attraction though bric jazzfest encompassed a few standalone concerts earlier in the week , by the bassist ron carter and others , it put most of its stock in the multistage , rovingaudience model , with nine bands in overlapping sets on thursday , and nine more planned for friday the bounty suited an event presented in association with the \( that word again \) , and by and large , it was a remarkably smooth success tickets were 30 at the door , with a capacity of 700 \( thursday s marathon sold out \) yet the experience felt comfortable and manageable , rather than cramped or harried the sound was firstrate at each of three stages , and drifting among them was easy \( the coziest , the artist studio , had been configured like a club , and there was often a line to get in the door call that a problem , if you like \) the music ran strictly on time a lot of musicians stuck around after their sets to hear their peers none of this should be taken for granted but , in a sense , it might have been expected the powers behind bric jazzfest have experience with this sort of thing bric is the nonprofit that presents celebrate brooklyn ! at prospect park every summer , among much else and one of the producers of the festival is brice rosenbloom , who founded the winter jazzfest , and has more or less turned the marathon ideal into a prevailing standard for jazz festivals in new york the winter jazzfest happens in midjanuary in greenwich village its has just been announced , as was often mentioned from the stage at bric house but when it began in 2005 , it was contained within the knitting factory , then a threestory structure in tribeca so the bric marathon felt like a fond look back \( with , it should be noted , brighter , cleaner facilities \) as well as a welcome new development just how welcome \? given what s still a limited infrastructure for jazz in brooklyn , bric jazzfest could be an important force for good near the start of his festival set , the bassist ben williams introduced his band , sound effect , and said they 'd played many times in manhattan but never in brooklyn , until now their performance on a gallery floor that bric house calls the stoop , with stadium seating sloping down from the lobby was pleasing , crisp and relaxed mr williams and his partners , especially the saxophonist marcus strickland and the keyboardist david bryant , made their cooledout version of jazzfunk feel inarguable , like a fait accompli but then , maybe that was the effect of the booking on thursday , which suggested a tyranny of style i heard parts of every set , encountering an abundance of contemporary genreblending , an overspill of smart proficiency and very little music that seems likely to stay with me at its least convincing as in the tart , mugging jazzrb of the los angeles singer dessy di lauro , who calls her style neoragtime the lineup felt calculating , pitched to an imagined crossover base even some of the stronger sets , like one by the trumpeter takuya kuroda , whose band sounded like the brecker brothers with a new operating system , were hobbled by context what could be so special about one more group hunkering down with a groove \? so there could have been more variety , more call to introspection , more art that challenged the audience \( friday s scheduled lineup , which included the bands thumbscrew and boom tic boom , had the upper hand in that regard \) one of the more distinctive offerings came from the harpist brandee younger , who led a quartet with poise and commitment her set included compositions by two of her personal touchstones , alice coltrane and dorothy ashby , and was stronger for it there was also highimpact fusion from the tenor saxophonist donny mccaslin , and indiestylized jazzrock from the keyboardist kris bowers and , in a separate set , the guitarist nir felder and dawn of midi enacted its signature transfiguration of electronic music by acoustic means , in a hypnotic , mutedpercussive performance whose dimensions kept morphing sometimes by accretion , sometimes by subtraction , always with an icy sobriety it was an impressive feat of concentration that stayed almost entirely near the surface a similar condition plagued the much more expansive set by mr washington , who has been the subject of more glowing press this year than any new arrival in jazz s recent history flanked , as usual , by two churning drummers , he muscled through a series of anthems from the epic , his triple album on brainfeeder his fellow saxophonist , terrace martin , joined the band for a sustained sprint through final thought , and the trombonist ryan porter had his say almost every solo , including one on keytar by the pianist brandon coleman , held to a frantic , filibustering cadence and the band dynamic , which has at other recent shows , felt rote in its clamor superhero jazz without a clear mission , except the will to draw applause
washington in this republican presidential campaign , middecember is not as late as it used to be stand by for changes donald j trump atop opinion polls for months , but several factors have injected greater uncertainty than normal at this stage of the campaign the first is simply the dates of the iowa caucuses \( feb 1 \) and the new hampshire primary \( feb 9 \) , the latest for those contests in 20 years and a month deeper into the campaign than in the past two presidential races the primary calendar in 2008 and 2012 meant that voter preferences were more clearly formed by the middle of december polls taken in late december by , considered the most accurate assessment of iowa opinion , accurately predicted and , in which he tied for first place this time , the homestretch for campaigning , phone calls and television ads will run through january , culminating in the final debate before iowa , on jan 28 on fox news in the most recent iowa poll , in late october , 78 percent of those planning to caucus indicated they might yet change their minds extraordinary fluidity , said j ann selzer , who conducts the poll for the register and bloomberg news half of the likely caucusgoers , she noted , said they were still considering eight or more options in the crowded republican field the second factor is the nature of that field the two men with the most national support so far , mr trump and the retired neurosurgeon ben carson , are unorthodox candidates whose ability to secure voter turnout is unproved their more conventional rivals have electoral track records in large states like florida \( former gov jeb bush and senator marco rubio \) , new jersey \( gov chris christie \) , ohio \( gov john r kasich \) and texas \( senator ted cruz \) yet none is as familiar to national republican audiences as senator john mccain was in 2008 or mr romney in 2012 a third factor is liveinterview telephone polls , widely accepted as the most accurate method of political polling , have become costlier and more difficult because so many americans now decline to participate online and automatedphone surveys are less expensive , but the results tend to diverge from those of telephone interviews mr trump , for example , fares better among online respondents the problem is magnified for primary elections with lower turnout it s hard to figure out who s going to actually show up , said daron shaw , a former data analyst for george w bush s presidential campaigns who helps conduct polling for fox news , referring to voters outside iowa and new hampshire , where candidates have been visiting repeatedly , people are n't paying that much attention to the race yet relatively modest shifts that occur late in those two states can have a powerful influence elsewhere the most drastic example came in 1984 when gary hart , after finishing second in the 1984 iowa caucuses , was transformed from alsoran to principal challenger to walter f mondale in the race for the democratic nomination within eight days , mr hart in new hampshire and won the primary there mr mondale ultimately prevailed , but mainstream republican strategists say they believe on faith if not evidence that the nominee will be whoever emerges as the principal challenger to mr trump in new hampshire , where mr trump holds a substantial lead , there is an intense competition for second place among candidates who remain bunched together this week , the average of polls there showed mr rubio with 12 percent , mr christie with 6 percent , and mr bush , mr cruz and mr kasich in between that competition still has nine weeks to play out voters are well aware of when the election really is , said thomas d rath , a longtime republican activist in new hampshire who backs mr kasich voters know when they have to lock down , and it is not yet
between 1936 and 1939 , the spanish civil war condensed the awful drama of the 1930s into one conflict spain was where leftwing illusions about stalinism went to die , where hitler s war machine tuned up for the blitzkrieg , where aerial bombardments of civilians and politicallymotivated cleansing were normalized it was a proxy war for the totalitarian powers , a magnet for volunteers from around the western world , and an object lesson in the impotence of europe s liberal democracies as with spain , so now with syria once again we have a divided country bled by an ideological proxy war this time between the salafism of the gulf states and the twelver shi'ism of the iranian regime , with other regional and global powers hovering in the background once again we have the escalating atrocities chemical warfare , massacres and religious persecutions , the return of beheadings , slavery and crucifixion once again we have ideologically motivated volunteers rushing in from far and wide once again we have liberal powers seemingly helpless to bring the conflict to an end but then there is this illuminating difference the spanish civil war actually ended relatively swiftly after less than three years of fighting franco s nationalists had won the syrian conflict , though , is in its fifth year and counting , and its ultimate outcome is no clearer today than it was in 2012 or 2014 in part , this difference is actually a grim sort of good news not for syria , obviously , but for the world one reason spain s civil war ended quickly was the sheer effectiveness of the military aid the axis powers sent to the nationalist cause spain proved \( or seemed to prove \) the effectiveness of total war as a tool of ideologicallymotivated statecraft the left was crushed , franco s regime established , and looking from afar adolf hitler could draw an obvious lesson for his own terrible ambitions in syria , the lessons are very different the war is endless , the factions barely competent , and neither of the main ideological forces invested in the conflict seem capable of actually winning it the iranian mullahs have helped president bashar alassad survive , but not to prosper the gulf states have lost control over their own sunni proxies , and now face an islamic state that threatens them as well this means that neither tehran nor riyadh can look at syria and see a template for regional expansion or grand ideological victory and that , in turn , makes a middle eastern version of the massive conflict that followed the spanish civil war seem relatively unlikely for all their ambitions and enmity , neither the iranians nor the gulf states \( who are currently hiring to fight their other proxy war , in yemen \) look anywhere near strong enough to start one of the powers involved in syria that strong enough to start a wider war , meanwhile russia , the united states , france and turkey it s not at all clear what they would hope to get out of it the west can barely decide which syrian faction we should be bombing russia s brinksmanship with turkey is a show of toughness with no clear strategic objective attached that does n't make a blundering sort of war impossible but unlike in ukraine , where vladimir putin does aspire to hold territory , in syria and its environs none of the outside powers seem to want responsibility for anything and so long as there s no ground they 're willing to fight over or even occupy , the risk of sustained great power conflict seems moderately remote which is happy news relative to where things stood in europe as the spanish civil war was winding down but if syria is \( probably \) not a harbinger of a fullscale third world war , it is a harbinger of a different set of evils institutional collapse , permanent disorder , and the inability of global institutions to master the problems that they supposedly exist to solve if the war in spain previewed an era of totalitarian aggrandizement , the war in syria has exposed the essential hollowness of socalled nationstates , the ease with which ethnic and religious furies can take over when they crack if the war in spain was a proving ground for eastern frontstyle total war , the war in syria is a training ground for parisstyle terrorists if the war in spain ushered in a decade of vast militaries on the march , the war in syria is giving us civilians on the march the movement of refugees as a geopolitical crisis if the war in spain demonstrated that hitler and stalin were happy to step in when a liberal center failed to hold , the war in syria demonstrates that the pax americana is cracking and power or alliance is remotely prepared to take its place if the war in spain was a dress rehearsal for world war ii well , the truth about syria is that it s probably not a rehearsal for anything it s the main event , and nobody can foresee when it will end
s eulogy for the rev clementa c pinckney of the emanuel african methodist episcopal church in charleston , sc , was remarkable not only because the president sang the opening refrain of amazing grace on live television , and not only because of his eloquence in memorializing the pastor and eight other parishioners it was also remarkable because the eulogy drew on all of mr obama s gifts of language and empathy and searching intellect first glimpsed in dreams from my father , his deeply felt 1995 memoir about identity and family and because it used those gifts to talk about the complexities of race and justice , situating them within an echoing continuum in time that reflected both mr obama s own long view of history , and the panoramic vision of america , shared by abraham lincoln and the rev dr martin luther king jr , as a country in the process of perfecting itself mr obama s view of the nation s history as a more than twocentury journey to make the promises of the declaration of independence \( that all men are created equal \) real for everyone , his former chief speechwriter , jon favreau , suggested in an email , is both an american and a religious sentiment predicated upon the belief that individual sinners and a country scarred by the original sin of slavery can overcome the past through persistent , courageous , sometimes frustrating efforts for mr obama , america is a constant work in progress , a nation founded upon the idea of new beginnings , and the enduring belief , as he once about lincoln , that we can constantly remake ourselves to fit our larger dreams like his two moving speeches in selma , ala , in 2007 and this year , mr obama s eulogy used the prism of history to amplify and crystallize the meaning of the occasion a wideangle lens that reminds us of the distance we 've come from the days of slavery , segregation and jim crow , and the distance we have yet to travel in addressing enduring prejudice and inequities these are themes that have animated mr obama s writings and oratory for years , going back to his 2004 address and 2008 speech , to his 2013 the 1963 march on washington history , he believes , is an odyssey , a crossing , a relay in which one generation s achievements serve as the paving stones for the next generation s journey in his eulogy on june 26 , mr obama of charleston s mother emanuel how a church built by blacks seeking liberty was burned to the ground because its founders sought to end slavery and how it rose again , a phoenix from these ashes , to become a sacred place where dr king would preach from its pulpit he spoke of how history must be a manual to avoid repeating the mistakes of the past while building a roadway toward a better world this looking back at what has been overcome and looking forward toward a better tomorrow is a bedrock tradition in the black church which , having borne witness to so much suffering , looks to the promised land ahead and it is a fundamental theme in the sermons of dr king , who talked in his great speech of hewing out of the mountain of despair a stone of hope , of transforming the jangling discords of our nation into a beautiful symphony of brotherhood mr obama , like dr king , is fond of quoting the words of the 19thcentury minister and abolitionist the arc of the moral universe is long , but it bends toward justice in grappling with the wounds of the civil war , lincoln similarly looked to the broad vistas of history and the lessons of scripture both for solace and as a way of framing and universalizing his own arguments in the , he effectively redefined the founders' vision of america and how we read the constitution and declaration of independence , and in his , he recognized the sin of slavery and the terrible scourge of war that was part of its price , and at the same time , sought to bind up the nation s wounds , to find a way forward with malice toward none , with charity for all lincoln s second inaugural was on the mind of mr obama s chief speechwriter , cody keenan , when he was preparing a first draft of the charleston eulogy he spoke with the president on june 22 about the speech and hoped to emulate lincoln s tone of reconciliation and healing like many classical eulogies , the narrative begins by memorializing the dead , then addresses the tasks remaining for the living exhorting the congregation and the nation , as lincoln put it , to finish the work we are in a draft of the charleston eulogy was given to the president around 5 pm on june 25 and , according to mr keenan , mr obama spent some five hours revising it that evening , not merely jotting notes in the margins , but whipping out the yellow legal pads he likes to write on only the second time he s done so for a speech in the last two years he would rewrite large swaths of the text mr obama expanded on a short riff in the draft about the idea of grace , and made it the central theme of the eulogy the grace family members of the shooting victims embodied in the forgiveness they expressed toward the killer the grace the city of charleston and the state of south carolina manifested in coming together in the wake of the massacre the grace god bestowed in transforming a tragedy into an occasion for renewal , sorrow into hope as he s done in his most powerful earlier work , mr obama drew upon his own knowledge of scripture and literature and history much the way lincoln and dr king did in their writings to create a musical narrative that uses biblical and historical allusions to widen the dimensions of his storytelling , while moving between the vernacular and the metaphorical , between particular issues \( inequities in the criminal justice system , the need for gun control , the hurt and hate represented by the confederate battle flag \) and larger moral and spiritual imperatives he also inserted lines from his favorite hymn , amazing grace , as a refrain , and , on the way to charleston aboard , he told his advisers that he might sing some of those lines if it feels right it did feel right mr obama , now in the final quarter of his presidency , has grown increasingly assertive and outspoken about issues close to his heart in a recent interview with the comedian marc maron , he spoke of how experience and the fearlessness that comes from having survived being in the barrel tumbling down niagara falls have brought a sense of liberation at the same time , the eulogy he delivered that friday afternoon in charleston turned out to be the capstone to a dizzying and momentous week in which southern politicians began calling for a renunciation of the confederate battle flag , while the supreme court upheld the affordable care act and found that the constitution guarantees a right to  it was a week in which a lot of americans felt they were actually watching the arc of history bend in front of their eyes , and it was a eulogy that both spoke to the moment and connected that moment to the past and the future of what mr obama calls the great american experiment
in october , a scandal broke at one of south africa s most prestigious private boarding schools a group of boys from hilton college in the kwazulunatal province the white and black sons of south africa s elite had taken a of themselves participating in a mock gang rape and it ended up on instagram their victim was a boy dressed in the school uniform of st anne s diocesan college , a nearby girls' boarding school while the scene was captured in a curiously modern fashion , its implied brutality was as old as time there was a small public uproar , but it soon died down the boys no more than a slap on the wrist for their staging of a simulated rape none were expelled i thought about that picture again this month , when oscar pistorius guilty of murdering his girlfriend , reeva steenkamp , after a south african appeals court overturned last year s manslaughter verdict against him mr pistorius , who went to an elite high school in pretoria , has much in common with those privileged hilton students south african boys of their class seem raised to believe that they can get away with egregious acts of violent misogyny until recently , mr pistorius appeared , like them , to have escaped censure because he is such a singular figure the double amputee who became an athletic phenomenon , competing for his postapartheid country against ablebodied athletes in the 2012 olympics it has been easy to see mr pistorius as an exceptional figure but viewed in context , his violence toward his partner makes him seem not unique but entirely a product of his south africanness of course , not all south african men are violent , but an extraordinarily high proportion are according to a 2009 survey by south africa s based on more than 1 , 700 interviews , more than one in four men admitted to rape , and of those , 46 percent said that they had raped more than once earlier research , conducted in three of south africa s nine provinces , that between about a fifth and a quarter of women had been physically abused by their intimate partners violence against women is often pathologized as a black issue , or a problem of poverty , in south africa but the stories of mr pistorius and the hilton boys , as well as the statistics , suggest that sexual violence crosses boundaries of race and class the global auditing firm kpmg in 2014 that genderbased violence costs the south african economy about 3 billion a year \( calculated at the time of the report \) , or roughly 1 percent of gross domestic product , in a country struggling to achieve economic growth despite this , south africa does not have a coherent national strategy aimed at preventing the epidemic of violence over the last 20 years , the government has passed a slew of laws aimed at punishing perpetrators of rape and intimatepartner abuse , but it has failed to root out the culture that permits violence against women in another society , the conviction of mr pistorius might serve as a turning point a moment when public desire to end violence lines up with the government s desire to fix the underlying issues that cause violence but not here there is evidence that when boys are consistently taught to respect women and girls , over time their behavior improves for example , a program in south africa known as the study has found that combining gender training with microfinance initiatives \( to empower women economically \) has been enormously successful intimate partner violence by 55 percent in the rural province where the project had its trial yet south africa lacks political leadership on the issue last year , the government of president jacob g zuma appointed susan shabangu as minister of women in a previous post , as deputy safety and security minister in 2008 , ms shabangu was heavily for urging police officers to shoot to kill criminal suspects four years later , she was the mining minister during the monthslong labor dispute that led to the marikana massacre , in which the police 34 miners this hardly seems a good r sum for an official tasked with reducing violence , in the home or otherwise others in the nonprofit sector who are better qualified find their efforts hampered by the overwhelming demand for services gender violence projects are also not easy to win funding for although south africa is classified as a middleincome country , activists found themselves in the absurd situation last year of having to to international donors to keep open the doors of the country s oldest center for rape survivors frustrations mounted when , soon after taking office , ms shabangu a national council that had been working on a plan to end genderbased violence initiatives like schoolbased training and education , adding more social workers and domestic violence shelters , and plans for privatesector funding of call centers and cellphone hotlines have been shelved the minister s attitude and her department s abysmal lack of direction have disappointed activists who had hoped that a spate of highprofile deaths of women like anene booysens , a 17yearold whose brutal rape , killing and mutilation the nation in 2013 , and a model whose murder case was tried in the courtroom next to mr pistorius s last year , would provide new political impetus south africans ca n't afford to be disheartened every day , on average , 118 women report to the police that they had been raped and every day , three women at the hands of a partner that is the south africa of mr pistorius mr pistorius may have failed , finally , to get away with murder but as long as there are boys growing up who , like the hilton college students , think rape is a joke , activists have no choice but to continue their campaign with or without government backing
sacramento with president obama back from a in which he portrayed the fight against as an urgent international priority , california is showing how hard it can be even in a state overwhelmingly controlled by democrats to get an ambitious carbon reduction bill passed the state has been at the forefront of global efforts to battle greenhouse gases , enacting mandates to force sharp reductions in emissions over the next 35 years its environmental record was applauded by mr obama last week , and pope francis invited gov to discuss the fight against in the vatican this summer but a centerpiece of california s longterm campaign against emissions legislation requiring a 50 percent reduction in petroleum use by jan 1 , 2030 has set off a fierce battle here , pitting not only a wellfinanced against environmentalists , but democrat against democrat the bill easily passed the senate , but it is faltering in the assembly because of opposition by moderate democrats , many representing economically suffering districts in central california a vote is expected early this coming week the legislation faces an onslaught by the western states petroleum association and other advocates that , in ads and mailings , assert that a 50 percent cut in petroleum use could result in gas rationing and a ban on minivans this law will limit how often we can drive our own cars , a narrator in one advertisement urgently , an assertion the bill s sponsors say is groundless the oil industry has tagged the bill the california gas restriction act of 2015 a defeat would be a setback for mr brown , who has made a battle against global warming a centerpiece of his final years in public life , and for environmentalists who have looked to california to lead the emissions fight at a time of strong skepticism about global warming in washington mr obama urged california lawmakers to enact the bill in a recent speech in las vegas , signaling the importance he is attaching to the issue in his final years in office the environmental fight here comes on the eve of the conference in paris , set to take place in the fall there , mr brown and kevin de le n , the state senate democratic leader who led the fight for the bill in his chamber , are planning to outline for an international audience california s campaign against greenhouse gases on wednesday , the legislature passed and sent to mr brown a measure requiring the state s public pension funds to divest from coal companies the rest of the world is watching very closely what is happening in california , and i think so far they see a success story , mr de le n said our economy has grown we are adding jobs , and we are reducing our carbon emissions therefore it is absolutely crucial that this measure passes , because it will be a big blow to the rest of the states and the whole world if it does n't california has mandated an 80 percent cut in emissions by 2050 , using 1990 emissions levels as a baseline the goal has been championed by democrats like mr brown and republicans like former gov arnold schwarzenegger this bill on petroleum , one of several the legislature is voting on to put these limits in place , is intended to ensure that california meets its target the legislation , leaves it to the state s air resources board to determine how the 50 percent mandate would be met it does not mention gas rationing or a ban on minivans it also includes no penalties in case the mandate is missed opponents , in defending the warnings about rationing , noted that the bill is short on specifics on how the reduction would be achieved they said they saw no other way the mandate could be met i ca n't figure out any other way to reach a 50 percent reduction in that frame without doing some pretty dramatic measures , said catherine reheisboyd , the president of the western states petroleum association if it is n't gas rationing , what is it \? i keep hearing what it is n't mr brown said in an interview in his office here that the oil industry was using fear tactics to try to derail the effort before the legislature adjourns on friday , but that he was confident of eventual success you 've got the oil companies fighting pope francis , he said fighting the scientists of the world fighting the governor of california they are engaged in literally a lifeanddeath struggle , and i have no doubt who is going to be the victor he added it s a shameless effort to maintain their revenue stream regardless of what the impact is on everyone else there is no rationing in the bill read it none the concerns have come not only from republicans , but also from moderate democrats who represent communities in central california many of these communities are struggling with high unemployment and slow economic growth so much of our economy is driven by the use of petroleum , said assemblyman henry t perea , a democrat from the central valley and a leader of moderates in his house we do n't know what impacts sb 350 will have on it we do n't know because we do n't know what the plan is what does that look like \? we have n't heard that answer to that and in the absence of information , you create your own kristin olsen , the assembly republican leader , said her party was eager to find ways to curb harmful emissions my son has asthma of course i want clean air , she said but she questioned why california had to be a leader in an effort that she argued had such significant economic costs we want to be leaders , she said , but not when there are no followers and at some point we have to look at the fact that no one is following california s lead we are less than 1 percent of the world at some point we should work on reasonable , costeffective measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to improve our air quality but not at the cost of jobs ms boyd of the petroleum association said the bill s sponsors had erred in trying to push the measure through without explaining how it might work we think there should be a lot more detail , she said , and it should be articulated pretty clearly about how one thinks they are going to be about this superaggressive mandate backers of the bill said reductions would be achieved by , among other things , bolstering the fuel efficiency of existing cars and increasing the number of on the roads , while pushing urban planning policies that help enable people to walk to their jobs and to shopping districts we do n't have a choice we have to make these changes , said tom steyer , a billionaire hedge fund manager and environmental advocate who has been championing the bill in listening to these people talk about how there is going to be rationing , i'm like , stop making up stories , and start telling us what will happen under your scenario' we are in the process of changing how we use energy in the united states of america , mr steyer added the way this happens is , the private sector comes up with new ideas , and people either like them or not mr de le n , the leader of the state senate democrats , said he was preparing amendments to his bill to try to ease concerns one amendment would give the legislature more say over the final recommendation by the air resources board even if the bill fails , mr brown said , enough other legislation is already in place that he is confident of longterm victory this is not the whole battle , he said this bill has become a lightning rod it s important but california is way down the road in terms of the thrust and momentum that has been building up for over a decade
zurich soccer s world governing body will hold a presidential election friday , two days after a group of its leading officials were charged with corruption , its headquarters were raided and the governments of two countries announced they were investigating more allegations of bribery but when the voting members of fifa cast their ballots on friday , it most likely will be as if nothing had happened this week sepp blatter , the publicly embattled leader seeking a fifth term as fifa s president , shows no signs of political damage despite a new round of allegations of widespread bribery implicating some of his top lieutenants , 11 of whom from soccer , mr blatter is expected to handily defeat his only challenger on thursday , in his first public comments since the scandal became public , mr blatter , 79 , used a speech opening fifa s annual congress to deflect responsibility for fifa s problems and simultaneously suggest he was willing and able to solve them we , or i , cannot monitor everyone all of the time , mr blatter said if people want to do wrong , they will also try to hide it but it must also fall to me to be responsible for the reputation of our entire organization , and to find a way to fix things we cannot allow the reputation of fifa to be dragged through the mud any longer it has to stop here and now mr blatter is widely expected to win a fifth term on friday in a vote only miles from the luxury hotel where wednesday s arrests took place in part because of fifa s electoral math the fifa president is elected by a onevotepercountry poll of its 209 member federations , making the many smaller countries who support mr blatter an effective counterweight to his unpopularity elsewhere , most notably in europe his speech in a zurich theater thursday came amid both criticism and support of his leadership from around the world in russia and brazil , top officials suggested the united states investigators had sought the arrests to increase american influence in soccer mr blatter has given countless speeches during his 17year career as fifa s president , but none quite like the one he delivered thursday the final product struck a mixed tone one part sadness , one part resolve , one part unyielding optimism , mr blatter s speech urged fifa and its members to do a better job policing themselves i will not allow the actions of a few to damage the reputation of fifa , he said mr blatter , who was not directly implicated in from the united states justice department \( which is seeking extradition of the executives detained on its request \) or a separate investigation announced by swiss authorities into the bidding for the 2018 and 2022 world cups , acknowledged that these were unprecedented and difficult times for fifa he noted , too , that he was aware many people hold him ultimately responsible for the actions and reputation of the global football community the next few months will not be easy for fifa , he added i'm sure more bad news may follow but it is necessary to begin to restore trust in our organization let this be the turning point it was difficult to tell how well mr blatter s message was received the crowd at the theater applauded politely both before and after the speech but there has been little indication that a sea change against him had occurred on the eve of the election mr blatter is expected to comfortably defeat his only challenger , , once the secretballot voting is conducted , to secure a fifth term mr blatter , who won the presidency in 1998 , was elected without opposition in his last two campaigns , but friday s vote will not be a similarly unanimous expression of support michel platini , the president of european soccer s governing body , called for mr blatter to step down during an emergency meeting of top officials convened early thursday and then enthusiastically endorsed prince ali after what happened recently , i think enough is enough , and a number of people think likewise , mr platini told reporters there is a radical change in the mindset of a number of heads of associations mr platini predicted prince ali would receive 45 or 46 of the 53 european votes , while campaign advisers for prince ali often have played up how much support he will receive outside europe sunil gulati , the head of us soccer and a member of fifa s governing executive committee , said on thursday that the americans supported prince ali but it remains unclear how many other countries from concacaf , the regional body for north america , central america and the caribbean , will vote against mr blatter the african , south american and asian confederations are largely seen as supporting mr blatter , who would need twothirds of the votes to win on the first ballot and a simple majority on any ensuing ballots while the soccer officials here prepared for their congress other issues under discussion friday include a controversial proposal from the football association calling for israel to be expelled from fifa the fallout from at a luxury hotel continued to ripple a former top fifa executive who was indicted , jack warner , late wednesday in his native trinidad , and in argentina a judge names in the indictments vladimir v putin , the president of russia , , accusing the department of justice of intervening outside its jurisdiction by pursuing the case against senior soccer officials , who , he noted , are not american citizens mr putin also said that he supported mr blatter s approach to running global soccer and added that the american investigation appeared to be a blatant attempt to stifle mr blatter s reelection in south america , the reactions were mixed in brazil , the host country of the 2014 world cup and the home of jos maria marin , the powerful soccer authority who was among the fifa figures arrested in zurich , some defenders of mr marin contended that the investigation was an effort by the united states to gain influence within fifa but in neighboring argentina , the satirical magazine barcelona captured the prevailing mood with an ironysoaked cover denouncing the american investigation as an example of yankee imperialism the magazine called the complaint an obvious assault on a briberyfueled and sovereign region on a commercial level , wednesday s arrests prompted some fifa partners to make statements regarding their relationships with the organization several sponsors , including adidas , cocacola and visa , called for fifa to change the way it operates visa vowed to if the body did not change its ways and on thursday another major world cup sponsor , hyundai motor , the south korean company said it was extremely concerned by the corruption charges south africa denied any wrongdoing on thursday after the american indictment unsealed wednesday suggested that a 10 million bribe had helped the country win the right to host the 2010 world cup federal prosecutors have accused mr warner of offering his support for south africa to the highest bidder , and then using much of the payout he received for personal use south africa s sports minister , fikile mbalula , was quoted by reuters as saying that the government had yet to receive an indictment from american prosecutors that included a link to south africans mr mbalula also said that the 2010 world cup funds had been accounted for and audited and that no such amount has been found , according to reuters according to the indictment , when fifa was considering which country should host the 2010 world cup , mr warner sent a relative to a paris hotel room to collect a briefcase filled with 10 , 000 stacks of cash from a committee official for the south african bid \( egyptian officials have recently asserted that fifa executives solicited a multimilliondollar bribe to secure the bid , and that egypt , perhaps alone among the bidders , refused to pay \) it is stories such as these that have led to a decaying public trust in fifa , with much of the vitriol from fans directed at mr blatter , who has been at fifa in various positions for 40 years although he has earned praise for expanding soccer s global reach and increasing its financial reserves , he has also been criticized for not working harder to create transparency in an organization that has a cash reserve of more than 1 billion in his speech , mr blatter did offer a small nod toward acknowledging fifa s shortcomings the week s events demand action and change from us all , he said but he did not put forth contrition instead , amid a backdrop of corruption and conflict , he chose to focus on a message of purity those who work in soccer , he said , do so not for greed , not for exploiting , not for power , but because of the love of the game
my daughter , a college freshman , is stressed but not about her coursework what s keeping her up at night is her summer plan specifically , landing the perfect unpaid internship she is worried that if she fails to earn a spot supplying free labor , she may have to resort to earning several thousand dollars as a camp counselor what qualifications and experiences do i have that would contribute to a government summer fellowship \? she texted me one night i refrained from sharing the first three responses that popped into my head 1 clearly none , if you need to ask me 2 a mother who you can always count on for help when you re stuck 3 oh , it s free labor ! isn t your willingness to bust your butt for nothing qualification enough \? apparently not summer internships are the new harvard prestigious , costly , insanely competitive and the presumed key to all future success according to the national association of colleges and employers , 61 percent of the class of 2014 participated in at least one internship or coop during college of those , 465 percent were unpaid \( united states labor law holds that forprofit companies are exempt from paying interns if the job meets certain criteria , including that it is similar to training which would be given in an educational environment \) everyone is applying for them ! my daughter said when i suggested that internship sounded like a fancy name for volunteering for a company that could actually afford to pay there s so much pressure it would be really weird to say , oh , hey , i ll just be working at camp again this summer why \? unpaid internships promise no less of a dead end a 2013 survey by the national association of colleges and employers found that while 63 percent of recent graduates who had had paid internships received at least one job offer , only 37 percent of those who had held unpaid internships fared the same not much better than the 35 percent of those who had never had any internship but scored jobs anyway even more telling , the median starting salary of former unpaid interns was lower \( 35 , 721 \) than that of noninterns \( 37 , 087 \) who no doubt learned patience , resourcefulness and superior negotiating skills during their summers as lifeguards or waitresses \( classmates who had had paid internships outearned both by far , starting at 51 , 930 \) it s the latest escalation in the arms race of growing up , where fear of being left behind compels otherwise rational people to buy into a culture of absurdity , like moon bounce birthday parties and stretchlimo rides to the prom the millennials have never had a good sense of their own worth , or genuine confidence in their ability to work things out how could they \? we overscheduled their every waking moment , and awarded them trophies when they lost we enrolled them in voice lessons , hockey clinics , sat prep , servicelearning trips whatever it took to construct the perfect college application everything about their lives has been carefully scripted to help them achieve the next goal why shouldn t they approach unpaid summer internships with the same calculated rigor \? much has been written about the exploitation of unpaid interns , and how such programs favor the already privileged , whose parents can afford to subsidize their free labor but the frenzied competition for such opportunities is also putting a big damper on the college experience itself it s not just that students are competing against their newfound friends and classmates for the same limited pool of uncompensated positions they re so focused on lining up their next victory that they re not fully embracing the present , and all the enlightenment , activism and latenight pizza that college life should entail i understand that families are keen to recoup their huge investment in their children s education , which can reach upward of 240 , 000 and i know it s a vastly different job market than the one i entered back in the 1980s , when it was possible \( even for an english major \) to stumble from one decent job to the next but our kids suffered enough to get into college can t they just enjoy it for a while without stressing about what s next \? why should they have to deliberate in february between a summer job that looks good on a r sum and one that allows them to pay for their books or clothing next year \? others are asking the same question the grassroots fair pay campaign , started in 2012 , is working to ban unpaid internships altogether , steering colleges away from promoting them new york university recently tightened its policies regarding unpaid internships , requiring that companies and organizations demonstrate compliance with united states labor department guidelines before posting on the school s job site columbia university last year joined some of its peer schools in halting the practice of granting course credit for unpaid internships one student in the journalism class i taught last term at middlebury college , which has resisted student demands to earn credit for summer internships , wrote a scathing oped about the bloodletting among her peers fighting for the same internships , which she refused to join i will test the chlorine levels , scream , walk , please ! at the children and fry in the lifeguard stand for the seventh year in a row before working for no money , she declared right on ! i wrote in the margin my own daughter sees the irony of her summer job quest , even while being caught up in it it seems totally unfair that i should be punished down the road for taking a job where i can make some money now , she said i ve got the perfect solution take the camp job , but instead of writing counselor on her r sum , she can describe herself as a pediatric recreation and hospitality intern and by the way , that s a paid position for another perspective , read dan fleshler s for more on parenting college students , look to

boston the blood has long since been scrubbed from the finish line the memorials have vanished , and the fund that raised money for victims has closed but the ordeal is not over boston is preparing now for its legal reckoning with dzhokhar tsarnaev , who stands accused of bombing the 2013 marathon and turning boston s premier athletic event into his trial will revive memories of how those bombs killed three people , blew the legs off 16 others and wounded 260 more unless some lastditch maneuvering by the defense succeeds , jury selection is to begin monday not since , has an act of terrorism wreaked such havoc on an american city the devastation , both physical and psychic , was pervasive in arguing that no jury here could be impartial , , mr tsarnaev s lawyer , has said that virtually everyone in the region is , in effect , an actual victim ms clarke is famous for cutting deals that keep her clients off death row at some point in the process , her clients including , the unabomber , the olympic park bomber and , who killed six people in an assassination attempt on former representative gabrielle giffords pleaded guilty in exchange for a sentence of life in prison , with no chance of parole but here she faces one of her toughest challenges yet trying to spare the life of a reviled defendant in a case that traumatized and enraged the nation , while federal prosecutors appear determined to put mr tsarnaev to death the nature of the conduct at issue and the resultant harm compel this decision , attorney general eric h holder jr , who personally opposes the death penalty , said last year when he authorized prosecutors to seek it for mr tsarnaev and carmen m ortiz , the united states attorney for massachusetts , said in that the death penalty was justified for mr tsarnaev for several reasons , including that he used a weapon of mass destruction and has shown no remorse as mr tsarnaev sits in near solitary confinement at the prison hospital at fort devens , an army base about 40 miles northwest of here , many say they dread seeing him in the limelight but they want the trial to serve a purpose i hope the trial will bring a resolution for people who still feel unsettled , abby miller , 22 , a baker , said on wednesday as she walked by the finish line on boylston street views vary widely as to what that resolution should be kristine biagiottibridges , 47 , of mendon , mass , who was pushing her daughter , kayla biagiotti , in a wheelchair across the finish line when the bombs exploded , says he deserves death seeing everything going on in boston with the trial and all the security around , the bomber going in there it brings back that anger towards the stupidity of a few people that have ruined so many lives , she said todd koen , 42 , of beverly , mass , a firefighter at the scene after the bombs went off , is just as infuriated at mr tsarnaev but thinks he should be sent to prison for the rest of his life if he gets the death penalty he gets off easy , mr koen said he does n't have to deal with it or live with it ms clarke , who is preparing a defense that casts her client as having been manipulated by his older brother , tamerlan , has made overtures to prosecutors about a plea bargain , according to a lawyer close to the case but so far she has been rebuffed , and her frustration showed in court papers that she filed dec 29 seeking to delay the trial if the government remains unwilling to relent in seeking death , and the case therefore must be tried , the defense is asking for nothing more than a trial that is fair , she wrote it will not be fair , she said , unless she has more time to prepare in a flurry of lastminute pleadings , ms clarke , who declined to be interviewed , also sought to have the trial moved out of boston but for now , it is scheduled to start here on monday federal death penalty trials are rare this would be the biggest since that of zacarias moussaoui , a sept 11 conspirator , in 2006 , and the trial of timothy j mcveigh , the oklahoma city bomber , in 1997 that such a trial would take place here is the source of some angst massachusetts has no death penalty and sentiment in this city is strongly against it a found 57 percent of bostonians favored life without parole for mr tsarnaev , while 33 percent favored death still there has been little outcry at mr holder s decision to authorize the death penalty in july , a globe of voters statewide found 62 percent supported it , while 29 percent were opposed the state s top politicians , including senator elizabeth warren , gov deval patrick , who is leaving office , and the boston mayor , martin j walsh , all democrats , oppose the death penalty but none spoke out against the decision mr tsarnaev has pleaded not guilty to 30 counts stemming from the on april 15 , 2013 , near the finish line on april 19 , after a that included the killing of an mit police officer and a frenzied manhunt , tamerlan tsarnaev , 26 , lay dead , having been shot by the police and run over by dzhokhar , who was escaping in a stolen sport utility vehicle dzhokhar was later captured in a boat in a suburban driveway to many , the evidence against him appears overwhelming prosecutors have said that surveillance images show him at the marathon placing his backpack near 8yearold , who was killed by the explosion when he was hiding in the boat , they said , mr tsarnaev , angry about the killing of muslims in iraq and afghanistan , scrawled incriminating messages \( stop killing our innocent people and we will stop \) , and while recovering in the hospital , they said , he to the bombings the court has summoned an initial pool of 1 , 200 potential jurors , all residents of eastern massachusetts and far more than for any other trial here in memory only those willing to impose the death penalty can be chosen the trial is expected to take three to five months if there is no plea agreement , the trial will proceed in two phases , with the same jury the first is to determine guilt or innocence if mr tsarnaev is found guilty , the second will determine whether he is sentenced to life or death the only interesting question in this trial is whether the most odious defendant who committed the most odious crime will get the death penalty , said michael kendall , a former federal prosecutor in boston nothing else will be seriously in dispute it is during the sentencing phase that ms clarke would make her case to spare mr tsarnaev s life typically , her strategy is to burrow deeply into her clients' backgrounds , down to details like their prenatal medical history , to humanize them and help a jury understand what led them to such horrific acts ms clarke is expected to portray mr tsarnaev , who was 19 at the time and had no prior criminal record , as having been manipulated by his older brother , who will be cast as an aggressive bully and the mastermind behind the bombings the case would then go to the jury for sentencing death sentences can be hard to obtain federal juries have imposed them only , and the jury must be unanimous and even though jurors must be open to imposing death , some find that they cannot actually do so this is why jury selection is so critical in capital cases and can take weeks both sides are likely to employ jury consultants and run mock jury selections for the defense , they do n't have much of a case to put on , so their best hope is to get someone on that jury who will be a holdout , said jeremy m sternberg , a former boston prosecutor with extensive jury trial experience they 're looking for people who are antiauthoritarian , who are not afraid to go against the grain even if the jury imposes the death penalty , the appeals process can go on for years of the nearly 500 federal death penalty defendants since 1988 , only three have been executed defense lawyers not affiliated with the case say that a plea deal for a life sentence could yield the same outcome as a trial , without the time and expense moreover , they say , it would spare everyone from reliving traumatic events , and the defendant could not appeal , meaning he would not keep cropping up in the news it makes all kinds of sense that they avoid a trial , and not just because of the very high probability that he will be found guilty , said eric m freedman , a death penalty specialist at hofstra university law school the families get to say their piece and he does not get to become a martyr but mr kendall , the former prosecutor , predicted the government would not agree to a plea giving up the death penalty in this case would be a very charged political issue because of the horrific impact on the victims and the community , he said there would be a lot of criticism from a prosecutor s perspective , the safer course is to seek the death penalty
they have called senator elizabeth warren an extremely attractive candidate in the 2016 presidential campaign they have said that she is the hottest commodity in the democratic party and that she has demonstrated the passion and intensity that hillary rodham clinton lacks those glowing compliments are not from the liberal activists who are trying to persuade ms warren to challenge mrs clinton , who is expected to be the party s leading contender in 2016 they come from conservatives who are eager to drum up a contentious democratic primary and who see ms warren , a firstterm senator from massachusetts , as best positioned to weaken , and potentially defeat , mrs clinton on cable television and in private strategy sessions , conservatives are steadily stoking the flames of a movement to recruit ms warren , who has said she will not run but whose antiwall street economic message resonates with the liberal base of the democratic party please give us elizabeth warren please , god , let us have elizabeth warren , said mike huckabee , the former governor of arkansas , who is considering a presidential bid i respect her because she has the courage to speak her convictions , mr huckabee said on fox news former representative michele bachmann , a tea party republican from minnesota , told cnn that ms warren would be an extremely attractive candidate mrs bachmann also said that if she were mrs clinton , she would be extremely concerned the tactic says much about the 2016 landscape for republicans a crowded field of people who say they are considering running for president including senator rand paul of kentucky , former gov jeb bush of florida , senator ted cruz of texas and the 2012 presidential nominee , mitt romney has emerged that means the party is expecting a bruising ideological battle for the nomination mrs clinton , a former secretary of state and 2008 presidential candidate , could emerge from the primary season relatively unscathed other democrats including senator jim webb of virginia , former gov martin o'malley of maryland and senator bernard sanders , independent of vermont may also run , but at this early stage , none are expected to have the funding or political apparatus to pose a serious threat to mrs clinton an easy path to the nomination could allow mrs clinton to enter a general election with more funding than the republican nominee , who would have had to spend heavily to beat a wide field of competitors ms warren represents republicans' best hope for an expensive , prolonged battle for the democratic nomination , weakening mrs clinton along the way , political operatives on both sides say that desire appears to trump the fact that ms warren s views about taxation , regulation and the role of government are so at odds with republican tenets there is nobody in this country who got rich on his own , she famously said in 2011 ms warren told this month that she would not run to succeed president obama , but that has not stopped speculation elizabeth warren says , i'm not running i do n't want to be president , ' the radio host rush limbaugh said recently translation i ca n't wait and i am running but i'm just not going to admit it right now' republicans said ms warren would deliver a perfect trifecta in diminishing mrs clinton she attracts young , liberal supporters who view mrs clinton as too centrist a warren candidacy would take away a central theme expected of mrs clinton s campaign that it is time to elect a female president and ms warren s presence in the primary season could push mrs clinton to adopt liberal positions that might turn off independents in a general election it first became apparent that ms warren could be an effective tool in moving mrs clinton off message when the two appeared at a joint rally in october for martha coakley , the democratic nominee for governor of massachusetts in her speech , mrs clinton tried to channel some of ms warren s populist zeal but flubbed a variation of the senator s controversial line about the roots of success do n't let anybody tell you that , you know , it s corporations and businesses that create jobs , mrs clinton said she later said she had misspoken and was referring to certain tax policies that stifle job creation , but republicans had already pounced , portraying the comment as evidence that mrs clinton was pandering to liberal voters you could just see it gets in secretary clinton s head when she has to compare herself vis vis senator warren , said tim miller , the executive director of america rising , a conservative super pac he added , from that perspective , a food fight could be good r emmett tyrrell jr , the editor in chief of the american spectator and a longtime critic of mrs clinton and her husband , former president bill clinton , said her comment in massachusetts could help inform younger voters that she shifted opinions based on what was popular she pulled a line from obama and elizabeth warren to try to make a very au courant cronycapitalist or socialist statement , mr tyrrell said at the same time , a groundswell of support for ms warren among liberal activists has aided republicans' behindthescenes efforts in december , the liberal group moveonorg said it would spend 1 million on a campaign to draft ms warren into the 2016 race moveonorg and democracy for america jointly run a website called which has signed up more than 245 , 000 supporters the groups plan to host run warren run house parties this weekend in 100 locations across the country liberals cheered ms warren this month after antonio weiss , a wall street banker whom mr obama had picked as a treasury department official , eliciting vehement objections from ms warren , asked mr obama to  ms warren is still largely unknown even in iowa , where the draftwarren movement has focused its efforts of likely democratic caucus goers conducted in early october by the des moines register and bloomberg politics , 44 percent said they had a favorable opinion of ms warren , compared with 76 percent for mrs clinton while many republicans are engaging in mischief as they promote ms warren , some of her populist positions resonate across the political aisle during debates over the wall street bailout , ms warren and representative darrell issa , republican of california , often agreed on objections to parts of the troubled asset relief program and in their criticism of former treasury secretary timothy f geithner it was almost like the enemy of my enemy is my friend , kurt bardella , a former spokesman for mr issa , said the tendency for republicans to align with ms warren is particularly strong among those who emphasize libertarianism brian darling , a senior aide to mr paul , said he would like to see a 2016 general election between ms warren and the kentucky senator to hear the fresh ideas that the matchup might yield she hates wall street for a very different reason than libertarians , mr darling said yet they both would agree that the bailouts of wall street were a gaming of the system tucker carlson , a libertarian political pundit , said ms warren had an authenticity that resonated with both sides she has this spark of genuine ideological fervor , and i mean that as a compliment , he said it s not just pure opportunism ms warren , of course , has given the anticlinton movement plenty of fodder she frequently says that income inequality is due , in part , to the economic and trade policies of her husband in her 2003 book , the twoincome trap , written with her daughter , amelia warren tyagi , ms warren accused mrs clinton of snapping at her staff and of shifting her position on bankruptcy legislation when mrs clinton became a new york senator in order to appease her wall street donors as new york s newest senator , however , it seems that hillary clinton could not afford such a principled position , ms warren wrote republicans could not have said it better themselves
philadelphia when was hired as the ' manager in 2010 , the situation he inherited was not exactly viewed as desirable almost five years later , there is a different aura surrounding the mets , who are guaranteed to enter september in first place after a 94 win wednesday night against the the victory , combined with a loss by the washington nationals , gave the mets a sixandahalfgame lead in the national league east during their current sixgame winning streak , they have scored 64 runs soon after collins took over , he changed some rules to lighten the disposition surrounding a team that was not performing well on the field one of the things we tried to do here was make it fun to be here , collins said therefore , we 've tried to create an atmosphere in the clubhouse that s fun the culture shift was evident early in the afternoon several mets , led by juan uribe , were singing along to pop songs by the backstreet boys , the popular boy band from the late 1990s the mood was the epitome of relaxed while the mets were keeping things light , local television and radio broadcasts in philadelphia were full of speculation about retaliation after tensions flared during the mets' win on tuesday , when hansel robles threw a pitch before a phillies batter was ready but the events from the night before were far from the thoughts of the mets' players we talked with hansel today you ca n't react like he did , collins said , referring to robles s staring toward the phillies' dugout after an inningending strikeout the other guys , they have n't even brought it up today with clear minds , the mets emerged to score three runs in the first inning off the phillies' jerad eickhoff , a rookie the damage began with an innocuous fly ball off the bat of curtis granderson that was dropped by center fielder odubel herrera granderson later scored , along with yoenis cespedes and michael cuddyer eickhoff , who threw six scoreless innings in his first career start last friday against miami , escaped further damage by getting the last two outs with the bases loaded started for the mets , and he rebounded from an awful outing friday at colorado , when he did not make it out of the fourth inning after giving up seven runs and nine hits he also delivered muchneeded length for a bullpen that had been heavily used in the mets' recent slugfests on wednesday , colon threw seven scoreless innings to improve to 1111 he did not allow a phillies runner beyond second base and struck out eight , including the side in the seventh this game was about bartolo colon , collins said we said he s got to give us six innings , and he gave us more than that i salute him he did a great job after a shaky first inning , where colon gave up three hits but left undamaged thanks to a double play that he helped start , the pitching coach dan warthen implored the 42yearold colon to rely on his changeup and breaking pitches colon said after the game through an interpreter that it felt as if he threw more changeups in wednesday s game than in any other over his 18year career , but the strategy was successful eickhoff also recovered admirably , retiring 16 consecutive batters after struggling in the first michael conforto finally reached base on a twoout double in the sixth , and uribe drove him home on a single up the middle cuddyer piled on two more runs in the eighth when he blasted his 10th home run of the season , scoring daniel murphy it was the mets' 40th homer in august , which tied a team record for the most in a month , equaling their output from june 2006 the mets were ahead by 60 going into the bottom of the eighth , but their bullpen let the phillies get back into the game it surrendered four runs , and the phillies brought the goahead run to the plate with two outs , but tyler clippard struck out darnell sweeney to end the inning the mets added three runs in the ninth , giving clippard a comfortable lead and returning to their jovial mood minutes after the game , loud cheers could be heard from inside the mets' clubhouse the noise seeped through the thick concrete walls in the underbelly of citizens bank park colon provided some insight for the cause for celebration it s very important for me personally , but more for the team and the city , he said of the team s recent success we want to take this team all the way to the end and see how far we can go inside pitch steven matz threw 56 pitches in a rehab start for class aa binghamton , striking out six , walking none and allowing one hit over six scoreless innings
seoul , south korea when the north korean carpenter was offered a job in kuwait in 1996 , he leapt at the chance he was promised 120 a month , an unimaginable wage for most workers in his faminestricken country , where most people are not allowed to travel abroad but for rim il , the deal soured from the start under a moonlit night , the bus carrying him and a score of other fresh arrivals pulled into a desert camp cordoned off with barbedwire fences there , 1 , 800 workers , sent by to earn badly needed foreign currency , were living together under the watchful eyes of north korean government supervisors , mr rim said they worked from 7 am to 7 pm or , often , midnight , seven days a week , doing menial jobs at construction sites we only took a friday afternoon off twice a month but had to spend the time studying books or watching videos about the greatness of our leader back home , mr rim said at a recent news conference in seoul , the south korean capital we were never paid our wages , and when we asked our superiors about them , they said we should think of starving people back home and thank the leader for giving us this opportunity of eating three meals a day tens of thousands of north koreans work long hours for little or no pay , toiling in chinese factories or russian logging camps , digging military tunnels in myanmar , building monuments for african dictators , sweating at construction sites in the middle east or aboard fishing boats off fiji , according to former workers and human rights researchers for decades , has been accused of sending workers abroad and of confiscating most of their wages but in the years since took over as leader , human rights researchers say , the program has expanded rapidly as international sanctions have squeezed the country s other sources of foreign currency , like illicit trading in missile parts a 2012 by the , a group in seoul that works with north korean defectors , and the private korea policy research center estimated that 60 , 000 to 65 , 000 north koreans were working in more than 40 countries , providing the state with 150 million to 230 million a year that number has since grown to 100 , 000 , human rights researchers said north korea is exploiting their labor and salaries to fatten the private coffers of , said ahn myeongchul , head of nk watch , a human rights group in seoul we suspect that kim is using some of the money to buy luxury goods for his elite followers and finance the recent building boom in pyongyang that he has launched to show off his leadership in a published late last year , the seoulbased asan institute for policy studies said that the revenue from overseas workers helped the north korean government bypass international sanctions , which have been tightened in recent years earnings are not sent back as remittances , but appropriated by the state and transferred back to the country in the form of bulk cash , it said , noting that sanctions ban the transfer of bulk cash to the pyongyang government returning workers also act as mules to carry hard currency earnings back to north korea nk watch has collected the testimony of 13 former north korean workers now living in south korea , in support of a petition to the united nations asking for an investigation into what it calls statesponsored slavery the petition , to be filed next month to the united nations' special rapporteur on contemporary slavery , said the migrants worked a minimum of 12 hours a day , were given a few days off a year , and commonly received only 10 percent of their promised pay , or none at all nk watch said that there had never been an official investigation into the practice and that it was appealing to the united nations in hopes of building on the work of last year that documented widespread human rights abuses inside north korea that report led to that the security council refer north korea to the international criminal court north korea has as false and part of an americansponsored effort to overthrow its government the workers interviewed by nk watch said they were victims of a chain of exploitation and deception they described a system where government minders monitored their movements and communications and required them to spy on one another the minders often confiscated the workers' passports these workers face threats of government reprisals against them or their relatives in north korea if they attempt to escape or complain to outside parties , the state department said in published last year workers' salaries are deposited into accounts controlled by the north korean government , which keeps most of the money , claiming various voluntary' contributions to government endeavors the workers' party , the ruling party in north korea , instructed a group in kuwait to send home 500 , 000 a month , more than its members' regular salaries combined , a north korean supervisor who worked there from 2011 to last year told nk watch former workers in kuwait and elsewhere said they were forced to work even longer hours and seek odd jobs in the local community , splitting the earnings with government minders who demanded bribes in return for allowing them such opportunities one worker told nk watch that he received only 160 in the three years he worked in a siberian logging camp in the 1990s , toiling up to 21 hours a day in temperatures often colder than minus 20 degrees fahrenheit he was told the rest of his wages were sent home to his family but families were given only coupons for stateowned stores , where there was often nothing to buy , former workers said still , in north korea , the opportunity to work overseas was considered such a privilege that the jobs had to be bought with bribes former workers said their biggest fear was when supervisors threatened to send them home when they failed to meet exorbitant production targets or offer bribes and compared with many of their compatriots at home , they were well fed once , we were eating our bowls of rice , and one guy broke into tears thinking of his starving children back home , and we all wept together , said a north korean defector who worked in a russian logging camp from 2000 to 2001 he gave only his last name , kim , for fear of reprisal against relatives who are still in the north mr kim said he earned 530 a day during the winter logging season he later learned that chinese and russian workers were earning 30 a day for doing much less kim yoontae , a researcher on north korean human rights , said that the international community could pressure countries that use north korean labor to honor basic international standards for labor protection , including an end to the practice of giving workers' salaries to the government mr rim said he was paid in cash only once during the five months he worked in kuwait before he escaped into the south korean embassy there in 1997 to celebrate the birthday of kim jongil , kim jongun s father and predecessor , supervisors gave each worker about 65 to buy cigarettes our life was nothing but slavery , mr rim said

the label inside the violin said stradivarius , but plenty of fakes claim that , too so after a california woman asked phillip injeian , a violinmaker and dealer , to appraise the instrument , he met her at a manhattan hotel in late june and examined every inch of it , from its nicks to the somewhat pointy curve of its fholes to its distinctive wood grain , before delivering his verdict i told her , i have good news and bad news , ' mr injeian said in an interview thursday i said the good news is that it s a stradivarius the bad news is that it s a stolen stradivarius and this is one that has been gone for 35 years' the stradivarius which was made in 1734 by antonio stradivari and is known as the ames stradivarius disappeared after it was stolen in 1980 from the violin virtuoso so as soon as mr injeian recognized it , he called in law enforcement officials , setting off a train of events that ended on thursday afternoon with the return of the longlost violin to mr totenberg s three daughters amy , jill and nina totenberg the mystery was solved , , the legal affairs correspondent for npr news , said at a news conference at the united states attorney s office in manhattan , where the violin was returned to her family she said it appeared that her father , who had long harbored suspicions about who had stolen his violin , had been right all along the violin was from mr totenberg s office at the longy school of music in cambridge , mass , where he was then the director mr totenberg , a teacher and virtuoso who performed as a soloist with major orchestras and worked with igor stravinsky , aaron copland , leopold stokowski and arthur rubinstein , at age 101 his violin was valued at 250 , 000 when it was stolen these days , the finest often sell for millions of dollars the violin did not surface again until june 26 , when a california woman , identified in court papers as thanh tran , brought it to new york to have it appraised by mr injeian at a meeting at the ace hotel in manhattan according to mr injeian , ms tran said that her exhusband gave it to her before dying in 2011 but it was in a locked case , so she put it aside for several years before she and a boyfriend broke the case open nina totenberg said that the man who had left ms tran the violin , philip s johnson , whom she described as an aspiring violinist , had long been suspected of stealing it he was seen loitering around the place where it was taken , and later his exgirlfriend would tell my father that she was quite sure that he had taken it , ms totenberg said at the news conference that , however , was not enough for a search warrant , and my mother was so frustrated that she would famously ask her friends if anyone knew someone in the mob who would break into johnson s apartment and do a search for the violin that led preet bharara , the united states attorney for the southern district of new york , to weigh in just one point of practice , he said , looking around at the assembled prosecutors , fbi agents and new york police department officials if you do lose something , and it goes missing , and you do n't know how to get it back , do n't actually call the mob a stipulation and court order that was signed this week , paving the way for the return of the violin to the totenberg family , said that ms tran had voluntarily relinquished the violin to the federal bureau of investigation after learning that it might be stolen she represents that she received the ames stradivarius from her former spouse prior to his death , and that she did not have knowledge that it had been stolen , the papers said ms tran did not return several calls seeking comment law enforcement officials said they had no evidence she knew the violin had been stolen little was immediately known about mr johnson he was not named in the court papers , but several law enforcement officials confirmed that he was the woman s exhusband , and had been a longtime suspect one law enforcement official said the fbi case file and subsequent leads shed no light on a motive an official at boston university said that a philip johnson with the same birth date had attended boston university s school for the arts from 1976 through 1979 mr totenberg was on the faculty during part of that period detective michael o gildea of the new york police department , who worked on the case with christopher mckeogh , an agent with the fbi s art crime team , said that it was strange that the violin had apparently been locked away for so many years , only to surface now it was very odd to me that someone would risk so much , and yet did so little with it , he said stolen stradivarius violins , like famous purloined paintings , are hard to sell because they are so recognizable ms totenberg said she was sad that her father was not alive to see his instrument restored the bond between musicians and instruments is a powerful one after the theft , mr totenberg , who had owned the violin for 38 years , told cbs news in 1981 that it had taken two decades of playing the instrument before it reached its potential it took some time to wake it up , he said , to work it out , find all the things that it needed , the right kind of strings and so on and so on but she said that he would have been furious if he 'd known that the person that he 'd thought took it had in fact taken it , and all these years had it hidden away , not maintaining it the way one should , not caring for it as a special baby , not having it played ms totenberg said that the family had now paid back the insurance money that mr totenberg collected after the violin was stolen , and that it planned to have the ames stradivarius restored and sold but to a musician who will play it , not a collector who will lock it away none of us play the violin , and we know that stradivarius owners are really just guardians of these great , great instruments , she said they are meant to be played by great artists and so the ames strad now perhaps known as the amestotenberg strad will eventually be in the hands of another great artist , like my father , and the beautiful , brilliant and throaty voice of that violin , long stilled , will once again thrill audiences in concert halls around the world
imagine a musical version of the orcs , tolkien s enslaved former elves , made to serve the cult of an allpowerful moving image under the baton of a brainwashed wizard it s true that none of the 250 fine musicians who provided the live musical accompaniment for a screening of the fellowship of the ring , the first installment of peter jackson s lord of the rings film series at the lincoln center s koch theater on tuesday had fangs or were engaged in the murderous pursuit of hobbits but far from celebrating the artistry that goes into film music , this marathon lord of the rings in concert only underlines the abnegation of artistic privilege that genre requires the films \( the complete trilogy is again presented over this weekend \) are shown to live musical accompaniment by the as well as members of the led by the swiss conductor ludwig wicki this worldwide tour of is buoyed by the cultish veneration mr jackson s films have sparked it s also billed as a celebration of s seething score , which won oscars , for the first and third films of the trilogy but in performance the interdependence of sound and image becomes painfully obvious the film s moments of innocent levity would not be nearly as bucolic , its battles between good and evil not half as scary , without the music and mr shore s pastiche a bit of bruckner , a bit of grainger , and glass to weave them together cannot stand on its own , either it was both impressive and sobering to watch the skill with which mr wicki synchronized the music of this vast score to the movie on a small screen in front of him a moving vertical line indicated the approach of a scene break and it was that digital mind which ultimately held the controls night after night on this juggernaut tour , orchestral soloists measure out their lines in milliseconds with none of the freedom to let a phrase breathe that is the mark and magic of a concert performance the sound was powerful but not always entirely acoustic it s understandable that certain solo instruments , like a celtic flute that plays one of the principal themes , required some help to assert themselves against the orchestra and the film s spoken dialogue but at times of heightened tension , it felt as if the overall sound was being cranked up aggressively my 9yearold son sat through much of the film with a finger thrust in each ear
jerusalem robert turner is recognized everywhere in the , jokingly called its governor to most people there , he is known simply as mr bob he departs on thursday after serving as gaza director of the united nations relief and works agency for three years or , put another way , through two wars between and hamas , the militant group that controls the coastal enclave mr turner said there was less hope and far more poverty and unemployment in the gaza strip now than when he arrived , yet amid the glacial pace of reconstruction and fierce infighting , mr turner saw a sliver of opportunity there s a very real shift in israel , he said in an interview , citing postwar moves allowing some gaza exports to the and israel , and more travel permits for businessmen when i talked to them about those changes before the war , i was told they were impossible the changes are , to date , practically inconsequential they 're not creating enough jobs but the change from impossible to possible is important mr turner s agency , known as unrwa , is the de facto government for the 13 million of the strip s 18 million palestinians classified as refugees its 13 , 000 employees run 240 schools and 21 health clinics \( each doctor sees an average of 100 patients a day \) , pick up garbage in eight refugee camps , provide to 848 , 000 people and oversee a 200 million construction program during last summer s war , 91 of its schools sheltered 292 , 000 displaced residents the last finally left midjune none of the 9 , 000 destroyed refugee homes have been rebuilt , but the relief agency has distributed 100 million for repairs and rental subsidies now it faces a 101 million shortfall in its 680 million budget if we ca n't open our schools in september , i think the reaction of our population will be pretty severe , mr turner said we 're really the last institution standing we 're the last thing the population trusts mr turner , 51 , has spent a quarter century as a humanitarian firefighter , in the balkans and africa , in afghanistan , haiti , iraq , indonesia and kuwait he is returning to his native british columbia for a senior ministerial post dealing with forestry and archaeology he was one of the few foreigners living in the gaza strip he generally joined his wife and two children in jerusalem every other weekend \( disclosure his son was in my twins' class \) last summer he slept on a cot in his office rather than the 10thfloor apartment whose tiny terrace overlooks gaza s port this is my refuge , he said it s beautiful up there i read or watch a show or smoke a cigar the lowest moment of his tenure came on july 24 , 2014 , when 16 people were killed at a schoolturnedshelter in beit hanoun , a city in the northeast of the strip mr turner raced to the scene , where he was pelted with water bottles we were attacked we had to get back in the car , he recalled i 've never seen rage like that it was just this deep anger , it was like hatred , and we were the target , because we were the only ones there if mr turner had a magic wand to make a single change in gaza , the simple answer would be lift the blockade , he said but the problem is not just israel , he added , citing hamas , the palestinian authority , egypt , iran , saudi arabia and a multiplicity of international actors as contributing to the dysfunction you get this stew , he said i'm not sure what all the ingredients are , i do n't know who the cooks are , and i'm not sure how it s going to taste at the end the situation is both more complicated and simpler than people make out , he added propalestinian and proisrael is a false dichotomy there s not going to be , in the long term , a democratic israeli state for jewish people in the absence of a palestinian state , and likewise there s not going to be in the long term a peaceful palestinian state in the absence of israel this idea that you have to be for one and against the other is absurd
on one of the last occasions an egyptian president visited addis ababa , he got no further than the road from the airport in 1995 the motorcade of president hosni mubarak from egyptian jihadists mr mubarak was saved by , his driver s skill and ethiopian sharpshooters after that , ethiopian and egyptian intelligence officers worked together to root out terrorists in the horn of africa , contributing , along with pressure from the united states government , to osama bin laden s expulsion from sudan in 1996 but that was the limit of their cooperation egypt and ethiopia have otherwise been locked in a lowintensity contest over which nation would dominate the region , undermining each other s interests in eritrea , somalia and south sudan a quiet but longsustained rivalry , it is one of those rarely noticed but important fault lines in international relations that allow other conflicts to rumble on this week , however , president abdel fattah elsisi of egypt is expected to fly to addis ababa , the capital of ethiopia , to attend he will also meet with prime minister hailemariam desalegn of ethiopia , a rare chance to shift the political landscape in northeastern africa the heart of the rivalry hinges on how to share the precious waters of the nile river running low is egypt s nightmare , and more than 80 percent of the nile s water comes from rain that falls on the ethiopian highlands and is then carried north by the fastflowing blue nile \( ethiopia is nicknamed africa s water tower \) yet management of the nile is formally governed by a 1929 treaty between egypt and colonial britain , and a 1959 treaty between egypt and sudan that awarded most water rights to egypt , some to sudan and none explicitly to ethiopia or the other states upstream this arrangement is widely considered unfair , especially to ethiopia , which was never colonized , and on whose behalf britain could not even claim to have spoken this legal framework also limits the right of upper riparian states to build dams or irrigation systems even though they were sidelined from helping shape it egypt has a history of blocking ethiopia s requests for international aid to build dams , at times even threatening military action if it attempted to go ahead following the 1978 camp david accords with israel , president anwar sadat declared , to this day , egyptian engineers are stationed as far as lake victoria , in uganda , monitoring activities along the river ethiopia has continued to reject egypt s approach , not least because it is one of the poorest countries in the world and considers economic development to be essential to its survival in 1999 ethiopia , along with eight other states , set up the nile basin initiative to develop a cooperative and equitable partnership to manage the river s resources \( egypt and sudan are nominal members but inactive south sudan joined in 2012 \) so far most concrete actions taken have been about combating erosion along the nile s watersheds and encouraging sustainable management of lakes and subsidiary bodies of water prime minister meles zenawi , who was in power from 1991 until his death in 2012 , also commissioned several huge dam projects the largest of these is the on the blue nile , a point of national pride whose construction has been financed through the issuance of special bonds the plan has not gone down well with egypt during a meeting chaired by president mohamed morsi in june 2013 captured on television cameras , apparently without the participants' knowledge egyptian politicians proposed sabotaging the dam project \( last april unidentified gunmen attacked a bus near the site of the dam , killing nine people \) but mr sisi knows that ethiopia will not change course he also realizes that the dam s threat to egypt is more symbolic than material \( his predecessors , including mr morsi , knew that as well , but seemed more interested in entertaining antiethiopian sentiment among egyptians \) the grand ethiopian renaissance dam is being built a few miles from ethiopia s border with sudan , in rocky terrain unsuitable for irrigation the dam will generate electricity , meaning that ethiopia , like egypt , wants the water to flow through rather than be stopped moreover , the dam is set in a gorge at high altitude it will store large amounts of water with less surface area in a cooler climate than , say , lake nasser in egypt , reducing evaporation and saving water , which should also benefit egypt given these common interests , egypt should cooperate with ethiopia to manage the nile s waters mr sisi made a strong start on this front last year , when the two countries set up a to examine all aspects of the grand ethiopian renaissance dam it is now time for egypt to join the nile basin initiative s cooperative framework agreement , which was signed in 2010 to promote integrated management , sustainable development , and harmonious utilization of the nile and to protect it for the benefit of present and future generations better relations with ethiopia could also be egypt s ticket to mending its difficult relations with other governments in subsaharan africa two days after the egyptian military ousted mr morsi in july 2013 , while gulf states rushed to assist the new government , the african union suspended egypt s membership on grounds that the coup violated its principles \( egypt has since been reinstated \) and there is little sympathy on the continent for cairo s position on the nile issue , since it appears to be blocking ethiopia s development under colonialera treaties widely seen as exploitative mr sisi should take advantage of his coming visit to addis ababa to finally make progress on joint management of the nile that could open the way for egypt and ethiopia to find common ground on thornier issues , such as how to handle internal conflicts in somalia and south sudan and that , in turn , could be a step toward greater stability in the region
the lego group , the danish maker of the iconic plastic bricks , found itself at the center of a maelstrom of criticism over the weekend after the chinese artist and dissident ai weiwei said that the company had rejected a bulk order that had been placed for two of his new art installations news of the rejected order emerged when mr ai published a series of instagram posts in which he quoted from an email the lego group sent in september to the curatorial team at national gallery of victoria in melbourne , australia , where the installations were to be exhibited we regret to inform you that it is against our corporate policy to indicate our approval of any unaffiliated activities outside the lego licensing program , mr ai quoted the company as saying as word spread on social media , so did offers of lego donations from mr ai s admirers as of wednesday , mr ai had set up several collection points outside his studio in beijing , at martingropiusbau in berlin and at the national gallery of victoria in melbourne on tuesday , the artist issued a call via instagram for bmw cars to serve as dropoff containers and as perhaps an additional jab to lego , he said by telephone on monday that his team is looking into the possibility of buying copycat lego pieces made by chinese companies the national gallery of victoria has decided to become the first collection point in australia for https tco omzfkgpsys  ai weiwei \( aiww \) 27 oct 15 in an emailed response to questions , roar rude trangbaek , a spokesman for the lego group , reiterated the company s policy , which was also outlined in the letter mr ai quoted on instagram generally speaking , as a company dedicated to delivering great creative play experiences to children , mr trangbaek wrote , we refrain on a global level from actively engaging in or endorsing the use of lego bricks in projects or contexts of a political agenda he continued , this principle is not new nor isolated to specific regions or projects mr ai , speaking by telephone from berlin , where he is a guest lecturer at the university of the arts , criticized lego s policy as an example of censorship and discrimination i was quite surprised when i found out , he said a company that sells pens cannot tell a writer that he or she can t do political writing or romantic writing it s really none of their business this is a product that is loved and treasured by children , mr ai said , noting that his son collected lego bricks but the kind of values that this company represents is really questionable lego not wanting its bricks to be used to make a political message refusing to sell ai weiwei your bricks is itself a political message  jonathan haynes \( jonathanhaynes \) 24 oct 15 according to mr ai , the rejected order was for several million lego bricks that would have been used to create two works for an exhibition titled andy warhol ai weiwei , scheduled to open on dec 11 at the national gallery of victoria mr ai said that for one of the works , he planned to use the legos for a reimagining of his 1995 photo triptych titled dropping a han dynasty urn in the second , tentatively called lego room , the artist said he intended to create mosaic portraits of 20 australian advocates for human rights , and information and internet freedom they include prominent rights lawyers like michael kirby and geoffrey robertson , as well as divisive figures like the wikileaks founder julian assange do make history don t do anything political got that \?

washington far from quelling dissent in the republican ranks , the resignation of speaker is intensifying the divide that has emboldened hardright lawmakers and insurgent presidential candidates , leaving a party that prides itself on orderly process in uncharacteristic disarray the top three candidates in the republican race at the moment have one thing in common they have never held elective office dozens of members of the house of representatives have held their seats only since the 2010 election , and many of them ran on a platform to force a drastic reduction in the role of government a new class of billionaire donors , who can contribute unlimited amounts of money to support a candidate , has undercut the power and relevance of the national party while the split will play out soonest in congress , where mr boehner s resignation may make it easier to push through a temporary funding measure to keep the government open , the deepening internal republican rancor will complicate virtually everything on lawmakers' agenda , and most likely dominate a critical phase of the presidential race just ahead of the first caucus and primary votes there are signs of more mainstream conservatives pushing back , saying the tactics demonstrated by hardliners have accomplished nothing except the early departure of mr boehner the people who keep saying that they want things to happen , what have they accomplished \? gov john r kasich of ohio , a republican presidential candidate , asked sunday on cbs s maybe they ought to look in the mirror what have they accomplished \? i mean , are they just speechmakers \? are they just people out there yelling and screaming \? others warned against a rightward march , but that is the direction of the moment an released sunday found that a combined 52 percent of republican primary voters supported donald j trump , ben carson or carly fiorina , none of whom has ever been elected to office this antiwashington fervor has prompted the republican candidates to go to great lengths to portray themselves as change agents primed to topple the party establishment when senator marco rubio of florida , one of the candidates , announced friday at a social conservative conference that mr boehner had resigned , the audience responded with a booming ovation even more notable was that mr rubio , who has spent most of his adult life in politics , sought to align himself with those who forced out the speaker the time has come to turn the page and allow a new generation of leadership , , excoriating the political class mr boehner was leading a house in which republicans had their largest majority since herbert hoover was president yet even as he tried to appease members with repeated votes to repeal the affordable care act or to defund planned parenthood , more absolutist conservatives were not satisfied the hardline group has not put forward a viable candidate for speaker and , with only 50 or so members , does not have enough to elevate one of its own while that leaves mr boehner s no 2 , kevin mccarthy of california , the majority leader , well positioned to succeed him , it was clear that the speaker s critics viewed his departure not as a moment to reunify the party but to push harder against the establishment their ranks include regulars on sunday talk shows , like representative mick mulvaney of south carolina , and those with decidedly lower profiles , like representative jody hice , a freshman member from georgia we told people , give us the senate and things would be different , ' mr mulvaney , who has clashed repeatedly with mr boehner , said in an interview on we told them back in 2010 , give us the house and things will be different' things are not that different the hardliners seem poised to attack a likely deal this week between mr boehner and democrats to avoid a government shutdown as yet another example of collusion between establishment republican leaders and the obama white house and the legislative stakes will become greater congress will most likely have to vote this fall on whether to raise the federal as well as deal with the imminent expiration of many highway programs , a continuing debate over reauthorizing the and the need for a longerterm spending bill with an expected deadline of dec 11 standing in the speaker s lobby just off the house floor , representative bill pascrell jr , democrat of new jersey , predicted that mr boehner s departure would make things harder rather than easier november and december are going to be like dante s inferno' around here , he said how the fight in congress plays out will also help define the struggle for the party s national identity as just one measure the ranks of its moderates have shrunk to just a few members even as conservatives rage against not having 60 votes in the senate to overcome democratic , or the twothirds majority needed to override a presidential veto , their fiery language is almost certain to diminish the party s chances of expanding its majorities that would require winning seats in swing states and districts , where voters often prefer more centrist views a lurch to the right is suicidal , said gregory slayton , a republican fundraiser who backed gov scott walker of wisconsin in the presidential race before he dropped out a week ago one republican who has stoked the revolt in the house , senator ted cruz of texas , has vexed senate republican leaders and increasingly found himself isolated on policy debates as he has been in , this time over planned parenthood but he is getting support for his presidential bid from the party s more conservative quarters something needs to change the writing is on the wall , said michael needham , who heads , a conservative advocacy group that has sharply criticized the party leadership are we going to be the party of the donor class or the party of free enterprise and conservative values \? representative bill flores of texas , head of the , said the hardliners often seemed bent on destruction if you look at what s happened the last few weeks , you have had people trying to burn the house down , he said one of the first tests of where republicans are headed will come in the race to succeed mr boehner though mr mccarthy is the favorite , many in his party say they do not simply want a reprise of mr boehner s leadership there are also contests for the other top positions , and the fiercest fight is expected to be for majority leader among the main contenders are steve scalise of louisiana , currently no 3 in the leadership the conference chairwoman , cathy mcmorris rodgers of washington and the budget committee chairman , tom price of georgia conservatives are demanding that one of their own be represented , and it is not clear that ms mcmorris rodgers or mr price would satisfy them similar battles are expected for party whip , the no 3 post , and potentially for the conference chair should ms mcmorris rodgers leave that position representative peter roskam of illinois was urging his colleagues not to rush to choose a new team , encouraging them instead to meet and form a concrete plan of action first we need a plan , not a person , he said in an interview mr boehner expressed that exasperation on sunday , accusing the hardliners , in an when he was asked if the hardliners were unrealistic absolutely they 're unrealistic ! he said , almost shouting but the bible says beware of false prophets and there are people out there spreading noise about how much can get done i mean , this whole idea that we were going to shut down the government to get rid of obamacare in 2013 , this plan never had chance in the presidential race , party leaders face a delicate balance between appealing to an angry grassroots hungry to upend the party s leadership and placating donors who do not want to risk losing the white house for a third straight election mr slayton , who called mr cruz a 45stateloss prospect in a general election , said the party needed to find a nominee who can be a peacemaker and a bridge builder between factions supporters of jeb bush , the former governor of florida , who began the race as a presumptive favorite , and others believe that activists will eventually become more focused on finding a candidate who can win a general election and move past their early flirtations with outsiders i think over time you 're going to see people coming back to realize that we 've got to have an adult in the room , a person that can beat a democrat , said fred zeidman , a texas contributor to mr bush , who has been eclipsed so far by mr trump mr zeidman said mr boehner s exit worried him a great deal because it might embolden the hardliners in congress if we shut the government down , we 're dead , he said
with a debate performance that was steely and at times deeply personal , appears to have improved her standing in the race to be the republican nominee but even if she falls short , she took a big stride toward filling a role her party badly needs a credible antidote to the gender gap and the democrats' claims of a republican war on women the question , as many republicans see it , is whether they can seize on the opening a series of events building on the horizon threatens to feed into efforts by the democrats to paint the republican party as tonedeaf on women s issues republicans in

groups that argue they are unconstitutional but with hillary rodham clinton s popularity falling among women as questions about her honesty and integrity continue to shroud her , many republicans are beginning to see mrs fiorina as someone who , if she is not the presidential nominee , is a much more serious contender for the vicepresidential nomination or a large leadership role of some kind within the party if she s not on the ticket , they would be foolish not to offer her a key role in the next administration , said penny young nance , president of concerned women for america , a conservative organization the republican party , she said , has begun to correct its past mistakes of neglecting its female talent i think they 're learning their lesson at the on wednesday night , mrs fiorina spoke directly to the women watching in a way that none of the 10 men with her on stage could and yet she was cautious about embracing the role of the sole female on the stage at one point , she was the heartbroken mother describing how she lost her stepdaughter to drug abuse , she revealed a painful episode that many people watching were unaware of my husband frank and i buried a child to drug addiction she said she knew how disgusted women everywhere must have felt when mr trump said and then later denied saying that she was too ugly to be president i think women all over this country heard very clearly what mr trump said , she responded and as some of the men around her struggled to name a woman who was not an immediate family member to put on the 10 bill , mrs fiorina dismissed the whole exercise as empty symbolism i think , honestly , it s a gesture i do n't think it helps to change our history , she said we ought to recognize that women are not a special interest group her answer on the 10 bill question , said kristen soltis anderson , a republican pollster and author , was instructive in how it revealed mrs fiorina s discomfort with being seen as someone trying to capitalize on her gender she resists that , ms anderson said , noting that her own research has shown younger women do not find it as important to vote for the first female president as older women do it s older women who are more likely to confess , yeah , i give hillary clinton bonus points because she s a woman , ' ms anderson added , whereas younger woman say , i know there s going to be a woman president in my lifetime , so we should just focus on who the most qualified candidate is' winning the female vote is challenging for any republican women have traditionally identified strongly with the democratic party , while male voters are split between the two parties the largest gender gap ever was recorded in the 2012 presidential election 20 percentage points , according to gallup mitt romney won among men by 8 percentage points while president obama won women by 12 percentage points over all but among white women , mr obama lost with just 42 percent to mr romney s 56 percent to win the white house in 2016 , republicans would almost certainly need to win more than 56 percent of the white female vote many see mrs fiorina as a way to help them do that , either as the nominee or in some other role many republicans will see her , even if she s not the nominee , as that magic key that can unlock the gender gap , said bruce haynes , president of purple strategies , a republican consulting firm that s a challenge that many have feared has been set in concrete over time but building a credible campaign , mr haynes added , is far more difficult than having a strong debate performance and keeping that credibility intact could get much harder in a government shutdown you do n't control the agenda , and you have to react to the agenda of others such as congressional republicans who want to back everybody up against a wall as usual , he said for her part , mrs fiorina is siding with the hardliners in her party who want to see a veto showdown with mr obama , who has said he will reject any attempt to take away planned parenthood s funding this is about the character of our nation , she said emphatically at the debate , receiving some of the most vigorous applause of the night and if we will not stand up and force president obama to veto this bill , shame on us democrats said that voters should not be confused about what mrs fiorina is really saying you do that and the government shuts down plain and simple , said representative debbie wasserman schultz , chairwoman of the democratic national committee she is indistinguishable , other than her gender , from her counterparts on that stage democrats quickly exposed a flaw in mrs fiorina s debate comments about the undercover videos of planned parenthood that have led to the calls to eliminate its funding she dared the president and mrs clinton to watch the tapes , saying , watch a fully formed fetus on the table , its heart beating , its legs kicking while someone says we have to keep it alive to harvest its brain the video that mrs fiorina seems to be referring to does show a still image of a fetus being held outside the womb but it is not seen squirming as mrs fiorina describes , nor is there any indication that it is about to have its brain removed with her social and fiscal conservatism , mrs fiorina would seem to be a good fit for a republican nominating contest a general election , however , is something some democrats said they would welcome she was mitt romney before mitt romney was mitt romney , said mark mellman , the democratic pollster who worked on the 2010 senate race in which senator barbara boxer defeated mrs fiorina by 10 percentage points , in large part by highlighting how as chief executive of hewlettpackard she had cut tens of thousands of jobs mrs fiorina not only lost that race 52 to 42 percent , she lost women too , getting only 39 percent of their votes , according to exit polls

the exaggerations and halftruths that some republicans president obama s important and necessary nuclear deal with iran are beyond ugly invoking the holocaust , mike huckabee , a contender for the republican presidential nomination , has accused mr obama of marching israelis to the door of the oven tom cotton , a senator from arkansas , has compared secretary of state john kerry , who helped negotiate the deal , to pontius pilate what should be a thoughtful debate has been turned into a vicious battle against mr obama , involving not just the republicans but israel s prime minister , benjamin netanyahu the unseemly spectacle of lawmakers siding with a foreign leader against their own commander in chief has widened an already dangerous breach between two old allies policy considerations aside , what is most striking about the demagoguery is how ahistorical , if not downright hypocritical , it is negotiating with adversaries to advance a more stable world has long been a necessity , and republican presidents have been among its most eager practitioners richard nixon normalized relations with china when it was considered a communist menace ronald reagan signed a landmark missile agreement with the soviet union , which had fomented unrest worldwide and persecuted jews the agreement eliminated an entire category of missiles mr reagan even negotiated with iran after the islamic revolution , selling it arms to use in its struggle with iraq and using the proceeds to arm nicaragua s contra rebels in defiance of congress critics complain that the nuclear deal fails to eradicate all of iran s nuclear program , even for peaceful energy production , and provides sanctions relief , including access to 50 billion in iranian assets frozen in foreign banks but what these critics do not mention is that the basic bargain mr obama agreed to benefits in exchange for nuclear limits was endorsed by president george w bush and the other major powers in 2006 though mr bush was certainly opposed to allowing iran to build a nuclear weapon , the proposal did not demand that iran totally dismantle its nuclear enrichment and reprocessing activities \( as critics now do \) it instead offered assurances that iran would have fuel for its civilian energy program and be integrated into the international economy two years later , the proposal was further enhanced , but talks with tehran never went anywhere negotiating with enemies is an essential component of statecraft and can be a crucial alternative to war even when america was at the height of its powers , its leaders including republicans knew that any successful deal would involve some compromise with the other side , not complete capitulation yet that is exactly what the republicans are demanding of iran today as they lay plans to repudiate mr obama s hardwon accord in pursuit of some mythical better deal the accord has shortcomings , as all do , and there are risks in any decision but a preponderance of responsible opinion the five major powers , the united nations security council , most american nuclear experts and scores of leading american diplomats have endorsed the pact as the best way to ensure that iran does not get a nuclear weapon america is stronger when important national security decisions have bipartisan consensus none of that seems to matter to the accord s opponents , many of whom never intended to vote for the deal and made clear during congressional hearings last week that facts will not change their minds

latino populace and its power structure the police , the city government which remains largely white while many hispanics have found work and stable , if not particularly affluent , lives here , the

mao , chad an oath of allegiance from boko haram , the based militant group , to the islamic state on saturday reinforces western fears that the terrorist group is growing beyond its base in iraq and syria these worries have prompted american and allied commandos to rush to train african counterterrorism troops to fight extremists on the continent the expanding effort here on the edge of the sahara to fight militancies like boko haram comes as the group has kidnapped schoolgirls , slaughtered thousands of people , and now has expanded its attacks from nigeria into cameroon , niger and  when your neighbor s house is burning , you have to put it out , because if not , yours is next , said lt col brahim mahanat , a chadian army officer who spoke during the pentagon s annual military exercise with 1 , 200 african troops , united states army special forces and other western commandos , which ends on monday more than any exercise in the past decade , this year s training three weeks of marksmanship , mock ambushes and patrols in harsh desert terrain is bumping up against realworld operations the chadian capital , ndjamena , is just 30 miles from militantheld territory in nigeria , and boko haram has vowed revenge since chad began crossborder attacks against the militants police officers and army troops have stepped up patrols in the capital in response to increased risks , including suicide bombings boko haram has , in the meantime , pushed more than 200 , 000 nigerian refugees across the border into neighboring countries and on saturday , three explosions rocked the northeastern nigerian city of maiduguri , killing dozens of people in the worst attack there since suspected islamist militants tried to seize it in january boko haram is not just a threat to our country or to africa , said brig gen zakaria ngobongue , a senior chadian officer who has trained in france and at hurlburt field , fla , and is overseeing this year s exercise they are an international threat the obama administration agrees new boko haram propaganda videos , including beheadings , mirror the releases of the islamic state and had officials in washington and european capitals watching to see if the two terrorist groups would draw closer together the announcement by the boko haram leadership that it had pledged allegiance to the islamic state , also known as or isil , was still being analyzed on saturday by western counterterrorism officials , who said the proclamation appeared to be legitimate officials suggested that boko haram , by aligning itself more closely with the islamic state , was seeking to elevate its standing in the jihadi world , attract foreign fighters and possibly win financing from the militants by allying with isis , boko haram is seeking greater validation in the global jihadi community , said laith alkhouri , a senior analyst at flashpoint global partners , a security consulting firm that tracks militant websites but american intelligence analysts said it remained unclear what specific fighting capabilities , if any , the relationship would add to boko haram , or how soon boko haram seized the world s attention last april when it kidnapped nearly 300 teenage girls in nigeria the initial abduction , none have been found since , and many are believed to have been married off to boko haram fighters last summer , the united states committed 40 million over the next three years to help nigeria , niger , chad and cameroon develop more effective border security and longrange patrolling , and to pay for weapons , ammunition , nightvision goggles and radios in a reflection of heightened american and european concerns , army special forces from fort carson , colo , as well as other american special operations and military instructors from several western countries , are training african troops here in chad to conduct combat patrols and to foil terrorist ambushes , missions many of the troops will most likely carry out against boko haram in another sign of the group s growing menace , the state department recalled from retirement last month a former ambassador with longstanding ties in africa , dan mozena , to coordinate the american diplomatic effort against the militants in west africa alone , the united states has more than 200 special operations troops at any given time instructing local soldiers , but not fighting themselves navy seals are training nigerian commandos for action in the oilrich delta air force reaper reconnaissance drones support french operations in niger and mali with the backing of western officials , african leaders have taken the unusual step of forming an 8 , 700member regional force to combat boko haram the success of this new african counterterrorism force will be a test of the obama administration s focus on training , advising and equipping african troops to deal with their own security threats , rather than using american ground troops no one is expecting it to be easy the troopcontributing nations of nigeria , niger , chad , cameroon and benin must overcome years of distrust , rivalries and disparate military abilities to forge an effective fighting unit , western and african officials said african officers , as well as observers from the united states , france and britain , met in ndjamena late last month to discuss the force s command structure and other details , but fell short of reaching a final agreement more talks are expected in the coming weeks the american strategy in africa also hinges on european partners that have historical ties to the region and forces there france has reorganized its 3 , 000 troops in the sahel a vast area on the southern flank of the sahara that stretches from senegal east to chad to carry out counterterrorism operations more effectively , officials said as part of this regional mission , called barkhane , or sand dune in french , france sent a group of 15 men last month to the city of diffa in southeastern niger , just across from nigeria , to collect intelligence on boko haram , french military officials said chad , niger and cameroon have already mobilized thousands of troops to push back boko haram , whose army of 4 , 000 to 6 , 000 fighters has overwhelmed nigeria s underequipped and poorly led troops so far troops from the three african nations have been able to reclaim in crossborder attacks some of the 30 towns in northeastern nigeria that the militants have seized over the past year chad s americantrained special antiterrorism group forces , which have fought alongside french troops in mali against al qaeda s affiliate there , are among 5 , 000 chadian troops deployed to fight boko haram in the region cameroon s israelitrained rapid intervention brigade has also fought well against the militants , western specialists said on wednesday , president idriss d by of chad said he knew the whereabouts of abubakar shekau , boko haram s leader , and called on him to surrender or risk being killed this regional response seems to have stiffened nigeria s spine as its troops have fought more effectively in recent weeks , chasing boko haram fighters out of some of the territory they controlled , western officials said they got their nose bloodied , said col george k thiebes , who commands american special operations troops in west africa still , senior american intelligence and counterterrorism officials voiced skepticism that nigeria and its neighbors would successfully contain the threat , at least initially boko haram will probably continue to solidify control over its selfdeclared islamic state in northeastern nigeria and expand its terror campaign in neighboring nigerian states , cameroon , niger , and chad , james r clapper jr , director of national intelligence , said in washington in his on feb 26 nicholas rasmussen , the head of the national counterterrorism center , told a senate panel last month , it remains to be seen if the regional parties can in concert turn that tide creating a regional force , which the participating countries initially embraced last october and the african union authorized in january , will mean overcoming years of distrust between nigeria and its neighbors regional cooperation so far has been weak , according to an internal european union assessment obtained by , a romebased security website , adding that future cooperation may be hindered by the countries' little tradition of working together and sharing a long history of local disputes , different languages the irony is not lost on poorer frenchspeaking countries riding to the rescue of nigeria , whose military s negligence and incompetence has unleashed the militant plague on everyone in the region if there was will in nigeria , boko haram would have never become what they are now , said col khassim moussa , a senior officer in chad s special antiterrorism group nigerian officials privately acknowledged that their country s military which regularly contributes troops to united nations peacekeeping operations neglected the problem for too long but nigerian officials contend that many of boko haram s heavy weapons are coming from libya and the black market , and its neighbors have failed to manage their borders african officials say a model for their operation is the african force created several years ago to combat the islamic militant shabab group in somalia that force , which includes troops from uganda , kenya and burundi , suffered through severe growing pains before emerging as a capable fighting unit here in mao , the main site for the military exercise , some 135 miles northeast of the chadian capital , african soldiers teamed with american , danish , italian , belgian and other western advisers to learn new skills , including how to counter an enemy ambush this will help them raise their game , said one senior danish instructor , who like other trainers and soldiers could not be identified under the exercise s ground rules one group of nigerian navy commandos , including many veterans of the sixyear war against boko haram , paused after fighting through a mock ambush in the rolling sandy hill , to reflect on the emerging alliance before , people felt it was all nigeria s fight , said one nigerian commando cradling his israelimade tavor assault rifle now other countries are getting involved
for 13 years , there was a steady , archetypical quality to the career of kak he was one of those famous mononyms sprinkled throughout global soccer he played for some of the biggest clubs in italy , spain and his home country , brazil each team was steeped in tradition and imposed on players the weight of its own history always , he felt a burden of immense expectation this summer , kak has wrestled with almost none of those things the concept of his current club , orlando city sc , was hatched only within the past few years , and the team began play just four months ago this new circumstance has been liberating and challenging it s very difficult when you have to build a team from nothing , kak said , smiling , in an interview friday afternoon this is what i 've learned this year , still in some ways a petri dish of a professional sports league , has two new clubs this season along with orlando , new york city fc was also coaxed into existence this year , experiencing much of the same excitement and handling many of the same obstacles in the past few months there was an aura of festivity when the two clubs met in march to open the season , and in a bit of neat symmetry convenient for the purposes of a midterm progress report the teams will meet again on sunday for a match at yankee stadium , their last before the league s allstar break through friday , orlando and nycfc had each played 20 games orlando was sixth in the eastern conference , with 24 points , and nycfc was 3 points behind the league s characteristic parity and the fact that the postseason will include 12 of its 20 teams has kept both teams in the playoff race but they will meet sunday in divergent states while acknowledging there was considerably more room for orlando to improve , kak lauded the pace of its growth and increasing stability now i think the team has an identity , he said we know what can we do nycfc , on the other hand , has continued trying to change and improve its squad , like a jet refueling in midair the game sunday could bring the debuts of midfielder andrea pirlo , veterans who are expected to reconstitute the core of the team another midfielder new to the team , frank lampard , was ruled out on saturday for a third consecutive game because of a calf injury jason kreis , the coach of nycfc , said at a news conference thursday that the current moment felt a bit like a new season within the current season besides lampard and pirlo , the team added three other players in recent weeks , with each expected to play a significant role on the team things will have to coalesce in short order at least in pirlo s case , kreis said , it helps that he seems to be a perfect fit for the team , given the tactics the club had been trying to install before his arrival it has been our directive , our objective , to play a very much possessionstyle game , a dominant game , a game where we 're looking to dictate the tempo of the match , kreis said , noting that pirlo was known for those attributes integrating the players could be hampered by physical factors pirlo is healthy , but he said last week that a monthlong vacation had left him considerably short of his optimal fitness he said it would be a gametime decision whether he played the only thing that is left to do is to get to the right physical condition in order to play at my best , pirlo said thursday through an interpreter kak said new players , like lampard and pirlo , needed to be aware that the league was a physical one and that fitness was paramount he has raved about the quality of life in the united states , and he has adjusted well on the field , scoring nine goals in 19 league games this season but he has found the competitiveness of the teams , from top to bottom , surprising , as he has watched orlando s place in the standings swing drastically during the course of a few games but this has been a motivating factor , kak said , and he has employed lofty rhetoric to characterize the club s ambitions playing for a new franchise , the orlando players have plenty of excuses , if they want them but , he said , they do not this shows how competitive the league is and how hard it will be for us to be in the playoffs , he said but we want to be there and make history in our first season
washington earlier this summer , the inspector general of the nation s intelligence agencies contacted the longtime lawyer for hillary and bill clinton with a pointed question classified information had been found in a small sample of 30 , 000 messages from the former secretary of state s private email account the inspector general , i charles mccullough iii , wanted to know from the lawyer , david e kendall , where copies of the message collection might still be stored mr kendall s answer , like so much in the story of the clinton emails , pointed in an unexpected direction the official communications of the nation s 67th secretary of state , it turned out , were handled by a little colorado it company , platte river networks , previously best known for being honored in 2012 as denver s small business of the year last week , fbi agents showed up at platte river s modest brick building , opposite a candy factory now that government secrets had been found in mrs clinton s email , the agents wanted to know about the company s security measures whether americans believe mrs clinton s decision to use only a private email account for her public business is a troubling scandal well worth an fbi inquiry , a pragmatic move blown out of proportion by republican enemies , or something in between , may depend more on their partisan leanings than the facts of the affair itself but the email account and its confusing have become a significant early chapter in the 2016 presidential race and a new stroke in the portrait of the democrats' leading candidate interviews with former state department officials , law enforcement and intelligence officials , experts on classified information and members of congress provide further insight into how the controversy developed and where it might lead mrs clinton , who has said she now regrets her unorthodox decision to keep private control of her official messages , is not a target in the fbi s investigation , which is focused on assessing security breaches against the backdrop of other current government computer security lapses , notably the largescale theft of files from the office of personnel management , most specialists believe the occasional appearance of classified information in the clinton account was probably of marginal consequence but exempting herself from the practices imposed on the 24 , 000 foreign service officers and civil service workers she oversaw has led to resentment from some former subordinates and by holding onto the official emails until the state department was prompted by congress to ask for them , and then deciding for herself which to preserve , mrs clinton may have provoked mistrust even as she asks american voters to send her to the oval office the clinton campaign declined to comment for this article republicans are eager to exploit the issue house speaker john a boehner has issued a stream of news releases on the emails and the questions he thinks they raise , while the house committee investigating the 2012 attacks on the united states mission in benghazi , libya , has expanded its inquiry to include the emails there are still unanswered questions who at the state department advised mrs clinton that she could send all her email communications from a private account \? what specific criteria did her lawyers use to decide which emails would be deleted on the grounds that they were personal \? and what exactly was the classified information that government inspectors say was improperly included in her emails \? outside the political maelstrom , some security experts believe the ultimate judgment of her conduct will come not in a court or from congress but at the ballot box i think the whole set of circumstances has been scrambled by political considerations surrounding the presidential campaign , said steven aftergood , director of the project on government secrecy at the federation of american scientists he said the inadvertent spillage of classified information into an unclassified system is quite common if there s a penalty , he said , it may cost her some votes others say more than politics is at stake i was stunned to see that she did n't use the state department system for state department business , as we were always told we had to do , said william johnson , a former air force officer who served at the department from 1999 to 2011 mr johnson said his concerns were only compounded by the discovery of classified information in the emails if i 'd done that , i 'd be out on bond right now , he said he said he believed that someone should be punished if not mrs clinton , then career employees whose job was to safeguard secrets and preserve public records it s not the end of the world she did n't give away the crown jewels , mr johnson said but this is not how things are supposed to be done the email controversy breaks into three clear phases mrs clinton s initial choices about how to set up her email her decision to destroy messages she judged to be personal and the discovery of classified information in an account where it is not allowed by law on the first day of mrs clinton s confirmation hearing in january 2009 , a longtime aide to her husband bought the internet domain name clintonemailcom from a company called network solutions in jacksonville , fla the aide , justin cooper , then shifted management of the account to an atlanta company called perfect privacy privacy was something mrs clinton valued but had rarely enjoyed as first lady in the 1990s , she had weathered multiple investigations of various alleged misdeeds and her husband s muchpublicized infidelity at a fundraiser in 2000 , she said she had decided to do without email as much as i 've been investigated and all of that , she said , why would i ever want to do email \? but changing times , and the practical needs of a secretary of state , evidently overcame that instinct when she took office in 2009 , with ever more people doing government business through email , the state department allowed the use of home computers as long as they were secure nine months later a new policy required that steps be taken to make sure emails were captured in the department s records there appears to have been no prohibition on the exclusive use of a private server it does not appear to be an option anyone had thought about a server was set up at mrs clinton s home in chappaqua , ny , evidently with backup provided in denver at platte river networks to the surprise of many colleagues , she never had a standard stategov account the role of platte river networks and the fbi s investigation was first reported by the washington post mrs clinton has said she decided in 2009 to handle all her email , official and personal , on one account to avoid carrying multiple electronic devices yet early this year she joked that she was two steps short of a hoarder so i have an ipad , a mini ipad , an iphone and a blackberry so there may have been other reasons for using a private server for an oftattacked politician considering a presidential run , the server would give mrs clinton some control over what would become public from her four years as the nation s top diplomat i 've been following it very carefully , said shiva ayyadurai , an email pioneer who has designed email systems for both government and large corporations a private system , he noted , would make it possible to decide what would be disclosed and what would not there is another factor that some former colleagues say puts mrs clinton s decision in a more reasonable light the archaic , dysfunctional computer systems at the state department only a tiny fraction of emails sent on the stategov system in recent years have been permanently archived and former state department employees describe the unclassified email system in 2009 as frustratingly inadequate using state department email outside the building involved incredibly unreliable software , said one former senior official if you had to write a priority message that was more than a paragraph long , it could leave you streaming sweat and screaming at the screen and that s when people would turn to their private accounts out of desperation another official described landing in foreign capitals late at night and having to go to the american embassy and wake people up simply to check his unclassified email he called the situation ludicrous , though he said the system slowly improved , especially as more people got government blackberry devices all of these former officials asked not to be named , fearing they might offend mrs clinton or , worse , draw a subpoena from the house benghazi committee several former clinton aides have hired private counsel at personal expense the basic feeling is , if you have n't been mentioned by the committee , you should keep your name out of it , said one official from the emails the state department has begun releasing in stages , a pattern emerges mrs clinton rarely went in for long exchanges , preferring quick messages of a sentence or two at most , delivering pats on the back , sending queries or instructions to aides and occasionally delivering wisecracks to john d podesta , who served as her husband s chief of staff at the white house and is now the chairman of her campaign , she offered homespun advice please wear socks to bed to keep your feet warm she quizzed her aide , huma abedin , about how to use a fax machine i thought it was supposed to be off hook to work \? mrs clinton seemed to reserve sensitive subjects for facetoface meetings as her aides discussed a forthcoming new yorker profile of richard c holbrooke , the envoy to afghanistan and pakistan , she weighed in i know more about this if you wish to discuss , she wrote curiously , she seemed to want to improve her email skills she asked another aide , cheryl mills , to lend a book called send why people email so badly and how to do it better as mrs clinton and her staffers have repeatedly pointed out , most of her emails they say about 90 percent were automatically captured on state department servers because she was writing to aides and colleagues who had stategov addresses some were not captured , however , because a few top aides also used private addresses after meeting with two of her closest aides , ms mills and philippe reines , state department officials decided last year to ask for any emails in the custody of mrs clinton and of her three predecessors as secretary of state , who said they had none she turned over 30 , 490 emails last december , nearly two years after leaving office but it turned out that she had destroyed a slightly larger number of messages from her account 31 , 830 because she or her aides judged them to be personal in nature at the end , i chose not to keep my private , personal emails , she told reporters in march emails about planning chelsea s wedding or my mother s funeral arrangements condolence notes to friends , as well as yoga routines , family vacations the other things you typically find in inboxes no one wants their personal emails made public that explanation might win public sympathy but it did not take long for evidence to surface that the culling may have included some workrelated emails as well in june , the state department said that it had not been able to find in mrs clinton s emails some 15 messages from sidney blumenthal , an old friend and aide , who had independently turned them over to the house benghazi committee the messages involved libya mr blumenthal was passing along analysis from a former cia officer and they appeared to involve policy the clinton campaign has not explained the discrepancy in sorting through more than 60 , 000 emails , it is easy to imagine slipups but this small window on the deletion process , carried out privately by mrs clinton s lawyers and aides , offered little assurance to skeptics that the work email collection was complete shortly after mrs clinton said in march that her private email account had contained no classified information , the republican chairmen of the senate intelligence and foreign relations committees decided to test that claim the senators richard m burr of north carolina and bob corker of tennessee , asked the inspectors general for the state department and intelligence community to investigate whether she and other state department officials had kept classified information on personal email accounts mr mccullough , a former fbi agent and the watchdog for the intelligence agencies , took the lead in examining mrs clinton s emails in 900 pages of emails about libya that the state department had handed over to the benghazi committee , his team found one email they judged to contain classified information but the state department had already posted it on the web mr mccullough then looked at a sample of 40 more messages and found four that he concluded contained information that should have been marked secret in last month s courtordered state department release of an additional 2 , 200 pages of emails , 64 passages from 37 messages were blacked out because they were judged too sensitive to be released officials said hundreds more messages from the full archive might contain classified information because the classified passages are blacked out , it is impossible to gauge how much damage their disclosure might have caused there is a broad consensus that the government classifies far too much innocuous material if you 're assistant secretary or above , said one former diplomat who held such a post , it s hard to burp without someone thinking it s classified moreover , spillage the technical term for classified information slipping into an unclassified system is so common that the government has a protocol to deal with it a 2008 guide , national instruction on classified information spillage treats it as a regrettable but notsorare occurrence it lays out how such errors should be assessed and reported , mentioning , well down in the todo list , determine whether the incident should be referred to the department of justice for investigation and or criminal prosecution in the case of mrs clinton s email , the fbi is conducting an investigation of just how the classified material was stored in denver , as well as on a thumb drive kept by her lawyer , mr kendall , and whether it might somehow have landed in the hands of adversaries officials say the bureau at this point has no target in mind and no evidence that a crime was committed but the investigation takes place in an administration that has taken an especially hard line on the handling of classified information scott gration , ambassador to kenya , resigned after a 2012 inspector general s report accused him of flouting government rules , including the requirement that he use state department email he has willfully disregarded department regulations on the use of commercial email for official government business , the report said a new york firefighter and decorated combat veteran who served in the marines in afghanistan , jason brezler , is currently fighting dismissal from the marine corps for sending , via his personal account , an email attachment the government says was classified his lawyer , kevin carroll , says he sent the message in response to an emergency request from a base in afghanistan mrs clinton and her aides have noted that the material the inspectors general call classified was not labeled as such in the emails but in 2010 , thomas drake , a former senior national security agency official , was indicted under the espionage act for keeping an agency email printout at home that was not marked as classified \( mr drake pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor \) j william leonard , a former director of the government s information security oversight office , said that in mrs clinton s case , criminal charges like those against mr drake are highly unlikely but as a former security official , he said , he was dismayed by her exclusive use of private email the state department has an obligation to monitor unclassified email for exactly this kind of classified spillage , he said , as well as to protect computer systems and provide emails to congress or the public when required by law the agency ca n't fulfill those legal responsibilities if it does n't have control over the server , mr leonard said the man whose dogged benghazi investigation brought to light the email issue , representative trey gowdy , republican of south carolina , insists he is not running a partisan witch hunt to damage mrs clinton s presidential run a former prosecutor and chairman of the select committee , he said in an interview that what he called this arrangement she had with herself has raised important questions about preserving public records and protecting government secrets mr gowdy expressed satisfaction that the email investigation is now in the hands of the premier law enforcement agency in the world , the fbi the discovery of the email issue alone refutes claims that after multiple congressional inquiries into benghazi , there was nothing more to find , he said the committee s top democrat , representative elijah e cummings of maryland , said his concern has always been that the benghazi inquiry which he said comes on top of seven or eight investigations already conducted would become a tool for republicans who want to bash mrs clinton he said he believed that to a considerable degree , that is what has happened we have basically an unlimited budget to go after hillary clinton , he said but mr cummings noted that the former secretary of state has herself said it was a mistake to use only the private email , and said he agreed that it was inappropriate i think it s very important that the public knows what s going on with regard to government , he said i think the public should have access to that information , period
i m the only mother i know who is happy to see her daughter cry not because she deserves to , but because after everything she has faced , her tears are our first glimpse of emotions that have been missing for a very long time i was told i had cancer three and a half years ago not horrible cancer , but the kind that ensures you will never feel safe again , even though statistically you know you should my husband learned he had cancer over five years ago his is horrible cancer the kind that even though he has gone remarkably long feeling great , could strike back anywhere at any time and kill him within months , and once , almost did my cancer experience , and my husband s has been long and challenging but my children have suffered as much as we have , maybe more because cancer is caught earlier , treated more aggressively , and patients are living longer , the survivor population is growing , and so are the numbers of loved ones attached to those patients children today are less likely to lose a parent to cancer , but that in turn means they re more likely to have to navigate the minefield of posttreatment trauma all three of my children \( 14 , 10 and 8 \) , clutched the lap bar of our cancer roller coaster car for years before my husband s and my health normalized enough that their own emotional ride could begin until they could throw their own hands up , heads back and let out screams that had been buried under layers of fear , anger and survival instincts while my two sons excavated their feelings in perhaps more predictable ways \( questions , tears and temper tantrums \) , my daughter , the oldest , withdrew when our cancer journey began , my firstborn s booboos could be soothed with a kiss we had the special motherdaughter connection i yearned for and worked hard to create then her father got sick acting as an advocate for someone who was given a sixweek prognosis required almost all of my focus i knew i should be doing more to salve my children s emotional wounds , but to tend to my husband s needs , everything and everyone else came second i could sense my daughter s muted affect , but in my haze of icus and clinical trials , i mistook her lack of emotion for fear and reassured her the best way i knew i told her that there was at least one thing she shouldn t fear i wasn t going anywhere i never imagined those words might come back to haunt me my husband s cancer was still quite uncertain when mine surfaced , and all the attention paid to him shifted to me i felt guilty and selfish as a mother for stealing the focus that should have been on her worse , i felt duplicitous for threatening her with the loss of another parent the one who said she would never leave and yet , through all of the upheaval , the treatments , surgeries and hairless heads , i didn t see my daughter cry once perhaps she was afraid to cry in front of her brothers , afraid to scare them further or certain that if one tear escaped she would be unable to contain the flood that followed i also never saw her angry she never gave a teacher any trouble never hit her brother or threw a dish never gave me a sarcastic glance or an angry scream about lying that i d never go anywhere instead , wall after steely wall went up around her young , vulnerable heart to protect it from breaking , barricading me out in the process i hoped that once the acute health crises were over we could relink , that she would trust me with more than the cursory fine when asked how she was doing that i would look and see the spark finally return in her green eyes , once so bright it twinkled through her hornrimmed glasses that she and i would share the special motherdaughter bond we once enjoyed but it didn t happen that way maybe she was afraid to love me in case i died my daughter is now just a few inches shorter and pounds lighter than me , and her glasses have long since been replaced by contacts after struggling for so long to connect with her , we finally reached out to a therapist in the last six months i have seen more tears flow than in the previous six years combined , and with each one i see a little more of her come back still , when she cries , when she hurts , when her heart breaks , my first instinct is to pull her into my lap , and allow her to cry into my shoulder i want to rub and soothe all of her pain away none of that works anymore she won t let me this girl who couldn t get too close now needs space when i try to hug her , she doesn t hug back when i rub , she bristles it hurts me and leaves me with a deep , irrational and selfish feeling of rejection so now i try and establish a connection with her that looks different but feels similar to what we once shared rather than nestling her as i rock back and forth , stroking her hair , we sit hiptohip on her single bed and discuss what is bothering her instead of cradling her with my body , i try to do it with my words i hope it s simply puberty that has brought on her resistance to my physical affection , and that it will pass , but deep down i m afraid she will never allow me to get close again even then i m thankful , because though i m sometimes the source of her pain i m also the receptacle for it because in the end it is me who sits next to her when she wants to share those buried feelings that somehow my words still offer her a slice of comfort , even if my touch doesn t with time , the help of good counselors , and with each conversation , the relationship between my daughter and me continues to evolve i often wonder if it s cancer that makes me ache to get close and if it s cancer that prevents her from allowing me to but these are questions that only time and patience can answer understanding why she is distant and the guilt i feel surrounding it are just two more spokes on a cancer wheel that continues spinning long after my hair has grown to my shoulders and my husband s scars have blended in with the rest of his skin hopefully her scars will start to fade , too
of the four teams that started 15 , none are more shocking than the , who seem a lock to miss the postseason for only the second time in eight seasons under john harbaugh of little comfort to baltimore fans is that all of the team s games have been close still , harbaugh makes no excuses it s disappointing to lose these close games the way we 're losing them , harbaugh said after last week s loss to the 49ers the bottom line is we 're not good enough to win them right now a rare bright spot has been the play of wide receiver steve smith , who continues to put up great numbers with smith at the end of the season , on the ravens to try to trade him to a title contender one of them is smith s former team , the carolina panthers but smith and the panthers have since they split , so that is an unlikely move on the other side , the cardinals appear firmly in control of the nfc west and are 154 at home under coach bruce arians quarterback carson palmer is having one of his best seasons he threw for 400 yards in a game for the eighth time in his career in a loss to pittsburgh last week look for them to get back on track in this one if they can get their running game , which was held to fewer than 100 yards for the first time this season against the steelers , going again this week
there are many unspoken postulates in literary criticism , one being that the more one writes , the less remarkable one s work is apt to be joyce carol oates , the author of more than 50 novels \( not counting the 11 written under the pseudonyms rosamond smith and lauren kelly \) , understands perfectly how little use critics have for prolific writers in one of her journals she wrote that she seemed to create more , certainly , than the literary world allows for a serious' writer as with most postulates dealing with subjective perceptions , the idea that prolific writing equals bad writing must be treated with caution mostly , it seems to be true certainly no one is going to induct the mystery novelist john creasey , author of 564 novels under 21 different pseudonyms , into the literary hall of heroes both he and his creations \( the toff , inspector roger west , sexton blake , etc \) have largely been forgotten the same is true of the british novelist ursula bloom \( over 500 published works , under many pseudonyms \) , barbara cartland \( over 700 \) and a host of others one is reminded of truman capote s famous bon mot about jack kerouac that s not writing , that s typing yet some prolific writers have made a deep impression on the public consciousness consider agatha christie , arguably the most popular writer of the 20th century , whose entire oeuvre remains in print she wrote 91 books , 82 under her own name and nine under a mary westmacott or her married name , agatha christie mallowan those novels may not be literary , but they are far above the porridge turned out by john creasey , and some of them are strikingly good christie gave us two characters miss marple and hercule poirot who have achieved a kind of immortality add to this the stylistic and thematic unity of christie s novels \( the cozy warmth of the settings and the british stereotypes , placed within the context of her surprisingly cold appraisal of human nature \) , and one must view those many books in a different light the same can be said of the prolific , mid20thcentury writer john d macdonald his travis mcgee novels now seem embarrassingly dated , and many of his over 40 standalone novels are an indigestible mix of ernest hemingway and john o'hara , but when macdonald forgot about his literary heroes and wrote strictly for himself , he did striking work the best of his novels , the end of the night and the last one left , rise to the level of that shapeshifting beast we call american literature no one in his or her right mind would argue that quantity guarantees quality , but to suggest that quantity produces quality strikes me as snobbish , inane and demonstrably untrue then consider the other end of the spectrum donna tartt , one of the best american novelists to emerge in the last 50 years , has published just three novels since 1992 jonathan franzen , the only american novelist who is her equal , has published five \( his latest , purity , will appear on tuesday \) it is easy to look at those few books , each of extraordinary quality , and conclude that the fewer the better perhaps the recently retired philip roth wrote multiples more than the two of them combined , and our gang was pretty awful but then , american pastoral seems to me a much finer novel than either ms tartt s the goldfinch or mr franzen s freedom i'm a recovering alcoholic , have n't had a drink in almost 27 years , and these days the thought of drinking rarely crosses my mind yet when i think about those eight novels by ms tartt and mr franzen not enough to fill even a quarter of a library bookshelf i'm reminded of a lunch i had with my wife not too long after i sobered up there were two older ladies at a nearby table they were conversing with great animation over their meals , while their halffinished glasses of white wine stood forgotten in the middle of the table i felt a strong urge to rise from my place and speak to them only that s not right i felt an urge to actually hector them to say , why do n't you drink your wine \? it s sitting right there , for christ s sake some of us ca n't drink wine , we do n't have that privilege , but you can , so why the heck do n't you do it \? the long gaps between books from such gifted writers make me similarly crazy i understand that each one of us works at a different speed , and has a slightly different process i understand that these writers are painstaking , wanting each sentence each to carry weight \( or , to borrow the title of one of jonathan franzen s finest novels , to have strong motion \) i know it s not laziness , but respect for the work , and i understand from my own work that haste makes waste but i also understand that life is short , and that in the end , none of us is prolific the creative spark dims , and then death puts it out william shakespeare , for instance , has n't produced a new play for 400 years that , my friends , is a long dry spell this is not a roundabout way of justifying my own prolificacy yes , i 've published more than 55 novels yes , i have employed a pseudonym \( richard bachman \) yes , i once published four books in one year \( shades of james patterson except mine were longer , and written without the aid of a collaborator \) and yes , i once wrote a novel \( the running man \) in a single week but i can say , with complete honesty , that i never had any choice as a young man , my head was like a crowded movie theater where someone has just yelled fire ! and everyone scrambles for the exits at once i had a thousand ideas but only 10 fingers and one typewriter there were days i'm not kidding about this , or exaggerating when i thought all the clamoring voices in my mind would drive me insane back then , in my 20s and early 30s , i thought often of the john keats poem that begins , when i have fears that i may cease to be before my pen has glean 'd my teeming brain i imagine it was that way with frederick schiller faust , better known as max brand \( and best known as the creator of dr kildare \) he wrote at least 450 novels , a feat rendered more remarkable by his ill health and premature death at the age of 51 alexandre dumas wrote the count of monte cristo and the three musketeers and some 250 other novels and there s isaac asimov , who sold his first short story at 19 , hammered out more than 500 books , and revolutionized science fiction my thesis here is a modest one that prolificacy is sometimes inevitable , and has its place the accepted definition producing much fruit , or foliage , or many offspring has an optimistic ring , at least to my ear not everyone feels that way i remember a party where some selfappointed arbiter of literary taste joked that joyce carol oates was like the old lady who lived in a shoe , and had so many children she did n't know what to do in truth , ms oates knows exactly what she is doing , and why she is doing it i have more stories to tell , she writes in her journals , and more novels i'm glad of that , because i want to read them
it s become a familiar sight kuala lumpur s famous skyline , dominated by the petronas towers , misted over as if in a watercolor and in the streets , more and more people wearing surgical face masks those who stay outdoors for too long notice a smoky taste in their mouths , and then often complain of sore throats and breathing difficulties welcome to southeast asia s season of haze in singapore , about 200 miles south , similar problems threatened the smooth running of the recent formula one grand prix , a highlight of the island republic s social and sporting calendar all over and indonesia , schools closed , flights and politicians from each of the three countries engaged in fingerpointing and blameshifting for the last two decades , a cloud of pollution has drifted over the region at this time of year , causing billions of dollars' worth of disruption the smoke in indonesia , where large corporations and small landowners alike take advantage of the dry season to clear the land of forest and crops to make way for paper production or palm oil plantations the crude , cheap slashandburn method they employ has disastrous consequences over large areas , igniting peat in the soil to create fires that burn steadily over long periods this year , weather patterns associated with the el ni o system unusually dry conditions , exacerbating the hazeproducing fires that the haze affects millions in indonesia is bad enough but sumatra , where the worst of the fires occur , is a mere 40 miles across the strait of malacca from the malaysian peninsula and singapore , while kalimantan , the other principal source of the smoke , shares a 1 , 200mile land border with malaysia the resulting transboundary haze , as it is known , has placed mounting pressure on the indonesian government to devise a longterm solution and it has exposed the inability of the association of southeast asian nations to cooperate on crossborder issues that originate in one member state at a recent asean meeting in kuala lumpur , an indonesian member of parliament in charge of international relations and environmental affairs issued a formal apology to malaysia and singapore for this year s disruption this echoed previous apologies made by indonesian leaders , notably the former president susilo bambang yudhoyono s following the recordbreaking 2013 haze for many malaysians and singaporeans , these mea culpas ring hollow , given the continued absence of any concrete countermeasures malaysia s air pollution index assigns scores to common pollutant gases and particulate matter based on their concentrations in the atmosphere , and then gives an aggregate reading a level of 101 to 200 is considered unhealthy , 201 to 300 very unhealthy , and over 301 hazardous in september , the index in some parts of the country persisted above the 200 mark in singapore , readings 341 , at one point casting doubt over whether the grand prix including outdoor concerts by maroon 5 and bon jovi could go ahead such jitters are not without a basis in 2013 , when air pollution levels in singapore passed the 400 mark and the neighboring johor state of malaysia a level of more than 700 , the singapore government estimated that increased spending on health care , together with disruption to air and maritime traffic , its economy 1 billion per week the blame , according to regional observers , lies in indonesia s failure to rein in the powerful corporations that run the increasingly lucrative palm oil plantations in sumatra and kalimantan rising worldwide consumption and booming prices have made the commodity a major contributor to the indonesian economy , by 2012 , about 11 percent of the country s export earnings , second only to oil and gas despite harsh penalties for those who break the strict landclearing laws , there have been few successful prosecutions which critics attribute to the plantation companies' strong political connections indonesia , meanwhile , claims that it is stepping up actions against those responsible it cites the recent landmark of the palm oil company pt kallista alam more than 30 million for starting fires in sumatra in 2012 as proof that it is taking tough action to tackle the problem officials also hit back at criticism from their neighbors by pointing out that malaysian and singaporean companies also operate in the affected regions at the height of the 2013 fires , the indonesian minister in charge of the crisis singapore of behaving like a child much of the frustration felt in malaysia and singapore lies in the lack of institutional means to force indonesia s hand asean , which provides a forum for the region s diplomatic relations , was formed on principles of national sovereignty and nonintervention an approach that none of its members are keen to upset there was a small measure of progress last month when indonesia with singapore a list of individuals and companies under investigation this would at least enable singapore to make checks on any that also operate within its jurisdiction although there are no specific details yet , malaysian and indonesian officials have agreed to sign a memorandum of understanding outlining measures to deal with the fires in the future asean s agreement on transboundary haze pollution , created in 2002 , was by indonesia only last year its wording does not confer on asean any powers of enforcement last month , jakarta help from the singaporean government in fighting the fires while the political tussles continue , indonesia remains the worst victim of its fires , with pollution readings reaching a record high of 984 in the central province of riau , where 26 , 000 cases of acute respiratory ailments have been recorded this season as always during the haze , thousands of army and police personnel were sent in to combat the fires , and cloudseeding operations were tried but much like the skies overhead , the political way ahead for the region remains murky
louisville , ky they are ethereal pursuits , creating wine and fast thoroughbreds both require vision both take time both are at the mercy of mother nature when you get it right , the rewards are lofty a wine that scores 100 points or a horse that wins the kentucky derby barbara banke entered each business with her husband , jess jackson , who died in 2011 together , they saw 15 of the jackson family wines score 100 and be deemed a classic they did all right on the racetrack and in the sales ring , too , campaigning curlin and the filly rachel alexandra to horse of the year titles and establishing as a top producer of quality horses the derby winners' circle , however , has been more elusive in fact , getting a horse in the race has been a chore in 2007 , curlin was sent off as the second choice but found trouble from his inside post before recovering to finish third he went on to win the preakness stakes and enough premier races to be recognized as the best racehorse in north america for that year and the next , 2008 but the derby is the derby , and on saturday , banke hopes to top that achievement by meeting a colt named carpe diem after the race in the most coveted real estate in the sport , where she can hoist a trophy and he can be fitted with a blanket of roses they are going to need some luck even though carpe diem has won four of his five races impressively , this is as deep a field as the derby has seen in decades it is topped by an undefeated colt , dortmund , and another , american pharoah , who has dazzled in winning his previous four races by a combined 22 lengths luck and patience , of course , are staples of the wine business , too you can believe that a piece of ground will be great for pinot noir , but it takes eight years to see it in the bottle , banke said we are farmers , which means we are dependent on the weather , but like with the horses , there is hope every year , there s a new crop when , many in the horse business wondered if banke would turn her back on a sport that her husband had spent the better part of a decade upending jackson was a showman with a righteous streak he wrote oversize checks for first curlin and then rachel alexandra , after they had shown their talent on the racetrack he then set out imaginative campaigns for them , showing them off from kentucky to new york and new jersey to dubai but jackson also successfully lobbied for legislation here that helped clean up the backroom shenanigans of horsetrading , where what was called a commission often looked more like a bribe or a kickback he laying out how he claimed to have been defrauded in horse sales , and he dragged in prominent breeders , including a former kentucky governor , for uncomfortable depositions there also were threats on his life , prompting increased security measures within and beyond horse country everybody in the business wondered what would happen to stonestreet after jess died , said elliott walden , the president and chief executive of winstar farm , which coowns carpe diem you want people like barbara and jess in the business they put their money where their mouth is and support the good things going on they need not have worried banke not only is as competitive as jackson was , but she also has found true solace amid the foaling barns and pastures of stonestreet farms while jackson family wines controls 38 , 000 acres of postcardperfect land in australia , chile , france , italy , south africa and california , banke prefers to spend her time on her horse farm in the heart of lexington s bluegrass country , which is home to 110 of the finest pedigreed broodmares and their foals that skitter through its pastures barbara is passionate about the business of horse racing and loves every step in the process , said john moynihan , stonestreet s bloodstock agent if we have a mare foaling at 1 am and another at 5 am , she is up watching both of them she knows every horse she owns , and there are no shortcuts with her stonestreetbred horses have earned more than 31 million in purses and included 24 graded stakes winners last year , they rang up more than 72 million at the yearling

, rachel alexandra , the filly who captured the heart of casual fans by beating the boys , most memorably in the 2009 preakness stakes , was doing what she was meant to do after retiring having babies and presumably passing on her speed and grit instead , after giving birth to an extralarge foal , rachel alexandra sustained damage to her colon that led to a stomach infection and six hours of lifeordeath surgery banke , a breast cancer survivor , had helped transform the filly into a fundraiser for the disease , a symbol of female empowerment and an unlikely celebrity who for vogue magazine the equine surgeons did not give rachel alexandra much of a chance to survive , but as banke spent night after night in a chair outside her stall at rood riddle equine hospital in lexington rachel alexandra s breeding days are over , but she is perhaps the farm s most beloved horse it was the worst winter i 've ever had , banke said all because of bad luck on her last foaling with carpe diem , banke is trying to weld her ambitions to common sense the son of giant causeway was the standout in last year s 2yearoldintraining sale in ocala , fla , which meant he was going to be expensive she wanted the colt , but she needed a partner and knew through moynihan that walden and winstar were willing to split the cost both were not only looking for a derby winner , but a top stallion prospect carpe diem s pedigree and talent suggested he fit the bill it was a nobrainer for us , walden said of winstar , which won the 2010 derby with super saver if we get lucky with him , we are partners with a farm that has a broodmare line second to none and can support him as a stallion for banke , half of the 16 million price carpe diem fetched was better than all of it when you are buying into a 2yearold , you know the prices are astronomical and that a lot of them do n't work out , she said this way if it does n't work , you 're only half as unhappy whatever happens with carpe diem on saturday and beyond , banke promised to remain a horsewoman to continue her late husband s push for reform jess jackson , but his widow has been she sits on several boards and has been vocal about how drugs should be eliminated from racing , especially on race day for her , it is a bottomline issue as well as a humane one like the wine business , the horse industry has become global while banke s yearlings sell at the top of the market in america , they rarely hit that stratum at international sales there s the perception that the drugs impact the kind of horses we are breeding , banke said i should get better prices over there , and the rest of the world should know there are a lot of positive things going on over here
patrick stickles , the lead singer of the brooklyn via new jersey punk band titus andronicus , calls his new album a 29track , 93minute , fiveact rock opera about his manic depression called the most lamentable tragedy \( merge \) precious and belabored he means it lovingly , with a realistic amount of selfdeprecation , long a key tenet of his songwriting it s that inwardlooking awareness , and mr stickles s caustic wit , which spares no one , that consistently keeps titus andronicus on the right side of pretentious grandeur \( somehow even on , another concept album , in which he used civil war imagery to address heartbreak and suburban angst \) on its fourth fulllength album , out tuesday , titus andronicus is doubling down on everything that has made it beautiful and absurd multimovement songs , including a pair of nineminute epics thrashing shoutalongs with unabashedly big guitar riffs and therapistcouch honesty now there is also singing about time travel , covers of daniel johnston and the pogues , a sloppedup rendition of auld lang syne , at least one seinfeld reference , strings \( from the indie rock goto owen pallett \) and accompanying handwritten lyrics meant to guide the listener through every obsessedover narrative turn none of which is to say this is n't a punk album on i'm going insane \( finish him \) , mr stickles just sneers the title line 24 times in two minutes , leaving time for a quick guitar solo on a recent afternoon , mr stickles was iggy pop thin and motormouthed while seated on a ratty couch inside shea stadium , the bushwick diy space that serves as titus andronicus s unofficial clubhouse \( the venue is also hosting the band for five soldout shows leading up to the album s release on mr stickles s 30th birthday \) he held forth with what could accurately be described as manic energy about the influence of his mental illness , why he prefers to spell everything out and the commercial ceiling for a rock band in 2015 these are excerpts from the conversation it s because i was traumatized by the rock opera david comes to life by a with an unprintable name it was a great album with a perfectly coherent narrative and plenty of supplemental materials as well but every review of the record said the exact same thing , which is that this record is ostensibly a rock opera but you 're never going to be able to tell what s going on because the story is incoherent and you ca n't understand what the singer is saying anyway it was extremely condescending and i wanted to avoid that at any cost as much as it would be nice if the most lamentable tragedy spoke for itself , it s not about just anything it s not about whatever the listener thinks it s about every single word in here is about one thing , from my life from this story that i very carefully constructed to illuminate something the author is still alive mostly just for one person that does that s right in my more selfaggrandizing moments , i fantasize that this could elucidate some secret truth hidden in the subconscious of some young person that s as troubled as i was five or six or three years ago , two years ago , last year , this month art has shown us time and time again that none of us are really alone in our earthly experiences we all feel alienated and freakish and grotesque consider triumph by wutang clan , which came to me in the seventh grade it does n't appear to articulate that many secret truths , but it does seem to say that there s a way to achieve a certain level of strength within yourself that does n't just get handed down from mom and dad or society the wutang clan learned that the pen is mightier than the sword , and they defeated the oppressive , inherently violent society that gave birth to them but any number of things the replacements , the cure , the smiths any kind of sensitive , crying music a couple years after wutang , i got let it be by the replacements and daydream nation by sonic youth for christmas from my father and stepmother they sowed the seeds of their own undoing there must be thousands daniel johnston is the greatest manicdepressive songwriter of them all and one of the most empowered artists ever , who never got permission from anyone roky erickson , brian jonestown massacre any deranged , demented rock star that has a movie about them , basically lil wayne , the weeknd are they not talking about their own mental illnesses when they admit in lyrics that they 're drug addicts \?

a close friend educated in the west but who moved back to tehran after the revolution and who has spent the last 35 years hoping that things one day might improve to the point where he could sell some assets , recover others , make a couple of business deals and retire in the west with the proceeds said to me on the day of the announcement of the nuclear deal with the united states and its partners well , i 've waited 35 years now i can wait a couple more if that s what it 'll take to get to normal yes , normal that s what iranians are hoping for , and what they 'll be satisfied with if other constraints on life beyond the financial are lifted as well , as president hassan rouhani has promised , i suspect that retirement in the west wo n't really be in my friend s future the deal is certainly good for iran , if the measure is its popularity among ordinary people but it is not popular for reasons that some might suggest that iran bamboozled the west into a terrible compromise if not appeasement and therefore the nationalistic and prideful people are celebrating victory over the great satan that certainly , however , could be what some iranian viewers surmised just from having watched the american congressional hearings broadcast unprecedentedly live on state tv if they paid close attention to what the detractors of the deal were lecturing secretary of state john kerry and energy secretary ernest j moniz about but , no , the iranian people long ago , depending on their political leanings , resigned themselves to the fact or satisfied themselves that their government , or more precisely the nezam the islamic system would never agree to humiliation by , let alone surrender to , foreign powers , no matter the cost to the nation what iranians were celebrating on the evening of july 14 was their version \( and perhaps as significant for them \) of the storming of the bastille a potential break with an order that included sanctions , isolation , vilification of their country , and , more importantly , their own 36 years of struggle for normalcy from the congratulatory text messages that iranians sent to each other , and the anxious walltowall television , radio , internet and newspaper coverage of the nuclear deal reached in vienna , to the spontaneous street celebrations in big cities that evening , iranians were breathing a sigh of relief that maybe , just maybe , things can get better for them economically , socially and politically another friend , a successful businessman whose affairs suffered progressively as sanctions tightened over the past six years , said to me numerous times since negotiations began that he and fellow iranians were being driven crazy by the false starts , the alternating good and bad news coming out of various locations in switzerland , vienna , new york or oman , and that despite the fact that the talks had n't ever broken down , they were hostages to watching a horror movie but not knowing if it will , like in the movies , end well knowing that i had attended almost all the sessions as a reporter , he did n't call the day the deal was announced \( as he usually did during the talks \) on my phone , though , there was a simple message from him tabreek congratulations with no exclamation point none needed few iranians were ever on the side of the delvapassan the selfproclaimed and selfnamed worried group , who made it known in ads and public statements that the country was about to give away the farm to hegemonic enemies not only did most iranians not believe that , they also realized that if the status quo continued for very much longer , there might not be much of a farm left for them to give away the excitement with which most iranians greeted the nuclear agreement was not an antirevolutionary cry , nor a verdict on the deal itself it was merely an expression of hope sorely lacking among so many iranians who could see none that the revolution with a capital r might finally be permitted its maturity the deal was simply good news for them after years of bad , even if the promised results would not , most knew , be realized overnight the parade of european leaders to tehran in the days after the deal was clinched , quick to lay a claim to business with the new iran , may have looked unseemly and even premature to outsiders , but to iranians it was a sign that their hopes were not entirely misplaced while the revolution would never be over \( so long as its leaders are around \) , at least iran would henceforth be treated as an adult , and not the errant child , of the world community when mr rouhani spoke on television at the beginning of august and thanked the country s youth for their support and their clever use of social media to help secure the historic deal , it was clear to iranians that if he gets his way their revolution will indeed have grown up mr rouhani is no mikhail gorbachev he is too confident in his and the nation s destiny but he is the politician most likely to succeed in dragging iran out of its revolutionary puberty for most americans , and even most europeans , the nuclear crisis with iran has hardly been an overwhelming preoccupation a deal or no deal despite prime minister benjamin netanyahu s dire proclamations does not factor greatly in the lives of ordinary folk on either continent , nor even in israel a deal does factor enormously in the lives of every single iranian living in the country , and even some living outside that notion was best summed up by a photograph posted on instagram and twitter of an older , chadorclad woman from behind , face invisible , sitting on a carpet in a modest tehran home while watching a flatscreen tv broadcasting the congressional grilling of mr kerry but the deal is n't about the united states anymore if iran abides by it \( even as america rejects it \) the rest of the world will too , and the united states will have killed not the deal but its own credibility , the tremendous goodwill it has in iran , and even its own economic interests and iran , the iranians know , will abide by the treaty , make do in a world without america , and will reelect , in 2017 , the president who brought them the promise of a better life
maybe those of us who write about politics and campaigns should adopt a bristly uniform of hair shirts , so that we 're constantly atoning for our sins maybe we should wear targets , the better for our critics to take aim at us oh , how we 're hated and as another presidential race takes shape , that hatred gathers force hillary clinton s protectors cast us as bloodthirsty raptors intent on finding flaw where none exists chris christie was asked what he 'd given up for lent and said that it would have been the new york times , but then his priest told him he had to forswear something he 'd truly miss scott walker thinks we 're laying an elaborate trap for him , and after the washington post if he regarded president obama as christian , he not only punted but also bellowed about gotcha questions , griping this is a classic example of why people hate washington and , increasingly , they dislike the press dislike \? increasingly \? either he was being charitable or he has n't read the polling the public s esteem for us has been abysmal for a good long while and if we 're honest , we 've brought much of it on ourselves we play petty games and barrel down pointless roads there are bad habits we should surrender not merely for lent but forever , and there are tweaks we 'd be wise to implement as we move forward with the 2016 election here s a wish list of such amendments , followed by a look at what we do right , because there s plenty of that as well i hasten to add that i have been guilty of all the high crimes and misdemeanors i describe you would think , from our rapt \( and sometimes rabid \) attention to the iowa caucuses and the new hampshire primary , that candidates face some sort of mathematical , structural imperative to wow voters there , and that these two states are nonpareil mirrors of the country hardly the importance of the contests stems chiefly from our coverage of them the momentum that winners and runnersup carry out of them is as much our decree as it is anything organic iowa is not america , just one rectangular slice of it it s about twice as rural as the rest of the nation , more religiously conservative and much less hispanic and black in 2012 , when rick santorum prevailed in the republican caucuses there , only 121 , 501 voters participated that was less than one in five registered republicans in the state of those 121 , 501 voters , 57 percent described themselves as bornagain or evangelical christians , according to the pew research center that s wholly out of whack with the concentration of such religious conservatives in the party nationally , as a i wrote about from the made clear there s a rickety logic behind our spirited plunge into the psyches , hobbies and wardrobes of candidates' other halves , and there s a sexist , gratuitously invasive edge to it yes , the marriage choice that a person makes is profoundly reflective of his or her character , but it s typically made at a young age people change , as do marriages and the idea that a spouse is a fullfledged , fully involved political partner whose priorities will color a presidential administration is highly questionable , the clintons excepted laura bush s policy imprint on george fell somewhere between marginal and invisible outside the political arena , the marriage of a person who is up for a big job is n't considered some special window or yardstick i'm hard pressed to think of business titans and corporate ceos who are judged by their spouses , and those spouses draw limited scrutiny let s take a bit of a cue from that when someone on the fringes of both the race and serious discourse says something clownish that s a cry to be noticed , ignore it this means quitting our addiction to donald trump , sarah palin and rudy giuliani , no matter how good they are for readership , ratings and belly laughs we are too often like the parents who attend only to the screeching 3yearold , plying him with gummi bears and goldfish crackers , which simply reward and ratchet up his screams meanwhile the virtuous , unexcitable older sibling is ignored , until she wins the michigan primary and leaves us no choice but a grudging , belated magazine cover some are obviously bound , in the end , for the political glue factory remember michele bachmann and herman cain in 2012 \? enough said we may wish certain snags were roadblocks and certain missteps collapses , because we think they should be or they 're sexier that way but we look foolish when we 're wrong after walker s supposed bungling of the obamachristian question , he went up in one national poll sometimes a dodge is just a dodge and a gaffe not much of a gaffe the world keeps spinning the campaign trundles on four people drinking coffee on a street corner of hardscrabble , del , or ordinary , va , do not constitute a snapshot of the electorate , no matter how fetching their town s name we err when we suggest otherwise but we have our strengths over the last decade , there s been something of a surge in the truthsquad vetting of the insults that candidates hurl and the claims that they make on the trail , in debates , at conventions it s exemplified by such popular , praiseworthy sites and writers as politifact and the washington post s glenn kessler , whose fact checker column doles out pinocchios in accordance with the size of the politician s lie this is a vital task the widely derided process stories that we do on the agility or clumsiness with which a candidate s campaign unfurls also matter , as do the introductions we give voters to a candidate s aides these provide a predictive glimpse of the candidate as chief executive of a sprawling , unpredictable enterprise , which is what the president of the united states is a president is also someone whose every word , scripted or spontaneous , is heard loudly and can have great consequence , and so most of our supposed gotcha questions are anything but they 're part of a rolling , roiling backandforth that tells voters essential truths about a politician s capabilities under a constant spotlight like the presidency s keep that in mind when candidates bemoan and disparage the media s omnipresence and hypervigilance , and remember this , too when they 're harping about our shortcomings , they 're first and foremost trying to cover up their own

gelugor , malaysia the more than 3 , 000 migrants from and who in and ended weeks of a nightmare at sea only to fall into an administrative limbo that could last years , even decades in a potential breakthrough in a crisis across southeast asia , and indonesia , and thousands more who may still be at sea , on the condition that they be returned home or resettled in third countries within a year if the past is any guide , that goal may be hard to attain few countries seem willing to accept the migrants , even those who qualify as refugees deserving asylum there is already a tremendous backlog of applicants seeking resettlement and the agencies that deal with them are overwhelmed even if we get the un refugee status , we still do n't know how long we must wait before we can be resettled , said hasinah ezahar , 28 , who survived illness , hunger and threats from the smugglers she paid for the threeweek sea journey with three of her children from western myanmar until then , our lives are just waiting her family was part of a wave of migrants from and myanmar who took to the seas seeking to escape poverty and , in the case of ethnic rohingya like ms hasinah , religious persecution there are at least 200 , 000 rohingya migrants from myanmar already in bangladesh , and only 32 , 600 of them have been granted formal protection as refugees fleeing persecution , according to the office of the far fewer , perhaps only several hundred , have been resettled from refugee camps in bangladesh over the past decade and allowed to begin new lives in other countries in malaysia , those determined to be refugees and therefore eligible for resettlement , a process that could take years , would be joining more than 45 , 000 rohingya who are already classified as refugees and are waiting to be taken in by another country they receive no government aid while they wait , nor can they legally take jobs to support themselves about 1 , 000 rohingya refugees were resettled in the united states in the last year it s a bit of a dirty little secret , but that population going to the us is largely people in malaysia who have been awaiting resettlement for 10 to 15 years , said amy smith , an executive director of , a human rights group focusing on southeast asia while the refugees wait , they cannot send their children to governmentaccredited schools and are suspended in a social and legal limbo that local charities and offthebooks jobs can only partly relieve it s very frustrating for us , said anwar ahmad , a rohingya who has lived in malaysia for 18 years and makes a living in the informal labor market we 're grateful that we can stay here , and grateful for the help we receive , but without a stronger official status , i have no future here in malaysia even the first step in that process , winning recognition as refugees through the united nations refugee agency , has become forbiddingly slow , said rohingya migrants , human rights advocates and lawyers i think the unhcr is also a bit overwhelmed with the numbers , especially so many who have been here for many , many years have not been resettled yet , said , a professor at the university of malaysia sabah , who has studied the conditions of rohingya in malaysia the numbers keep increasing and increasing many of the newcomers , especially , are not being registered even after a few months of coming over here ms smith , of fortify rights , said the refugee agency gave priority to those held in detention about 1 , 000 recent arrivals are housed in the belantik immigration detention depot in kedah state in northern malaysia \( the depot declined requests for a reporter from the new york times to enter \) those detainees , she said , might have their cases decided in seven to nine months the others will wait even longer the classification process will not necessarily end well for most of the migrants migration experts say about half of the latest wave are economic migrants from bangladesh who do not meet the requirements for refugee status they will be sent home as soon as possible , the malaysian and indonesian governments say , where their government may not welcome them with open arms prime minister sheikh hasina of bangladesh on sunday called the migrants mentally sick people who harmed the country s image , and she said they would be punished along with their traffickers , the official bangladesh sangbad sangstha news agency  the rohingya , a stateless muslim people who have long faced discrimination and have been deprived of basic rights in myanmar , are likely to meet the criteria for refugee status under international law , namely having a wellfounded fear of persecution for reasons of race , religion or nationality in their home country they would be entitled to resettlement in third countries , and the united states said last week that it would take a leading role in any multicountry resettlement effort led by the united nations refugee agency such an effort , however , has yet to materialize according to the agreement hammered out last week by the foreign ministers of thailand , malaysia and indonesia , none of those countries agreed to host any refugees permanently australia s prime minister , tony abbott , that his country would not take any refugees from the current exodus gambia said last week that it would take in all the rohingya migrants , but experts questioned whether the west african state , whose own citizens have joined the deadly migration across the mediterranean to europe , had the capacity europe has its own migration crisis , as more than 1 , 700 migrants from africa and the middle east have died trying to enter europe by sea in the first four months of this year , and more than 26 , 000 have landed it s going to be really hard , said phil robertson , deputy asia director of you have to have a number of governments say we will take quite a few rohingya , but we have n't seen that in the past decades in limbo is not an uncommon fate for refugees somali refugees have endured in a camp in kenya for more than 20 years , while generations of have grown up in camps in the middle east since the 1948 arabisraeli war many of the refugees here are likely to join malaysia s swelling underclass of rohingya refugees the united nations refugee agency says richard towle , the agency s representative in malaysia , estimates that there are an additional 30 , 000 or more rohingya who are not registered , either because their applications have not been processed or because they have not tried to register the rohingya refugees here say that malaysia has treated them better than neighboring countries , but that their lives are circumscribed by the ban on work and schools , and by the difficulty in obtaining other permits for everyday needs the most difficult thing is because the government law says we cannot work , said sahid mohammed , a rohingya man who fled his village in 2009 and made the trip to malaysia by sea he and other refugees said they made an uncertain living by working informally on building sites and in restaurants and shops , and by recycling scrap and hawking small goods we would like to work to make a contribution , and to send money to our families , but we cannot keep good jobs because the bosses look at our cards and say , you 're not allowed to work for me , ' he said some bosses use that to exploit rohingya , because they know we are working without real status mr towle said given global priorities and the size of the problem here you are not going to be able to resettle your way out of a refugee problem of this size it s not feasible we think that if people are going to be here anyway we think it is good to regularize their status and give them the right to work rohingya children in malaysia attend privately run schools , often supported by volunteers , or they do not go to school at all some of the children work as well , said dewi karina kamarulzaman , a graduate student who teaches at the peace learning center , a makeshift school in a twostory home here on penang island with more than 50 rohingya children she estimated that more than half of rohingya children in penang did not attend school , often for lack of transportation they ca n't even afford the bus fare , she said ms hasinah , who is living with her husband and the three children in a single room in a shared house , has a more pressing concern a 13yearold son she left behind because she could not afford to pay the smugglers to take all four children her family s most urgent priority is finding the means and the money to bring him to malaysia wherever we go , she said , cradling her 2yearold daughter , it must be with my son
agonizing over torture as an antiterrorism tactic how to define it and how to punish abusers , if at all has been central to national security debates since the sept 11 , 2001 , attacks the issue has received renewed attention in recent months with the release of a describing techniques used by the against terrorism suspects , practices found by senators to have been high in brutality and low in effectiveness a few pivotal questions about war s excesses come together in the decadeold case of one man , who now has the attention of , a series of video documentaries that examine major news stories of the past and their impact today this man , david a passaro , is a former army ranger who in 2003 went to work for the cia in afghanistan as an independent contractor his brief tour in that country turned out wretchedly he ended up being sentenced to more than six years in federal prison for beating an afghan prisoner who then died at an american military base near the border with pakistan despite evidence that abuses like those chronicled in the senate report were far from isolated , mr passaro s situation was singular a few dozen members of the military were courtmartialed for misconduct like the welldocumented humiliations inflicted at abu ghraib prison in iraq but mr passaro is believed to be the only ciaconnected civilian ever prosecuted for going too far so rare was his case that , to bring him to trial in this country for actions committed overseas , the justice department took the highly unusual step of invoking the , the post9 11 statute intended principally to thwart wouldbe terrorists issues raised by his prosecution reflect the broader matter of how much latitude government agents should be given in the name of keeping america safe for starters , did mr passaro s actions indeed qualify as torture \? he says no even if the answer is yes , did he have reason to believe , as he claims , that he was acting with the tacit blessing of his superiors , regardless of the government s position that it never sanctioned torture \? was he , as federal prosecutors claimed , justly put in the dock as an outlier whose unconscionable behavior broke all the rules \? or was he a convenient fall guy , as he asserts , for powerful figures who were embarrassed by shocking revelations , including those about the outrages at abu ghraib \? a bantam of a man , mr passaro had a knack for rubbing people the wrong way , and was described a decade ago by exwives and neighbors as he was said to be quick to anger and equally quick to use his fists nonetheless , he retained a security clearance in june 2003 , a civilian on a cia contract , he found himself in asadabad , on the eastern rim of afghanistan , where american forces had an outpost rocket fire was hitting that base , and the military wanted to put a stop to it a local farmer in his late 20s , abdul wali , became a suspect he fell into the hands of mr passaro , who was allowed to question mr wali even though , by his own admission , he had no training in interrogation techniques i was n't hired to be nice to these terrorists , he told retro report when interviewed in fayetteville , nc , near where he has lived since his release from prison in 2010 i was there to get a job done witnesses at mr passaro s trial told how he repeatedly beat mr wali with his fists and a heavy flashlight , and kicked him in the groin prosecutors described mr wali as being in so much pain that he asked to be shot this treatment of him went on for two days a day later , he died the cause of death was not firmly established because no autopsy was performed one year on , in june 2004 , a federal grand jury in north carolina charged mr passaro with in a somewhat unusual move , the indictment was announced by the attorney general , john ashcroft , who said that criminal acts of brutality and violence against detainees would not be tolerated no one at the trial invoked the word torture but mr passaro understood that it was , in effect , what he stood accused of he rejected any such suggestion at one point he lurched out after me , and i slapped him , he said of mr wali , adding is that assault \? it could be construed as assault but in the war on terror and in afghanistan , in asadabad , that s not assault as he saw it indicted as he was two months after damning he had become the designated scapegoat senior government officials , he said , had to show they were going to hold the cia accountable , so they had me more durable concerns raised by this case dwell on where ultimate responsibility resides when things go terribly wrong does it rest , as the government preferred to have it , solely with the man who did the beatings \? or should someone higher in the chain of command have been held accountable , for having sent in an untrained , hottempered fellow like mr passaro in the first place \? then there is perhaps the biggest question of all did signals emanating from washington give soldiers and civilians on the front line every reason to believe that , in dealing with terrorism suspects and their allies , it was ok for them even expected of them to take the gloves off \? by 2003 , the bush administration had long concluded that critical aspects of the governing the treatment of prisoners did not apply to al qaeda or the taliban the cia was handed permission to resort to waterboarding and other enhanced interrogation techniques , the phrase favored by those in authority , who assiduously avoided the word torture , let alone the idea that americans sanctioned it we all agreed this was the right thing to do for this country , said , who was white house counsel and then attorney general under president george w bush mr gonzales , now the law dean at belmont college in nashville , told retro report , we were comfortable in the application of these enhanced techniques to the most serious , the worst of the worse there was a procedure put in place , or a process imposed by the department of justice , he said certain safeguards had to be met i try not to get into discussion about what is or what is not torture , because if you believe it s torture , there s nothing i can say to dissuade you of that , he continued when i think about torture it s broken bones , electric shocks to genitalia it s pulling your teeth out with pliers it s cutting off a limb that s torture is waterboarding at the same level \? i 'd say probably not but for , who was the navy s general counsel at the start of the wars in afghanistan and iraq , the government disfigured the definition of torture beyond that , we 've dispensed with the concept of accountability , mr mora , a board member of human rights first , an advocacy group in new york and washington , said to retro report mr passaro , now 48 , insists he took his cues from the top america was angry , he said , and they believed that the cia and the military would actually be able to go out and do their jobs now , with maybe a little bit more relaxed procedures that was my belief that s kind of what s filtered down , down to us the techniques he employed elicited good information , mr passaro told retro report , and torture , he said , does not accomplish that pugnacious as ever , he said anything that i did to abdul wali , none of that constitutes torture in hindsight , i would n't have done anything different

springfield , mo ever since tom schweich , missouri s auditor and a candidate for the republican nomination for governor , took his own life in late february , his leading primary opponent , catherine hanaway , has quietly avoided the campaign trail ms hanaway , 51 , a former federal prosecutor , canceled seven campaign events , suspended her social media accounts and postponed three large fundraisers in order to give everyone an opportunity to appropriately remember tom schweich but on friday , ms hanaway eased back into the race to become the state s next chief executive , meeting with supporters in this conservative stronghold and speaking publicly for the first time in the month and one day since mr schweich s suicide the reasons that i started running for governor , the support that i 've built from donors and grassroots people around the state , none of that s changed , she said in her first interview since suspending her campaign my experience has n't changed my ability to get the job done has n't changed this campaign is going forward , building on the strength we 've accrued over the last year aside from allowing for a period of mourning , ms hanaway s absence from the trail served another purpose it shielded her from the vengeance being expressed by some people who were closest to mr schweich they have accused hanaway supporters of leading a brutal campaign against him that they say led , at least in part , to his death one component of it was an alleged antisemitic whisper campaign that mr schweich who attended an episcopal church near his home in clayton was jewish david humphreys , a joplin , mo , executive who contributes heavily to state and national republicans , said in a sworn affidavit last week that john hancock , the chairman of the missouri , whose research firm has done work for ms hanaway s campaign , was the one pushing that notion mr hancock , facing calls to step aside as chairman , has repeatedly denied that he claimed with any malice that mr schweich was jewish it is possible that i mentioned what i believed to be tom schweich s religion , but if i did so , mr hancock said in statement this month , it certainly was not in a derogatory manner ms hanaway said she did not hear about the alleged whisper campaign until after mr schweich s death when asked whether mr hancock should stay or go , she said the decision should be left to the missouri republican state committee , which elected him while ms hanaway drew distance between her campaign and the state party chairman s race , one component of the negative campaign against mr schweich hits her closer to home a week before mr schweich , 54 , took his own life , a dormant political action committee named citizens for fairness , which had been used the previous year in an unsuccessful effort to fight a smoking ban in st joseph , mo , reemerged with a radio commercial targeting mr schweich the commercial , featuring a voice actor imitating the house of cards character frank underwood , took a swipe at mr schweich s physical appearance , and said his opponents would squash him like the little bug that he is it was produced by axiom strategies , a firm also employed by ms hanaway s campaign and until the day of mr schweich s suicide , both hanaway for governor and citizens for fairness shared the same campaign treasurer , james c thomas iii , a kansas city lawyer mr thomas s name appeared on many of the campaign committees used by jeff roe , the president of axiom , in fights over ballot measures and other political campaigns on that day , the committee amended its filing with the missouri ethics commission to show a different treasurer ms hanaway said friday that she was not aware that the ad had been produced before it ran , ahead of a large republican gathering in kansas city that included both leading contenders for the republican nomination for governor she also said she had not heard of citizens for fairness but had since made it very clear that there is one candidate and one campaign , and no one should be doing any work that is independent of the campaign and the message we want to deliver it was n't my style i would n't have run it , she said what my campaign is going to be about is a positive vision for missouri , based on my experience , articulating to missourians how we can have better schools , better jobs and better work mr roe , who serves as a senior strategist for senator ted cruz s presidential campaign , declined to comment for this article former senator john c danforth , an episcopalian minister who delivered a homily at mr schweich s funeral that harshly laid some of the blame for his suicide on dirty politics , said in an interview that ms hanaway must say whether she condemns the negative tactics and , if so , whether she will dissociate herself from mr roe and mr hancock if she does n't , mr danforth said , my hope is that everybody will know that when asked whether she thought missouri politics had become too brutal , ms hanaway said it should make sense that running for governor was a tough job the fact that there s a serious conversation about who is best suited to do that and it takes place over the course of a couple of years is a good thing , she said republicans are seeking a candidate to challenge the state s attorney general , chris koster , a democrat who is mounting his own campaign for governor gov jay nixon , a democrat , must leave office under a term limit while ms hanaway has been away from the campaign trail , f other possible republican candidates have emerged , including eric greitens , a former member of the navy seals state senator mike parson , a former sheriff and john brunner , a st louis businessman mr brunner , who had an unsuccessful run for the united states senate in 2012 , has been , perhaps , the most transparent about his interest in the office an interest that has only grown since mr schweich s death mr brunner recently held a private meeting in springfield with a group of mr schweich s former supporters , including his campaign treasurer , joe passanise they want to carry the torch of tom and good government , mr brunner said in an interview there is a good set of people who thought tom was the right guy to do the job , and many of them have approached me and said , you have experience , a different kind of experience , ' and asked me to go forward on friday , sam fox , a former ambassador to belgium , a close friend and a supporter of mr schweich s campaigns , said both ms hanaway and mr hancock should step aside to prevent further harm to the republican party before the primary election in august 2016 to the exit calls , ms hanaway said there s no way i'm getting out of the race at this point
berlin on friday failed to persuade and three other central european partners to accept joint action and a quota to distribute migrants from the middle east the german foreign minister , frankwalter steinmeier , using blunt language that indicated berlin might be losing patience , called the crisis the greatest challenge the has faced in its history up to 40 , 000 people might arrive this weekend , he said double the total in an outpouring of emotion last saturday and sunday the new figures came as questions mounted about the wisdom of throwing open the borders last weekend , in a humanitarian gesture that was described as a onetime exception , but which appears to have encouraged more asylumseekers to join the migrant trail in an indication that the government was troubled about maintaining control , ursula von der leyen , germany s defense minister , announced that 4 , 000 troops were on standby a measure more often used to preserve order in natural disasters mr steinmeier stressed that germany now expects 800 , 000 migrants to arrive this year , and added , none of these will be taken in by others , so i ask for understanding , that we discuss not only those who are already here , but a fair quota of distribution of those who are still on the way his statement during talks in prague with hungarian , czech , slovak and polish counterparts suggested that neither he nor the foreign minister of luxembourg , which holds the rotating presidency of the council of the european union , had persuaded the former communist countries , which have not been immigrant destinations , to adopt quotas to house 160 , 000 migrants by the president , jeanclaude juncker the prague talks were held in anticipation of a meeting on monday of european interior ministers to discuss the juncker proposals , and there were indications on friday that heads of state and government might have to hold a summit meeting if no progress is made then officials in berlin , speaking on condition of anonymity as they groped for a solution , even mentioned using majority voting and not the traditional consensus to decide the matter that would be highly unusual in an affair so central to europe s destiny but mr steinmeier indicated that berlin is keenly aware that failure to control the situation might tip the popular mood in germany , and other countries like sweden and austria , where the welcome for the migrants has so far been mostly warm while social democrats like mr steinmeier have long supported immigration , the conservatives in bavaria s christian social union , ms merkel s partners in her centerright bloc , have long been critical , and have grown more so this week we 've lost control , said hanspeter friedrich , a former interior minister and deputy leader of the bavarian party , in the newspaper passauer neue presse throwing open the borders to migrants coming from hungary by way of austria last weekend was a failure that we will have to deal with for a long time , said horst seehofer , head of the bavarian party and governor of that state i do n't see how we will put the cork back in the bottle , he was quoted as  mr steinmeier said europe needed a common message , that not everyone who arrives has the right to asylum , or the right to a job smugglers , he said , spread such rumors and are working on purpose to lure people into undertaking dangerous journeys the harsh response to migrants in some countries in eastern and central europe has spurred debate about why many in former communist countries , which themselves spent four decades craving liberty , are in some cases unsympathetic , and even downright hostile , to those fleeing war and tyranny prime minister of hungary reiterated his criticism of migrants on friday , and he warned that his country would soon take an even harder line they have seized railway stations , refused to give fingerprints , failed to cooperate and are unwilling to go to places where they would get food , water , accommodation and medical care , mr orban said after a meeting with manfred weber , chairman of the conservative european people s party in the european parliament tougher laws on immigration go into effect tuesday , mr orban said , and migrants who cross the border illegally will be arrested at the meeting in prague , some countries repeated that immigration policy was a matter of national sovereignty lubomir zaoralek , the czech foreign minister , said , every country has to have the sovereign right to decide who it will or will not accept mr steinmeier took issue we can , as europe , say that we will shut all borders , and not let anyone else in , he said but in doing so , we would betray our values the united nations on friday gave qualified support to the juncker plan it would go a long way toward addressing the crisis , william spindler , a spokesman for the united nations refugee agency , told reporters in geneva , but he added that it was still insufficient our estimates indicate even higher needs , mr spindle said , but the focus must now be on ensuring all member states take part in this initiative , and that it is swiftly implemented elsewhere on friday , the austrian railway said there would also be no regional traffic between austria and hungary this weekend , after austria stopped rail service across the border with hungary under the pressure of migrants streaming in that prompted several groups of migrants who had arrived from hungary to start marching toward vienna along various routes , according to helmut marban , a spokesman for the police in the eastern austrian province of burgenland the main highway in the direction of vienna was closed at least for some hours on friday because of the danger of migrants marching along the road the genevabased international organization for migration said that in geneva , a record 432 , 761 migrants had crossed the mediterranean already this year , compared with 197 , 940 people crossing in all of 2014 , reuters reported the situation also continued to deteriorate in macedonia , where the authorities are scrambling to find ways to cope with an increase in the number of migrants traveling through the country more than 11 , 000 migrants entered the country in a 24hour period that ended friday , according to the united nations refugee agency , and the number was expected to remain similarly high over the next few days despite the challenges facing the country , a proposal on thursday by nikola poposki , macedonia s minister of foreign affairs , to follow hungary s example of building a fence along its border was met with harsh criticism from domestic civil organizations and political parties

scottsdale , ariz one of the ' most ardent fans is in town this week the twist is that it is a business trip for him the golfer keegan bradley cannot decide if the twinning of the phoenix open and xlix is the best or the worst possible circumstance the final round of the tournament is scheduled to end about 30 minutes before the kickoff of the game between bradley s beloved patriots and the seattle seahawks it is 31 miles from the tournament site , tpc scottsdale , to university of phoenix stadium , a commute that takes about a halfhour when traffic is flowing i 've watched every minute of every one of their games this year , bradley said monday of the patriots i do n't want to miss the start of the super bowl while bradley has patriots quarterback tom brady among his phone contacts , he had assumed he would be one of the billion people watching the telecast in his fervent search for tickets , he was not about to reach out to brady , whom he has known since the quarterback texted him out of the blue with a congratulatory message after bradley s victory in the 2011 pga championship i know how i am trying to prepare for a major , bradley said , so i would never ask anyone for tickets in the days after the patriots secured a super bowl berth , brady s recordsetting sixth , bradley scrambled for seats he came up empty then , by chance , bradley was paired in a proam last week with a man with a connection to the patriots' owner , robert k kraft through his amateur partner , bradley said , he was able to purchase four tickets at face value bradley and his girlfriend will attend the game with the golfer brendan steele and his wife bradley , who has two top25 finishes in three appearances in phoenix , said he and steele had discussed strategies for getting to the game if one or both were in contention for the title with the 14time major champion tiger woods making his first appearance at the tournament since 2001 , traffic in the area is expected to be as congested as the tee box on a drivable par 4 we decided we 'll cross that bridge when we come to it , bradley said he added , none too convincingly , if i ever was going to miss the start of the super bowl , i guess being in one of the final groups , with a chance to win a pga tour event , would be the bestcase scenario the last time the super bowl was held in arizona , in 2008 , brandt snedeker played in one of the final groups on the sunday of the pga tour event after finishing in a tie for ninth , snedeker made it to the stadium with a few minutes to spare there was no traffic , because by that time everybody was already there , said snedeker , who had obtained the tickets through one of his corporate sponsors the winner in 2008 was j b holmes , who defeated in a playoff mickelson had acquired two tickets to the super bowl game between the patriots and the giants but even before having to go overtime , mickelson had decided the double was not doable at the start of the day , he handed the tickets to his caddie , jim mackay , and told him , it s your job to give these tickets away mackay , whose secondfavorite nfl team after his hometown arizona cardinals is the giants , looked for a youngster wearing a cap with the logo of callaway , one of mickelson s sponsors on the third tee , he found one he approached drew fockler , who was standing next to his father , john , and asked them if they liked football when they replied enthusiastically , he reached into mickelson s bag , pulled out the tickets and asked them if they would like to attend the super bowl the focklers happily accepted the tickets they later sent mickelson a thankyou note mickelson has no plans to attend sunday s game describing the super bowl as a life experience , he said it was something i 've enjoyed doing a few times , probably three or four but it is a lot of effort to go there , and i do n't have that strong desire now that i 've done it a number of times i will later with my kids or sooner , if his hometown team , the san diego chargers , returns to the big game for the first time since losing to the san francisco 49ers in 1995 or that , mickelson said with a laugh
washington a cascade of events suggests that 2015 could be remembered as a liberal spring the moment when deeply divisive and consuming questions of race , sexuality and broadened access to health care were settled in quick succession , and social tolerance was cemented as a cornerstone of american public life yet what appears , in headlines and celebrations across the country , to represent an unalloyed victory for democrats , in which lawmakers and judges alike seemed to give in to the leftward shift of public opinion , may contain an opening for the to move beyond losing battles and seemingly lost causes conservatives have , in short order , endured a series of setbacks on ideas that , for some on the right , are definitional that marriage is between a man and a woman , that southern heritage and its symbols are to be unambivalently revered and that the federal government should play a limited role in the lives of americans remarkably , some of these verities have been challenged not by liberals but by from the right the past week and the month that preceded it have been nothing short of a rout in the culture wars bruce jenner , the famed olympian , in the most prominent moment yet for transgender people the killings of in charleston , sc , at once rendered unsuitable for governmentsanctioned display and friday s of nationwide elevated a community that had been consigned to the shadows for centuries of american life but even as conservatives appear under siege , some republicans predict that this moment will be remembered as an effective wiping of the slate before the nation begins focusing in earnest on the presidential race as important as some of these issues may be to the most conservative elements of the party s base and in the primaries ahead , few republican leaders want to contest the 2016 elections on social or cultural grounds , where polls suggest that they are sharply out of step with the american public every once in a while , we bring down the curtain on the politics of a prior era , said david frum , the conservative writer the stage is now cleared for the next generation of issues and republicans can say , whether you 're gay , black or a recent migrant to our country , we are going to welcome you as a fully cherished member of our coalition' the critical question is whether the republican party will embrace such a message in order to seize what many party officials see as an opening to turn the election toward economic and national security issues it will not happen easily every major republican presidential candidate the s ruling on friday affirming samesex marriage as the law of the land of course , many of the republicans running for president are keen to move on from the culture wars , but others , like and senator ted cruz of texas , are already seizing on matters like samesex marriage and what they call judicial overreach to distinguish themselves in a crowded primary field and the conservative activists and interest groups that play an important role in the primary will not let any of the candidates simply move on our candidates running in a primary are put in a little bit of a box by the events of this week , but at the same time , it does change the landscape for the general election , which is a blessing , said carl forti , a republican strategist who has worked on presidential races i'm glad i'm not on a campaign and do n't have to advise my candidate on how to navigate those three issues this week , because the answers for the primary and the general are radically different privately , some of the strategists advising republican hopefuls believe the last week has been nothing short of a gift from above a great unburdening on issues of race and sexuality , and a disaster averted rhetorical opposition to the affordable care act will still be de rigueur in the primaries , but litigating the issue in theory is wholly different from doing so with more than six million people deprived of their health insurance collectively , this optimistic thinking would have it , june will go down as the month that dulled some of the wedge issues democrats were hoping to wield next year whether the presidential candidates agree or disagree with the results of all this , it allows them to say these issues have been settled and move on to things that offer more of a political homefield advantage , said tim pawlenty , the former republican governor of minnesota while acknowledging that the country has become more tolerant and , in some ways , culturally liberal , many republicans contend that america is still receptive to a more conservative approach on economics and national security after all , the same week that highlighted the ascent of cultural liberalism also illustrated the limitations of economic populism , as organized labor was unable to block a measure giving president obama  there will always be side issues , but none of that will compete with people s primary concerns , which are the economy and who is going to be able to keep the country safe , said whit ayres , a republican pollster advising senator marco rubio of florida yet as the 2012 presidential race demonstrated , the immediate demands of a republican primary can outweigh the eventual priorities of a general election and , given last week s events , conservative hardliners in the coming republican contest will be even hungrier for candidates to demonstrate that they are willing to employ all possible means to repel what they see as an assault on foundational values we have been observing the deconstructing of america in the last six and a half years , said tony perkins , the head of the conservative family research council the tolerance level has been exceeded what outrages social conservatives is not only the narrow issue of samesex marriage rights , but also what they see as a violation of religious liberties that they believe are intrinsic to the country when senator cruz said the past week had featured some of the darkest 24 hours in our history , he spoke for those conservatives who believe the america they know is slipping away what is unclear about the wide republican field is whether a candidate has yet surfaced who is deft enough to appeal to such devoted conservatives without going so far to mollify them as to scare away less dogmatic voters of the wellfinanced candidates , jeb bush has done the most , on matters of race and marriage , to portray himself as a candidate who can appeal to a more socially tolerant country gov scott walker of wisconsin , who made his name on fiscal issues , has surprised some in the party by positioning himself on the right on cultural issues mr rubio has been more cautious , trying not to inflame primary voters while also speaking in a measured fashion to avoid harming himself if he is the nominee yet even if the party s eventual standardbearer can win the nomination without providing much fodder for democrats to use in the general election , he or she will not be able to ignore cultural issues entirely selfidentified white evangelical voters can make up as much as 40 percent of a republican presidential nominee s vote that is what worries many of the party s strategists some of our candidates will play to them and take positions that are n't helpful in a general election , mr forti said and while a window may be open for republicans to shift the race in a different direction , democrats will do their best to keep the focus on subjects many republican candidates want to avoid many of them , hillary rodham clinton told democrats on friday night in virginia , appear determined to lead us right back into the past
first they conquered the world and then on friday , the members of the united states women s soccer team took over manhattan actually , lower manhattan , to be more precise , where the players were honored with a traditional tickertape parade up broadway five days after they captured the world cup with an emphatic 52 victory over japan it was the first time a women s team had been honored in such a fashion , making it a landmark moment in this country for women s sports and for soccer there were , not surprisingly , plenty of girls in the crowds that lined the parade route there were , not surprisingly , plenty of american flags riding on the lead float and brandishing the world cup trophy was the irrepressible megan rapinoe riding with her was carli lloyd , who scored three goals in the first 16 minutes of the championship game , and the team s coach , jill ellis \( oh , yeah mayor bill de blasio was on the float , too \) as the parade slowly worked its way toward city hall , amid the improvised ticker tape of a technological age , the players snapped photos and sent out twitter posts expressing their gratitude and joy at what was occurring never in my wildest dreams could i have imagined something like that , kelley o'hara wrote thank you nyc i love my country , alex morgan chimed in in a ceremony at city hall , the players were introduced one by one , with christie rampone , who turned 40 last month and is the senior member of the team , being saved for last as rampone held the world cup trophy aloft at the front of the stage , her teammates joined her and broke out some dance steps , not exactly the custom at previous parades honoring teams like the yankees and then several players addressed the crowd none of us stopped believing , and neither should you guys , said we love you , new york city well , i'm a jersey girl , a philly fan , but new york city , you 're awesome , said lloyd , who hails from delran , nj having this parade here in new york city was one of the best moments in my entire life along the parade route , gerson guzman had held up a sign identifying his 2yearold daughter , andrea , as rapinoe s youngest fan he said that he was very happy to see the women get their welldeserved parade and that it was time for the united states men s team to step it up that team might , but winning the men s world cup in 2018 , in russia , is probably beyond its reach but then the united states women get another shot in 2019 , in france so keep that confetti handy
one of the oldest traditions in organized sport appears right at the top of the pitching the first wicket is to be determined by the toss of a piece of money so was born the pregame coin toss but time moves on though , in cricket , often slowly after 272 years , english county cricket will do away with the coin toss in many games starting next season coins are tossed in lots of sports , though the result is not usually crucial in football , for example , the advantage of winning the pregame toss and receiving the ball first is mostly negated by the other team s receiving the ball to start the second half still , a surprising amount of coin toss lore has built up over the years on thanksgiving 1998 , a steelerslions game went to overtime , and the pittsburgh captain , jerome bettis , seemed to call tails but the referee , and awarded detroit the ball three minutes later , the lions kicked the winning field goal the blunder led to a change in procedure players began calling heads or tails before the coin was in the air and the feeling that the result of the overtime toss was too important led to a new rule in 2010 that a field goal on the first overtime drive would not immediately end the game on a snowy day in philadelphia in 2013 , the coin and had to be retossed predraft coin tosses have changed the course of sports history the portland trail blazers' in 1984 gave the first pick of the draft , hakeem olajuwon \( then known as akeem \) , to the rockets a coin toss is also the tiebreaker of last resort in many competitions at the 2000 women s gold cup soccer tournament , the united states and brazil wound up dead even , with each having two wins , one draw , 19 goals for and none against the united states and was awarded first place in its group in the men s edition the same year , canada to qualify for the quarterfinals and then went on to win in cricket , more than most sports , the toss can be vital the pitch , the grassy area where the ball is bowled , can change as the game goes along and because the team batting second may not get its chance for a day or more , it can face drastically different conditions even when a team wins the toss , the wrong decision by the captain can doom it almost before a ball is bowled in the 2002 ashes in brisbane , australia , the england captain , nasser hussain , won the toss but decided to bowl australia happily batted , and won the match by 384 the home team s groundskeeper can also have a great effect on the pitch , preparing it to best suit his team s bowlers cricket officials in england are concerned that home teams have fallen into the habit of setting up their pitches to favor certain bowlers , perhaps by making the grass damp in particular , counties seem to be setting up their pitches to favor gardenvariety bowlers who bowl fast , but not too fast these bowlers are known as medium pacers , or derisively as dibblydobbly bowlers the pitches are a real problem , andy flower , a former england cricket coach , spin bowlers do n't develop because the medium pacers bowl their overs and batsmen are not exposed to quality spin but when you get to international cricket , the pitches are completely different , and the qualities that proved successful in county cricket will be of little use dibblydobbly bowlers are not going to win you test matches under the new rules , the visiting team will always have the option to bowl first should it decline , there would still be a coin toss officials hope that will encourage home teams , knowing that the visitors can always choose to bowl first , to set up higherquality pitches that favor batsmen more they also think the change will help develop spin bowlers , who are crucial to the success of the england team in spinfriendly countries like india another benefit will be giving a small edge to the visiting team that would reduce the fairly large homefield advantage in cricket cricket traditionalists , who tend to be far more traditional than most , are upset please do n't scrap the coin toss from cricket , plaintively , and politely , urged before the decision was final andrew gale , the captain of yorkshire , also disapproved so no coin toss next year if away team does n't want it \? ! he posted on twitter last week , adding that the change was absolute madness but the march of progress never stops perhaps cricket will soon be ready for another seismic change expect one by around 2288
for more than a year , members of congress have been doing about the need to broadly reform harsh federal sentencing laws , which are a central factor in the explosion of the federal prison population it s an overdue conversation , and one of the few in which democrats and republicans but , so far , they have nothing to show for it in the last session , senators introduced three bipartisan bills two proposed front end reforms , like reducing or eliminating ridiculously long mandatory minimum sentences for some drug crimes the other focused on back end fixes , like increasing opportunities for goodtime credit to allow certain prisoners early release none of the bills , but it was encouraging to see all three reintroduced in the new republicanled senate at least it was until they ran into a roadblock in the shape of senator charles grassley , republican of iowa mr grassley , the chairman of the judiciary committee , wields great power over any sentencing legislation his predecessor , senator patrick leahy , democrat of vermont , is a cosponsor of , which would allow judges to ignore mandatory minimum sentences in certain circumstances but mr grassley , for reasons that defy basic fairness and empirical data , has remained an opponent of almost any reduction of those sentences in a from the senate floor this month , he called the bills lenient and , frankly , dangerous , and he raised the specter of highlevel drug traffickers spilling onto the streets mr grassley is as mistaken as he is powerful mandatory minimums to punish many lowerlevel offenders who were not their intended targets meanwhile , the persistent fantasy that locking up more people leads to less crime continues to be debunked states from have reduced prison populations and crime rates at the same time a released last week by the brennan center for justice found that since 2000 putting more people behind bars has had essentially no effect on the national crime rate the bill that appears to have the best chance of passing anytime soon is known as the that s actually a sprawling acronym for corrections oversight , recidivism reduction , and eliminating costs for taxpayers in our national system cosponsored by senator john cornyn , republican of texas , and senator sheldon whitehouse , democrat of rhode island , the bill s name is more ambitious than its goals , which include giving a narrow group of inmates the chance to participate in educational and other programs in exchange for earlier release \( the bill authorizes no financing for these programs , relying instead on , among other things , the volunteer efforts of faithbased groups \) rehabilitation is a laudable aim , and it should be a part of any sentencing reform package but the cornynwhitehouse bill would exclude nearly half of all federal prisoners in many cases without any evidence that they pose a greater risk to public safety the bill also relies on an inmate s criminal history this is a legitimate measure when it is used with the awareness that law enforcement disproportionately targets minorities the danger is that whitecollar prisoners , who are most often white , will receive the law s benefits , while , say , drug offenders , who are disproportionately africanamerican , will be left out finally , the bill pushes the use of databased riskassessment tools , which sound smart but again because they rely on factors like a person s employment history , neighborhood and education level often  obviously , any meaningful reform must include both significant reductions in sentences and backend measures that do not unfairly exclude certain groups for now , the sixterm mr grassley may obstruct progress toward that goal , but the newer generation of lawmakers , republican and democratic , are more creative and forwardlooking , and have drawn many of their lessons from successes they have seen at the state level sentencing reform is a big and complicated issue , and may take some time to get right it would be a mistake to pass an incomplete bill and pretend that the hard work of reform is done
last week , a zombie went to new hampshire and staked its claim to the republican presidential nomination well , ok , it was actually gov chris christie of new jersey but it s pretty much the same thing you see , in which he tried to position himself as a toughminded fiscal realist in fact , however , his supposedly toughminded policy idea was a classic zombie an idea that should have died long ago in the face of evidence that undermines its basic premise , but somehow just keeps shambling along but let us not be too harsh on mr christie a deep attachment to longrefuted ideas seems to be required of all prominent republicans whoever finally gets the nomination for 2016 will have multiple zombies as his running mates start with mr christie , who thought he was being smart and brave by proposing that we raise the age of eligibility for both social security and medicare to 69 does n't this make sense now that americans are living longer \? no , it does n't this whole line of argument should have died in 2007 , when the social security administration issued a report showing that almost all has taken place among the affluent the bottom half of workers , who are precisely the americans who rely on social security most , have seen their life expectancy at age 65 rise only a bit more than a year since the 1970s furthermore , while lawyers and politicians may consider working into their late 60s no hardship , things look somewhat different to ordinary workers , many of whom still have to perform manual labor and while raising the retirement age would impose a great deal of hardship , it would save remarkably little money in fact , found that raising the medicare age would save almost no money at all but mr christie , who quickly echoed his proposal evidently knows none of this the zombie ideas have eaten his brain and there are plenty of other zombies out there consider , for example , the zombification of the debate over health reform before the affordable care act went fully into effect , conservatives made a series of dire predictions about what would happen when it did it would actually it would lead to , as premiums soared it would cost the government far more than projected , and blow up the deficit it would be a huge jobdestroyer in reality , the act has produced  than in the years before reform and 2014 , the first year of full implementation , also had  so how has this changed the discourse \? on the right , not at all as far as i can tell , every prominent republican talks about obamacare as if all the predicted disasters have , in fact , come to pass finally , one of the interesting political developments of this election cycle has been the triumphant return of voodoo economics , the supplyside claim that tax cuts for the rich stimulate the economy so much that they pay for themselves in the real world , this doctrine has an unblemished record of failure despite confident rightwing predictions of doom , neither the clinton tax increase of 1993 nor the obama tax increase of 2013 killed the economy \( far from it \) , while the bush boom that followed the tax cuts of 2001 and 2003 was unimpressive even before it ended in financial crisis kansas , whose governor promised , has failed even to match the growth of neighboring states in the world of republican politics , however , voodoo s grip has never been stronger wouldbe presidential candidates must audition in front of prominent supplysiders to prove their fealty to failed doctrine tax proposals like marco rubio s would create a giant hole in the budget , then claim that this hole would be filled by a miraculous economic upsurge supplyside economics , it s now clear , is the ultimate zombie no amount of evidence or logic can kill it so why has the republican party experienced a zombie apocalypse \? one reason , surely , is the fact that most republican politicians represent states or districts that will never , ever vote for a democrat , so the only thing they fear is a challenge from the far right another is the need to tell big money what it wants to hear a candidate saying anything realistic about obamacare or tax cuts wo n't survive the sheldon adelson koch brothers primary whatever the reasons , the result is clear pundits will try to pretend that we 're having a serious policy debate , but , as far as issues go , 2016 is already set up to be the election of the living dead
buenos aires election season in is heralded by images of smiling candidates , gazing down from billboards and up from fliers distributed by zealous volunteers many names strike a familiar chord with voters , but this year an unfamiliar face suddenly materialized , drawing millions of eyes omar obaca who knows , he might turn out to be another obama , said laura buccafusca , 67 , a wellcoiffured retiree who was walking her dog in the congreso area , reflecting on the american president s relatively high popularity here but omar obaca has no chance of winning indeed , he is not even running he is a fictitious africanargentine candidate , dreamed up by an advertising company to satirize argentine , and perhaps american , politics , and setting off a whirlwind in the process the comedy campaign has exploded into an internet sensation , channeling a desire for change after more than a decade of onefamily rule and igniting a fierce debate here over the ways in which black people are portrayed in a society that has long prioritized its ties to europe the billboards advertise an online video series that has drawn more than seven million views some of the episodes showcase farcical policies like everyone dressed as police to reduce street crime paying s to china with caramel candy or rigging the weak argentine peso to a fantastically strong exchange rate of four american dollars obaca is the politician that all politicians want to be , but they ca n't because they do n't have ideas and they 're not black , said sebasti n rodas , a director at nah ! contenidos , the advertising company behind the project we 're making fun of the idea that someone can use their color to market themselves in a political campaign he has proposals , but the first thing is i'm black , i look like obama maybe that s good vote for me ! ' some argentines of african origin have expressed excitement at seeing one of their own in the limelight it gives me hope to see an afrodescendent as protagonist this is the first time an afro actor has had a mass audience , said paulo da silva , 27 , an africanargentine actor whose family left brazil for buenos aires when he was 3 for every 10 roles that exist for a white person , there is one for a black person but some leading activists counter that obaca revives old stereotypes the newspaper pagina 12 recently published a scathing oped that accused the campaign of resorting to one of the oldest traditions of aristocratic families of yesteryear the black buffoon its author , federico pita , president of the african diaspora of argentina , wrote that naturalization of racism and white supremacy had allowed a character who ridicules , stereotypes , stigmatizes to gain huge popularity carlos lvarez , president of a group called agrupaci n xang , said that community members had filed a complaint with the national institute against discrimination , xenophobia and racism he called obaca a vulgar stereotype of a happy black guy to liven up the party , exemplifying structural racism the advertisers at nah , who are generally dismissive of criticism of the campaign , said they were fascinated by the campaign that swept mr obama to victory in 2008 , including its groundbreaking social media strategy political marketing is totally fake , but the first obama campaign was very genuine , mr rodas said they did n't fear doing things differently the actor who plays mr obaca , marcos moreno mart nez , grins and radiates an easy charisma , talking in local slang with emphatic hand gestures that evoke his theatrical background he got the call for what he described as just another casting in 2010 and was instantly selected for a pilot episode , filmed on the spot nah had intended to produce the obaca series for elections in 2011 , but no buyers emerged until the online channel fwtv came forward last year months later , mr mart nez , 38 , said he felt like a star every time he stepped onto the streets of buenos aires , as steady streams of fans request selfies by his side it never ceases to surprise me , the actor said kids in other provinces see me , even when i'm not dressed as obaca , and say , what a genius , i 'll vote for you ! ' he was previously known for playing an inmate in tumberos , a successful tv drama about corruption and prison life during tough times after argentina s 2001 financial crisis that led to film and theater roles , but mr mart nez needed more income like some other struggling actors , he worked as a taxi driver for several years , before selling his car to invest in materials to build a small house that he now rents out he lives in the provincial city of luj n , about 42 miles from buenos aires nobody ever gave me anything , he said , recalling the years of crushing threehour commutes from his home into the capital , where he attended theater classes as a university student as well as acting , he plays percussion in a latin dance band and runs music workshops at a school in his neighborhood obaca arrived at a moment with a lot of political violence , mr mart nez said , describing a polarized atmosphere that breeds social tension people needed to laugh at a fictional politician who promises an argentina that will not happen , he added that s why they get on board with the obaca dream on sunday , national elections will bring an official end to 12 years of kirchnerism , the political movement named for the late president , n stor kirchner , who was married to and succeeded by the incumbent ,  after winning fouryear terms in 2007 and 2011 , she is constitutionally barred from seeking a third consecutive term although some in argentina say the country is ready for a political shift , continuity is expected the frontrunner , daniel scioli , is a former vice president who has been governor of buenos aires province since 2007 and was endorsed by mrs kirchner none of the candidates has been able to generate a perception of something new , said philip kitzberger , a professor of political science at torcuato di tella university but critics contend the obaca campaign comes at the expense of argentina s small black population argentina s 2010 census reported that about 150 , 000 \( or just 04 percent \) of its 40 million people considered themselves afrodescendent an ethnic category that was reinstated after more than 130 years of not appearing on the survey erika edwards , an assistant professor of latin american history at the university of north carolina in charlotte , said that such a tiny number was probably an underestimate argentina s first census showed that blacks made up about a third of the population in the late 18th century , with most arriving as african slaves but a huge european immigration , specifically called for by the first argentine laws , shifted the country s demographics miscegenation and racial mixing were actually encouraged under the guise of blanqueamiento' the concerted whitening of the nation , dr edwards said in the mid19th century , domingo faustino sarmiento , revered as the father of education in modern argentina , announced the extinction of africanargentines at a time when the black community still published its own newspapers in buenos aires despite such assessments , africanargentines like jos agust n ferreyra , a prolific filmmaker , and oscar alem n , a versatile musician who played jazz with louis armstrong , gained recognition in their fields but africanargentines still say such accomplishments are neglected mr mart nez defended his character in the obaca campaign , contending that there were much worse things than a black politician in a suit who is broadly admired i was asked to play delinquents , thieves or drug dealers so many times that one day i decided to never accept that again , he said
sergiy stakhovsky , who plays his thirdround match friday at the against jowilfried tsonga , has spent a week in restrained silence or as close as stakhovsky can get to silence stakhovsky , a 29yearold ukrainian ranked 60th , has been long known as one of the most outspoken players on the atp tour for his insistence that men deserve more prize money than women , among other issues he is an elected member of the atp player council , and during its pretournament meeting last friday , stakhovsky posted his frustration on twitter at a newly proposed rule that would make players more liable to penalties for offthecourt comments looks like it s my last honest tweet since the is implementing censorship rule , he wrote the proposed rule , which has to be voted on by the atp boards , would reaffirm the atp s jurisdiction to punish players for comments deemed detrimental to the sport in an interview thursday after his firstround doubles victory , stakhovsky said he felt he spurred the rule change because the atp felt powerless to punish him for statements he made during wimbledon that drew criticism for perceived homophobia the atp initially said it was investigating the matter but has not issued stakhovsky any punishment they realized that they did nothing to me , stakhovsky said so that s why the rules changed stakhovsky drew ire for comments he made to the ukrainian website , in which he expressed his confidence that there were no gay men among the top 100 players in the atp tour you see , on the atp we have a normal atmosphere , he said , according to if there was anything , we 'd know about it , because it s a very closed circle earlier there used to be talk about gasquet , about nadal even about federer i wo n't sacrifice my hand for the whole tour and the new guys , who are just joining , but in the backbone of the top 100 there are definitely no gays he rebuked martina navratilova , a lesbian and a gay rights advocate , for her assertion that there definitely are gay male players in tennis and then pointed to what he considers rampant lesbianism in women s tennis on the wta tour , almost every other player is a lesbian , he said can you imagine half of them ! so i for sure wo n't send my daughter to play tennis eric butorac , president of the players' council , said that stakhovsky s remarks concerned the council and that he called each of the 10 members to discuss possible actions none of us were happy with what he said , and we had to formally discuss where we saw him fitting in with our player council in the future , butorac said after a lot of deliberation and differing opinions , we decided we were going to keep him on the council butorac , who is in his first year on the council , said he regretted not issuing a statement condemning stakhovsky s statements , as the council later did after nick kyrgios s disparaging comments to stan wawrinka during a match a month later this is also me learning on the job and deciding what our role is as the player council , butorac said it was a lot of explaining to sergiy that even though this was just his personal opinions , when you do represent something like the atp , whatever you say , you 're held accountable for he is a good guy he just gets a little looselipped , and that was a pretty horrible comment on thursday , stakhovsky said his wish for his daughter not to play tennis was not in regard to the demographics of the women s game my daughter and my wish for her not to play tennis has nothing to do with that there is a certain vibe around the wta , he said rather , he said , he was referring to not wanting to subject his daughter to the rigors of the professional tour , which requires grueling travel i do n't want such a life for my daughter , he said while he insisted on that clarification , stakhovsky did not back down from his previous comments about gay players in tennis at the moment right now , it s kind of nonsense to say that there are if we 're not aware of it , he said we 're spending a lot of time together in the same locker room , and you kind of have a feel if somebody is or somebody is not despite his declarations , stakhovsky said that a gay player would be permitted to come out by his peers and defended his own sense of tolerance my best friend is homosexual , stakhovsky said my hairdresser is homosexual i have zero problems with homosexuals stakhovsky took particular issue with remarks made by the retired player james blake , who is a representative of the progay group athlete ally as a former atp player and father of two amazing daughters , i would be thrilled if they followed in the footsteps of inspirational greats like martina navratilova and billie jean king , blake wrote stakhovsky s comments are out of line , out of touch , and stand in opposition to the values that tennis taught me and stakhovsky is kidding himself if he believes there are no gay tennis players in the top 100 i hope that if any players inside or outside the top 100 decide to come out , they will be welcomed and supported stakhovsky said he deserved rebuke only if and when he was proved to be incorrect about there being no gay players in the top 100

vienna absent real pronouncements 11 days after the hardandfast deadline for a nuclear deal with , people have begun looking to the balconies to determine if a deal is imminent well , one balcony mohammad javad zarif s , iran s foreign minister , who on saturday spent a lot of time in the sun as the diplomacy churned on , mr zarif was reading through what appeared to be a draft agreement 20 pages , with 80 pages or so of annexes and allowed himself to smile broadly i think we 'll stay in vienna until the end of sunday we 're negotiating hard , mr zarif was quoted as saying by an iranian reporter in response to a shouted question missing were the pointed accusations of a few days back that the united states was reneging on past pledges , or opening new issues then there is mr kerry himself , uncharacteristically sphinxlike in his public pronouncements , occasionally appearing outside the hotel , laying his crutches against a small table , and declaring , repeatedly , that while talks were serious , the iranians needed to make some fundamental political decisions mr kerry expressed caution in a after a saturday morning meeting with mr zarif , writing of some difficult issues to resolve but mr kerry had nothing to say saturday evening after what appeared to be a potentially pivotal session with his iranian counterpart now that everything is on the table , the moment has come to decide , laurent fabius , the french foreign minister , said in a statement to reuters for anyone seeking diplomatic tea leaves , there were others on saturday iran s supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei spoke to students in tehran , but did not lay down new red lines as he did a few weeks ago , when he talked about how no foreigners , inspectors included , would be allowed into military bases mr zarif and his team have been walking that back delicately directly contradicting the supreme leader can be a poor career decision by saying that under an accord with the international atomic energy agency that iran will implement , there is precedent for managed access to some sensitive military sites where there may be evidence of suspected nuclear activity the ayatollah s only warning to the students was that the struggle with the arrogant power does not end after a deal there was no doubt about which arrogant power he had in mind but the implicit assumption that a deal was underway seemed another part of his effort to signal to the iranian revolutionary guard corps and other hardliners in iran that a deal could well happen soon and so they must find other areas , at least for a while , to pursue their antiarrogantpower strategy on saturday evening , after foreign ministers from france and britain flew in , mr kerry met with all of his negotiating partners , presumably to review how the deal was shaping up , and what lastminute hitches needed to be worked through none of this body language assures there will not be a lastminute hitch in 18 months of negotiating , there have been more turns than in the vienna classic the third man , which is screened regularly here , a reminder of another era when the city was better known for intrigue than diplomacy but for the first time , the iranians , the americans and the europeans are all talking about endgames republicans running for the presidential nomination have been lambasting mr kerry for wanting a deal too much , and even some democrats , meeting president obama at a white house social gathering this past week , said they would not vote for it unless they understood all sections , even those kept secret but whatever the result , it is hard to watch the secretary of state without regarding him as an ironman in a negotiation that has tested his formidable endurance saturday was mr kerry s 15th consecutive day at the talks , the most time he has ever continuously spent in one foreign destination since arriving at the state department perhaps more significant , it is longer than he spent in the hospital after the bicycle accident that fractured his leg he intersperses the negotiations with physical therapy , and some afternoons he takes a break so that his motorcade can return him to the imperial hotel a vienna landmark that has hosted many presidents and secretaries of state though the hotel does not advertise it , hitler stayed there in 1938 , returning to the city where he had been a day laborer mr kerry has held more than 50 meetings here , many with mr zarif , but at some of them trying to keep russia and china on board henry kissinger spent more time on shuttle diplomacy , but he did not spend more time in one place in lausanne , switzerland , where the framework for these negotiations was reached in early april , the reporters whose news organizations were willing to foot hefty bills stayed in the beau rivage hotel , often in rooms next to the negotiators it made for easy reporting , perhaps too easy in the minds of the american and european officials , as well as the iranians , who all want to maintain the sanctity of the negotiating room in vienna , it is a very different story the coburg palace , where basement foundations show evidence of the last battles against the ottoman empire in 1683 , has been as successful in repelling reporters as it was in repelling the turks many journalists are working from an adjacent tent , where they are offered austrian chocolates and ice cream in lieu of real information many have escaped the tent to camp out in the lobby of the marriott hotel , just across from the palace , where they have consumed prodigious amounts of m lange , an espressobased viennese coffee specialty but wander a few blocks away , to the cathedral that dominates the city , or mozart s house or the many places beethoven lived he had a hard time making the rent and tourists are largely tuned out to the drama playing out a few blocks away
quintanilla good evening , i'm carl quintanilla , with my colleagues becky quick and john harwood we 'll be joined tonight by some of cnbc s top experts on the markets and personal finance quintanilla let s get through the rules of the road candidates get 30 seconds to answer the opening question , 60 seconds to answer a formal question , 30 seconds for followups and rebuttals , all at the discretion of the moderators we want you to weigh in from home you 'll see your tweets at the bottom of the screen use the hashtag , cnbcgopdebate you can also go to cnbccom vote to tell us where you stand throughout the night so let s introduce the candidates for tonight s republican presidential debate on the stage from left to right , governor john kasich \( applause \) governor mike huckabee \( applause \) governor jeb bush \( applause \) senator marco rubio \( applause \) mr donald trump \( applause \) dr ben carson \( applause \) mrs carly fiorina \( applause \) senator ted cruz \( applause \) governor chris christie \( applause \) and senator rand paul \( applause \) a lot to get to tonight so let s get started this first is an open question this series of debates is essentially a job interview with the american people and in any job interview , you know this you get asked , what s your biggest weakness \? so in 30 seconds , without telling us that you try too hard or that you 're a perfectionist \( laughter \) what is your biggest weakness and what are you doing to address it \? we 'll go left to right governor kasich , 30 seconds kasich good question , but i want to tell you , my great concern is that we are on the verge , perhaps , of picking someone who cannot do this job i 've watched to see people say that we should dismantle medicare and medicaid and leave the senior citizens out out in the in the cold i 've heard them talk about deporting 10 or 11 people here from this country out of this country , splitting families i 've heard about tax schemes that do n't add up , that put our kids in in a deeper hole than they are today we need somebody who can lead we need somebody who can balance budgets , cut taxes quintanilla governor \? kasich you know , frankly , i did it in washington , in ohio , and i will do it again in washington , if i'm president , to get this country moving again kasich country moving again quintanilla governor huckabee huckabee well , john , i do n't really have any weaknesses that i can think of \( laughter \) but my wife is down here in the front , and i'm sure , if you 'd like to talk to her later , she can give you more than you 'll ever be able to take care of if i have a weakness , it s that i try to live by the rules i try to live by the rules , no matter what they are , and i was brought up that way as a kid play by the rules and i 'll tell you what a weakness is of this country there are a lot of people who are sick and tired because washington does not play by the same rules that the american people have to play by quintanilla thank you , governor governor bush bush you know , i am by my nature impatient and this is not an endeavor that rewards that you gotta be patient you gotta be stick with it , and all that but also , i ca n't fake anger i believe this is still the most extraordinary country on the face of the earth and it troubles me that people are rewarded for tearing down our country it s never been that way in american politics before bush i ca n't do it i just do n't believe that this country s days are going to be deeply you know , going down i think we 're on the verge of the greatest time , and i want to fix the things to let people rise up quintanilla senator rubio rubio thank you for that question i would begin by saying that i'm not sure it s a weakness , but i do believe that i share a sense of optimism for america s future that , today , is eroding from too many of our people i think there s a sense in this country today that somehow our best days are behind us and that does n't have to be true our greatest days lie ahead if we are willing to do what it takes now if we 're willing to do what it takes now , the 21st century is going to be the new american century , greater than any other era we 've had in the history of this great nation quintanilla mr trump \? trump i think maybe my greatest weakness is that i trust people too much i'm too trusting and when they let me down , if they let me down , i never forgive i find it very , very hard to forgive people that deceived me so i do n't know if you would call that a weakness , but my wife said let up \( laughter \) quintanilla dr carson \? carson probably in terms of the applying for the job of president , a weakness would be not really seeing myself in that position until hundreds of thousands of people began to tell me that i needed to do it i do , however , believe in reagan s 11th commandment , and will not be engaging in awful things about my compatriots here and recognizing that it s so important , this election , because we 're talking about america for the people versus america for the government quintanilla mrs fiorina \? fiorina well , gee , after the last debate , i was told that i did n't smile enough \( laughter \) quintanilla fixed it fiorina but i also think that these are very serious times 75 percent of the american people think the federal government is corrupt i agree with them and this big powerful , corrupt bureaucracy works now only for the big , the powerful , the wealthy and the wellconnected meantime , wages have stagnated for 40 years we have more americans out of work or just americans who quit looking for work for 40 years ours was intended to be a citizen government this is about more than replacing a d with an r we need a leader who will help us take our government back quintanilla senator cruz \? cruz i'm too agreeable , easy going \( laughter \) you know , i think my biggest weakness is exactly the opposite i'm a fighter i am passionate about what i believe i 've been passionate my whole life about the constitution and , you know , for sixandahalf years , we 've had a gigantic party if you want someone to grab a beer with , i may not be that guy but if you want someone to drive you home , i will get the job done and i will get you home quintanilla governor christie \? christie i do n't see a lot of weakness on this stage , quite frankly where i see the weakness is in those three people that are left on the democratic stage you know , i see a socialist , an isolationist and a pessimist and for the sake of me , i ca n't figure out which one is which \( laughter \) but i will but i will tell you this , the socialist says they 're going to pay for everything and give you everything for free , except they do n't say they 're going to raise it through taxes to 90 percent to do it the isolationist is the one who wants to continue to follow a foreign policy that has fewer democracies today than when barack obama came into office around the world but i know who the pessimist is it s hillary clinton and you put me on that stage against her next september , she wo n't get within 10 miles of the white house take it to the bank quintanilla senator paul \? paul you know , i left my medical practice and ran for office because i was concerned about an 18 trillion debt we borrow a million dollars a minute now , on the floor of the congress , the washington establishment from both parties puts forward a bill that will explode the deficit it allows president obama to borrow unlimited amounts of money i will stand firm i will spend every ounce of energy to stop it i will begin tomorrow to filibuster it and i ask everyone in america to call congress tomorrow and say enough is enough no more debt quintanilla thanks to all the candidates john \? harwood mr trump , you 've done very well in this campaign so far by promising to build a wall and make another country pay for it trump right harwood send 11 million people out of the country cut taxes 10 trillion without increasing the deficit trump right harwood and make americans better off because your greatness would replace the stupidity and incompetence of others trump that s right harwood let s be honest \( laughter \) is this a comic book version of a presidential campaign \? trump no , not a comic book , and it s not a very nicely asked question the way you say that larry kudlow is an example , who i have a lot of respect for , who loves my tax plan we 're reducing taxes to 15 percent we 're bringing corporate taxes down , bringing money back in , corporate inversions we have 25 trillion outside of the united states which we want to bring back in as far as the wall is concerned , we 're going to build a wall we 're going to create a border we 're going to let people in , but they 're going to come in legally they 're going to come in legally and it s something that can be done , and i get questioned about that they built the great wall of china that s 13 , 000 miles here , we actually need 1 , 000 because we have natural barriers so we need 1 , 000 trump we can do a wall we 're going to have a big , fat beautiful door right in the middle of the wall we 're going to have people come in , but they 're coming in legally and mexico s going to pay for the wall because mexico i love the mexican people i respect the mexican leaders but the leaders are much sharper , smarter and more cunning than our leaders and just to finish , people say , how will you get mexico to pay \? a politician other than the people in the states i do n't want to a politician cannot get them to pay i can we lose , we have a trade imbalance excuse me , john of 50 billion harwood we 're at the 60 seconds trump believe me the world is peanuts by comparison harwood we 're at 60 seconds , but i gotta ask you , you talked about your tax plan you say that it would not increase the deficit because you cut taxes 10 trillion in the economy would take off like \( crosstalk \) harwood hold on , hold on the economy would take off like a rocket ship trump right dynamically harwood i talked to economic advisers who have served presidents of both parties they said that you have as chance of cutting taxes that much without increasing the deficit as you would of flying away from that podium by flapping your arms trump then you have to get rid of larry kudlow , who sits on your panel , who s a great guy , who came out the other day and said , i love trump s tax plan \( crosstalk \) harwood the tax foundation says has looked at all of our plans and and his creates , even with the dynamic effect , 8 trillion dollar deficit quick gentlemen we 'll we 'll get back to this just a minute just a minute we 're gonna continue this i wanna talk taxes quintanilla hold it we 'll cut it back to you in just a minute becky s moving on quick dr carson , let s talk about taxes you have a flat tax plan of 10 percent flat taxes , and i 've looked at it and this is something that is very appealing to a lot of voters , but i 've had a really tough time trying to make the math work on this if you were to took a 10 percent tax , with the numbers right now in total personal income , you 're gonna come in with bring in 15 trillion that is less than half of what we bring in right now and by the way , it s gonna leave us in a 2 trillion hole so what analysis got you to the point where you think this will work \? carson well , first of all , i did n't say that the rate would be 10 percent i used the tithing analogy quick i i understand that , but if you if you look at the numbers you probably have to get to 28 carson the rate the rate the rate is gonna be much closer to 15 percent quick 15 percent still leaves you with a 11 trillion hole carson you also have to get rid of all the deductions and all the loopholes you also have to some strategically cutting in several places remember , we have 645 federal agencies and subagencies anybody who tells me that we need every penny and every one of those is in a fantasy world so , also , we can stimulate the economy that s gonna be the real growth engine stimulating the economy because it s tethered down right now with so many regulations quick you 'd have to cut you 'd have to cut government about 40 percent to make it work with a 11 trillion hole carson that s not true quick that is true , i looked at the numbers carson when when we put all the facts down , you 'll be able to see that it s not true , it works out very well quick dr carson , thank you kasich listen , i want to just comment harwood governor kasich , hold it , i'm coming to you right now the kasich well i want to comment on this this is the fantasy harwood well , i'm asking you about this kasich this is the fantasy that i talked about in the beginning harwood i'm about to ask you about this that is , you had some very strong words to say yesterday about what s happening in your party and what you 're hearing from the two gentlemen we 've just heard from would you repeat it \? kasich i'm the only person on this stage that actually was involved in the chief architect of balancing the federal budget you ca n't do it with empty promised you know , these plans would put us trillions and trillions of dollars in debt i actually have a plan i'm the only one on this stage that has a plan that would create jobs , cut taxes , balance the budget and can get it done because i'm realistic you just do n't make promises like this why do n't we just give a chicken in every pot , while we 're , you know , coming up coming up with these fantasy tax schemes we 'll just clean it up where are you gonna clean it up \? you have to deal with entitlements , you have to be in a position to control discretionary spending you gotta be creative and imaginative now , let me just be clear , john i went into ohio where we had an 8 billion hole and now we have a 2 billion surplus we 're up 347 , 000 jobs when i was in washington , i fought to get the budget balanced i was the architect it was the first time we did it since man walked on the moon we cut taxes and we had a 5 trillion projected surplus when i left that s was hard work fiscal discipline , know what you 're doing creativity this stuff is fantasy just like getting rid of medicare and medicaid come on , that s just not you scare senior citizens with that it s not responsible harwood well , let s just get more pointed about it you said yesterday that you were hearing proposals that were just crazy from your colleagues who were you talking about \? kasich well , i mean right here to talk about we 're just gonna have a 10 percent tithe and that s how we 're gonna fund the government \? and we 're going to just fix everything with waste , fraud , and abuse \? or that we 're just going to be great \? or we 're going to ship 10 million americans or 10 million people out of this country , leaving their children here in this country and dividing families \? folks , we 've got to wake up we cannot elect somebody that does n't know how to do the job you have got to pick somebody who has experience , somebody that has the knowhow , the discipline and i spent my entire lifetime balancing federal budgets , growing jobs , the same in ohio and i will go back to washington with my plan quintanilla governor governor thank you , governor kasich and i will have done it within 100 days , and it will pass and we will be strong again thank you quintanilla mr trump , 30 seconds trump first of all , john got lucky with a thing called fracking , ok \? he hit oil he got lucky with fracking believe me , that is why ohio is doing well number and that is important for you to know number two , this was the man that was a managing general partner at lehman brothers when it went down the tubes and almost took every one of us with it , including ben and myself , because i was there and i watched what happened and lehman brothers started it all he was on the board and he was a managing general partner and just thirdly , he was so nice he was such a nice guy and he said , oh , i'm never going to attack but then his poll numbers tanked he has got that is why he is on the end \( laughter \) and he got nasty and he got nasty so you know what \? you can have him \( crosstalk \) kasich let me just let me respond first of all , ohio does have an energy industry , but we 're diversified we 're one of the fastest growing states in the country we came back from the dead and you know what \? it works very , very well and secondly , when you talk about me being on the board of lehman brothers , i was n't on the board of lehman brothers i was a banker and i was proud of it and i traveled the country and learned how people made jobs we ought to have politicians who not only have government experience but know how the ceos and the job creators work my state is doing great across the board and guess what , in 2011 , i got a deal quick governor kasich an agreement with the \( crosstalk \) kasich that he tried to take credit for four years later it s a joke quintanilla thank you , governor quick dr carson , let me get 30 seconds with dr carson \( crosstalk \) carson since i was attacked too quick thank you carson let me just say , if you 're talking about an 18 trillion economy , you 're talking about a 15 percent tax on your gross domestic product you 're talking about 27 trillion we have a budget closer to 35 trillion but if you also apply that same 15 percent to several other things , including corporate taxes , and including the capital gains taxes , you make that amount up pretty quickly so that is not by any stretch a pie in the sky cruz becky , if you want a 10 percent flat tax where the numbers add up , i rolled out my tax plan today , you can find it on line at tedcruzorg it is a simple flat tax where for individuals , a family of four pays nothing on the first 36 , 000 after that you pay 10 percent as a flat tax going up the billionaire and the working man , no hedge fund manager pays less than his secretary on top of that , there is a business flat tax of 16 percent now that applies universally to giant corporations that with lobbyists right now are not paying taxes , and as small business and you wanted to know the numbers , the tax foundation , which has scored every one of our plans , shows that this plan will allow the economy to generate 49 million jobs , to raise wages over 12 percent , and to generate 14 percent growth and it costs , with dynamic scoring , less than a trillion dollars those are the hard numbers and every single income decile sees a doubledigit increase in aftertax income quick senator senator , thank you cruz growth is the answer and as reagan demonstrated , if we cut taxes , we can bring back growth quick gentlemen , i'm sorry , we need to \( crosstalk \) quintanilla we 're going to try to move on \( crosstalk \) fiorina let me just say on taxes , how long have we been talking about tax reform in washington , dc \? we have been talking about it for decades we now have a 73 , 000page tax code there have been more than 4 , 000 changes to the tax plan since 2001 alone there are loads of great ideas , great conservative ideas from wonderful think tanks about how to reform the tax code the problem is we never get it done we have talked about tax reform in every single election for decades it never happens and the politicians always say it is so complicated , nobody but a politician can figure it out the truth is this , the big problem , we need a leader in washington who understands how to get something done , not to talk about it , not to propose it , to get it done quintanilla you want to bring 70 , 000 pages to three \? fiorina that s right , three pages quintanilla is that using really small type \? fiorina you know why three \? quintanilla is that using really small type \? fiorina no you know why three \? because only if it s about three pages are you leveling the playing field between the big , the powerful , the wealthy and the wellconnected who can hire the armies of lawyers and accountants and , yes , lobbyists to help them navigate their way through 73 , 000 pages three pages is about the maximum that a single business owner or a farmer or just a couple can understand without hiring somebody almost 60 percent of american people now need to hire an expert to understand their taxes so yes , you 're going to hear a lot of talk about tax reform quintanilla mrs fiorina fiorina the issue is who is going to get it done \( crosstalk \) quintanilla we 're going to quick we 're going to move on quintanilla we will come around the bend , i promise this one is for senator rubio you 've been a young man in a hurry ever since you won your first election in your 20s you 've had a big accomplishment in the senate , an immigration bill providing a path to citizenship the conservatives in your party hate , and even you do n't support anymore now , you 're skipping more votes than any senator to run for president why not slow down , get a few more things done first or least finish what you start \? rubio that s an interesting question that s exactly what the republican establishment says too why do n't you wait in line \? wait for what \? this country is running out of time we ca n't afford to have another four years like the last eight years watching this broadcast tonight are millions of people that are living paycheck to paycheck they 're working as hard as they ever have , everything costs more , and they have n't had a raise in decades you have small businesses in america that are struggling for the first time in 35 years , we have more businesses closing than starting we have a world that s out of control and has grown dangerous and a president that is weakening our military and making our foreign policy unstable and unreliable in the eyes of our allies and our adversaries continue to grow stronger we have a they say there s no bipartisanship in washington \? we have a 19 trillion bipartisan debt and it continues to grow as we borrow money from countries that do not like us to pay for government we cannot afford the time to act is now the time to turn the page is now if we if we do n't act now , we are going to be the first generation in american history that leaves our children worse off than ourselves quintanilla so when the sunsentinel says rubio should resign , not rip us off , when they say floridians sent you to washington to do a job , when they say you act like you hate your job , do you \? rubio let me say , i read that editorial today with a great amusement it s actually evidence of the bias that exists in the american media today quintanilla well , do you hate your job \? rubio let me let me answer your question on the sunsentinel editorial today back in 2004 , one of my predecessors to the senate by the name of bob graham , a democrat , ran for president missing over 30 percent of his votes i do n't recall them calling for his resignation quintanilla is that the standard \? rubio later that year , in 2004 , john kerry ran for president missing close to 60 to 70 percent of his votes i do n't recall the sun in fact , the sunsentinel endorsed him in 2008 , barack obama missed 60 or 70 percent of his votes , and the same newspaper endorsed him again so this is another example of the double standard that exists in this country between the mainstream media and the conservative movement \( applause \) quintanilla senator , thank you john bush could i could i bring something up here , because i'm a constituent of the senator and i helped him and i expected that he would do constituent service , which means that he shows up to work he got endorsed by the sunsentinel because he was the most talented guy in the field he s a gifted politician but marco , when you signed up for this , this was a sixyear term , and you should be showing up to work i mean , literally , the senate what is it , like a french work week \? you get , like , three days where you have to show up \? you can campaign , or just resign and let someone else take the job there are a lot of people living paycheck to paycheck in florida as well , they 're looking for a senator that will fight for them each and every day rubio i get to respond , right \? quick thirty seconds rubio well , it s interesting over the last few weeks , i 've listened to jeb as he walked around the country and said that you 're modeling your campaign after john mccain , that you 're going to launch a furious comeback the way he did , by fighting hard in new hampshire and places like that , carrying your own bag at the airport you know how many votes john mccain missed when he was carrying out that furious comeback that you 're now modeling after \? bush he was n't my senator rubio no jeb , i do n't remember well , let me tell you i do n't remember you ever complaining about john mccain s vote record the only reason why you 're doing it now is because we 're running for the same position , and someone has convinced you that attacking me is going to help you bush well , i 've been rubio here s the bottom line \( applause \) i'm not my campaign is going to be about the future of america , it s not going to be about attacking anyone else on this stage i will continue to have tremendous admiration and respect for governor bush i'm not running against governor bush , i'm not running against anyone on this stage i'm running for president because there is no way we can elect hillary clinton to continue the policies of barack obama quintanilla thank you , senator trump i think you 're \( applause \) \( crosstalk \) harwood hold on i think there s a i 've got question for \( crosstalk \) kasich john harwood , there s a bigger issue here harwood hold on , governor i 've got a question for governor bush \( crosstalk \) harwood no , we 're moving to governor bush governor , the fact that you 're at the fifth lectern tonight shows how far your stock has fallen in this race , despite the big investment your donors have made harwood you noted recently , after slashing your payroll , that you had better things to do than sit around and be demonized by other people i wanted to ask you bush no , no what i said was i do n't believe that i would be president of the united states and have the same dysfunction that exists in washington , dc now harwood ok bush do n't vote for me if you want to keep the gridlock in washington , dc harwood got it bush but if you want someone who has a proven , effective leadership , that was a governor of a state , that transformed the culture there , elect me so i can fight for the american people and change the culture in washington , dc harwood but it s a ok it s a it s a question about why you 're having difficulty i want to ask you in this context ben bernanke , who was appointed fed chairman by your brother , recently wrote a book in which he said he no longer considers himself a republican because the republican party has given in to know nothingism is that why you 're having a difficult time in this race \? bush \( inaudible \) , the great majority of republicans and americans believe in a hopeful future they do n't believe in building walls and a pessimistic view of the future they 're concerned that washington is so dysfunctional it is holding them back there are lids on people s aspirations think about it six and a half million people working parttime workforce participation rates lower than they were in 1977 six million more people living in poverty than the day that barack obama got elected president , and the left just wants more of the same we have to offer a compelling alternative that is based on hope and optimism and grounded in serious policy , which i 've laid out and you can go get it at jeb2016com harwood thank you , governor \( crosstalk \) harwood we 're gonna get down the line becky s got a question quick we 'll get to everyone ms fiorina , i i 'd like to ask you a question you are running for president of the united states because of your record running hewlettpackard but the stock market is usually a fair indicator of the performance of a ceo , and the market was not kind to you someone who invested a dollar in your company the day you took office had lost half of the dollar by the day you left obviously , you 've talked in the past about what a difficult time it was for technology companies , but anybody who was following the market knows that your stock was a much worse performer , if you looked at your competitors , if you looked at the overall market i just wonder , in terms of all of that you know , we look back , your board fired you i just wondered why you think we should hire you now fiorina you know , the nasdaq dropped 80 percent 80 percent and it took 15 years for the nasdaq to recover i was recruited to hp to save a company it was a company that had grown into a bloated , inept bureaucracy that cost too much and delivered too little to customers and shareholders it had missed , before i had arrived , expectations for nine quarters in a row as an outsider , i tackled hp s entrenched problems headon i cut the bureaucracy down to size , reintroduced accountability , focused on service , on innovation , on leading in every market , in every product segment and yes , it was a very difficult time however , we saved 80 , 000 jobs and we went on to grow to 160 , 000 jobs , and scores of technology companies literally went out of business like gateway taking all their jobs with them the truth is i had to make some tough calls in some tough times i think , actually , people are looking for that in washington now and yes , i was fired over a disagreement in the boardroom there are politics in the boardroom as well and yet the man who led my firing , tom perkins , an icon of silicon valley , has come out publicly and said , you know what \? we were wrong she was right she was a great ceo she 'd be a great president of the united states because the leadership she brought to hp is exactly the leadership we need in washington , dc quick mrs fiorina , it s interesting that you bring up mr perkins , because \( applause \) he said a lot of very questionable things last year , in an interview , he said that he thinks wealthy people should get more votes than poor people i think his quote was that , if you pay zero dollars in taxes , you should get zero votes if you pay a million dollars , you should get a million votes is this the type of person you want defending you \? fiorina well , this is one of the reasons why tom perkins and i had disagreements in the boardroom , becky \( laughter \) nevertheless , one of the things that i think people do n't always understand is how accountable a ceo actually is so you know , i had to report results every 90 days in excruciating detail i had to answer every single question about every single result and every single projection in public until there were no more questions and if i misrepresented those results or those projections in any way , i was held criminally liable imagine imagine if a politician were held to that standard of account i will run on my record all day long \( applause \) and i believe people need a leader who is prepared to make tough calls in tough times and stand up quick mrs fiorina fiorina and be held accountable quick thank you , we 're out of time thank you , mrs fiorina carl quintanilla senator cruz congressional republicans , democrats and the white house are about to strike a compromise that would raise the debt limit , prevent a government shutdown and calm financial markets that fear of another washingtoncreated crisis is on the way does your opposition to it show that you 're not the kind of problemsolver american voters want \? cruz you know , let me say something at the outset the questions that have been asked so far in this debate illustrate why the american people do n't trust the media \( applause \) this is not a cage match and , you look at the questions donald trump , are you a comicbook villain \? ben carson , can you do math \? john kasich , will you insult two people over here \? marco rubio , why do n't you resign \? jeb bush , why have your numbers fallen \? how about talking about the substantive issues the people care about \? \( applause \) quintanilla \( inaudible \) do we get credit \( inaudible \) \? cruz and carl carl , i'm not finished yet cruz the contrast with the democratic debate , where every fawning question from the media was , which of you is more handsome and why \? \( laughter \) and let me be clear \( crosstalk \) quintanilla so , this is a question about \( inaudible \) , which you have 30 seconds left to answer , should you choose to do so cruz let me be clear the men and women on this stage have more ideas , more experience , more common sense than every participant in the democratic debate that debate reflected a debate between the bolsheviks and the mensheviks \( laughter \) and nobody watching at home believed that any of the moderators had any intention of voting in a republican primary the questions that are being asked should n't be trying to get people to tear into each other it should be what are your substantive positions \( crosstalk \) quintanilla ok \( inaudible \) i asked you about the debt limit and i got no answer \( crosstalk \) cruz you want me to answer that question \? i'm happy to answer the question \( crosstalk \) cruz let me tell you how that question \( crosstalk \) cruz let me tell you how that question \( crosstalk \) harwood senator paul , i 've got a question for you on the same subject cruz so you do n't actually want to hear the answer , john \? harwood senator paul \? cruz you do n't want to hear the answer you just want to \( crosstalk \) harwood you used your time on something else senator paul \? cruz you 're not interested in an answer \( crosstalk \) harwood senator paul , the budget deal crafted by speaker boehner and passed by the house today makes cuts in entitlement programs , medicare and social security disability , which are the very programs conservatives say need cutting to shrink government and solve our country s longterm budget deficit do you oppose that budget deal because it does n't cut those programs enough \? paul no , i oppose it because you 're taking money from the entitlement and then spending it immediately on other items that s what they 're doing they 're taking money from social security and they 're going to spend it on the military and they 're going to spend it on domestic spending here s the thing when you look at raising the debt limit , it should be leverage to try to reform government in 2011 , the sequester was passed as a reform to slow down the rate of government instead , the washington establishment raised both we raised the military spending , took from entitlements , and raised domestic spending and the deficit will explode under this this is the unholy alliance that people need to know about between right and left right and left are spending us into oblivion we should use the debt ceiling , as precisely to don , to force upon them budgetary reforms harwood senator , if what you just said is true , why did speaker boehner craft this deal and why did paul ryan , who has a strong reputation for fiscal discipline , vote for it \? paul well , that s a real question is there going to be any change in the house with new leadership \? i frankly do n't think there will be much change because i think what s going to happen is you 're going to get more of the same people in washington think they were sent there to be adults and govern and do all this well , you know what i'm worried about \? not keeping the government open i'm worried about bankrupting the american people we 're borrowing a million dollars a minute that is important and that s what we have to contrast keeping the government open and continuing to borrow a million dollars a minute \( crosstalk \) harwood thank you , senator \( inaudible \) quick governor christie , i 'd like to \( inaudible \) a question next actually , i have a question for you \( inaudible \) in your tell it like it is campaign , you 've said a lot of tough things you 've said that we need to raise the retirement age for social security you think that we need to cut benefits for people who make over 80 , 000 and eliminate them entirely for seniors who are making over 200 , 000 governor huckabee , who is here on the stage , has said that you and others who think this way are trying to rob seniors of the benefits that they 've earned it raises the question when it is acceptable to break a social compact \? ritchie well , i wish you would have asked that question years ago when they broke it i mean , let me be honest with the people who are watching at home the government has lied to you and they have stolen from you they told you that your social security money is in a trust fund all that s in that trust fund is a pile of ious for money they spent on something else a long time ago and they 've stolen from you because now they know they cannot pay these benefits and social security is going to be insolvent in seven to eight years we 're sitting up here talking about all these other things 71 percent of federal spending today is on entitlements , and debt service and , that s with zero percent interest rates now , i'm the only person that s put out a detailed plan on how to deal with entitlements and we 'll save a trillion dollars over the next 10 years and , here s the difference between me and hillary clinton what hillary clinton s going to say , and has said before is , she wants to raise social security taxes now , let me ask you a question everybody , and , this is for the guy , you know , who owns a landscaping business out there if somebody s already stolen money from you , are you going to give them more \? or , are you going to deal with the problem by saying , i'm going to give people who 've done well in this country less benefit on the backend we need to get realistic about this we 're not the american people forget about anything else , they 've already been lied to and stolen from and quick governor christie i'm going to go to washington to stop it quick thank you quintanilla we promised we would get to everyone this block governor huckabee , i'm going to give you 60 seconds on this huckabee well , i would really appreciate that first of all , yes , we 've stolen yes , we 've lied to the american people about social security , and medicare but , you know what we 're not telling them \? it s their money this is n't the governments money this is not entitlement , it s not welfare this is money that people have confiscated out of their paychecks everytime they got a paycheck , the government reached in and took something out of it before they ever saw it now , we 're going to blame the people today congress decided to take another 150 billion dollars away from social security so they can borrow more money that makes no sense to everybody and , they 're always going to say , well , we 're going to fix this one day no their not it s like a 400 pound man saying , i'm going to go on a diet , but i'm eating a sack of krispy kremes before i do and , people are sick of believing that the government is never going to really address this but , let me tell you who not to blame let s quit blaming the people on social security let s quit making it a problem for them it s like them getting mugged , and then us saying , well , we 're going to mug you some more you ought to just be able to get over it , get used to it quintanilla governor huckabee no , sir quintanilla thank you , governor huckabee we need to honor our promises \( crosstalk \) quintanilla senator cruz huckabee before i go this is the only time i 've had a chance , let me finish quintanilla ok , alright huckabee this is a matter not of math , this is a matter of morality if this country that does not keep its promise to seniors then what promise can this country hope to be trusted to keep \? and , the fact is , none of them \( crosstalk \) male and , by the way , carl \( applause \) huckabee and , the only way no \( crosstalk \) christie the only way we 're going to be morale , the only way we 're going to keep our promise to seniors is start by following the first rule we should all follow , which is to look at them , treat them like adults , and tell them the truth it is n't there anymore , mike they stole it it got stolen from them it s not theirs anymore the government stole it , and spent it a long time ago huckabee chris christie so , let s stop fooling around about this , let s tell people the truth for once , let s do that , and stop trying to give them some kind of fantasy that s never going to come true quintanilla senator cruz huckabee chris quintanilla before we go to break , we 're clearly not having that beer you mentioned , but i 'll give you 30 more seconds cruz then i 'll buy you a tequila quintanilla ok cruz or , even some famous colorado brownies quintanilla i 'll give you 30 seconds to respond \( cheering \) quintanilla \( inaudible \) huckabee since he brought me up , do i not get to respond \? quintanilla respond on the debt limit , or an answer to the governor , which ever you choose cruz well , sure this deal in washington is an example of why washington s broken republican leadership joined with every single democrat , add 80 trillion to our debt to do nothing to fix the problems and , let me now on social security because we were getting into a good substantive exchange , and i want to say i think both chris , and mike are right governor huckabee s exactly right , we need to honor the promises made to our seniors , but for younger workers look i'm 44 years old it is hard to find someone in my generation that thinks social security will be there for us we can save and preserve and strengthen social security by making no changes for seniors , but for younger workers gradually increasing the retirement age , changing the rate of growth so that it matches inflation , and critically allowing younger workers to keep a portion of our tax payments in a personal account that we own , we control them , we can pass on to our kids quintanilla 30 seconds , governor huckabee huckabee john , listen , let s keep in mind that for onethird of the 60 million americans on social security it represents 90 percent of their income and , when i hear people talking about means testing , let s just remember what that means if we means test social security , it means that the government decides whether or not i deserve it if a person lives in a seven room house , does the government get to say you do n't need seven rooms , we 're going to take two of them away \? huckabee folks , the government has no business stealing even more from the people who have paid this in i just want to remind you , people paid their money they expect to have it and , if this government does n't pay it , than tell me what s different between the government and bernie madolf , who sits in prison today for doing less than what the government has done to the people on social security and medicare in this country \( applause \) quintanilla governor , thank you we will take a break the republican presidential debate , live from boulder , colorado , coming back after a break on cnbc \( applause \) \( commercial break \) quick welcome back to the presidential debate for the republicans we are live in boulder , colorado , right here on cnbc folks , we 'll get right back into this mr trump , let s talk a little bit about bankruptcies your atlantic city casinos filed for bankruptcy four times in fact , fitch , the ratings agency , even said that they were serial filers for all of this you said that you did great with atlantic city , and you did but some of the individuals the bondholders , some of the contractors who worked for you , did n't fare so well bankruptcy is a broken promise why should the voters believe the promises that you 're telling them right now \? trump well , first of all , like many other very big businessmen , i could name them here , but i'm not going to do that for a lot of obvious reasons , but the biggest , and almost all of them , they 've all used the chapter laws , the bankruptcy laws to their own benefit before this , i was a very successful person as a developer and as a businessman atlantic city has gone bad i mean , chris will know about that i'm not blaming chris , by the way , but he will know about that caesar s excuse me caesar s , the rollsroyce , as you know , is in bankruptcy almost every hotel in atlantic city has either been in bankruptcy or will be in bankruptcy the biggest but also the biggest people \( ph \) now i 've used that to my advantage as a business man , for my family , for myself i never filed for bankruptcy but many , many people did what happened with atlantic city is very , very disgraceful now hundreds of companies i 've opened i 've used it three times , maybe four times came out great but i guess i'm supposed to come out great that is what i could do for the country we owe 19 trillion , boy am i good at solving debt problems nobody can solve it like me but i will tell you this , atlantic city , you 're using that , hundreds of companies that i have opened have thrived i built a net worth of way over 10 billion , and i have done it four times out of hundreds and i'm glad i did it i used the laws of the country to my benefit , i'm sorry quick mr trump , thank you trump thank you cramer dr carson , in recent weeks , a number of pharmaceutical companies has been accused of profiteering , for dramatically raising the prices of lifesaving drugs you have spent a lifetime in medicine have these companies gone too far \? should the government be involved in controlling some of these price increases \? carson well , there is no question that some people go overboard when it comes to trying to make profits , and they do n't take into consideration the american people what we have to start thinking about , as leaders , particularly in government , is what can we do for the average american \? and you think about the reasons that we 're having such difficulty right now with our job market well , the average small manufacturer , whatever they 're manufacturing , drugs or anything , if they have less than 50 employees , the average cost in terms of regulations is 34 , 000 per employee makes it a whole lot easier for them to want to go somewhere else so what we 're going to have to start doing instead of , you know , picking on this group or this group , is we 're going to have to have a major reduction in the regulatory influence that is going on the government is not supposed to be in every part of our lives , and that is what is causing the problem cramer thank you , dr carson governor christie , there has been a lot of political rhetoric that some bank executives should have gone to jail for the 2008 financial crisis but general motors paid more than 1 billion in fines and settlements for its ignition switch defect one hundred and twenty four people died as a result of these faulty switches no one went to jail as a former prosecutor , do you believe the people responsible for the switch and the coverup belong behind bars \? christie you bet they do and if i were the prosecutor , that is exactly where they would be the fact is that this justice department under this president has been a political justice department it has been a justice department that decided that they want to pick who the winners and losers are they like general motors , so they give them a pass they do n't like somebody else like david petraeus , they prosecute them and send a decorated general on to disgrace it s a political justice department and , jim , you know full well that in the seven years i was us attorney we went after pharmaceutical companies we went after companies that were ripping off shareholders we went after companies that were doing things that were against the law and to expand on mr carson s or dr carson s question , let s face it , we have laws already we do n't need newer \( ph \) laws we do n't need hillary clinton s price controls for again , does anybody out there think that giving washington , dc , the opportunity to run the pharmaceutical industry is a good idea , given how well they have done running the government \? so what we do , though , is , if there is somebody who is price gouging , we have laws for prosecutors to take that on let s let a justice department and i will make an attorney general who will enforce the law and make justice more than just a word it will be a way of life cramer thank you , governor christie harwood jim , thanks governor bush , in a debate like this four years ago , every republican running for president pledged to oppose a budget deal containing any tax increase even if it had spending cuts ten times as large a few months later , you told congress , put me in , coach , you said you would take that deal still feel that way \? bush well , the deal was done barack obama got his massive tax increase , and there was no spending cuts you just see the recent deal announced today or yesterday , more spending , more tax increasing , more regulation and now we have to accept 2 percent , the new normal for economic growth and the net result is the middle class has 2 , 300 less in their pockets than the day that barack obama got elected president and now they see hillary clinton proposing a third term of economic policy for our country we need to reverse that and my record was one of cutting taxes each and every year you do n't have to guess about it , because i actually have a record 19 billion of tax cuts , 13 million jobs created we were one of two states to go to aaa bond rating , and our government spending was far less than the spending in people s income harwood but to to the point that you made to congress , if you were president and you were offered a bipartisan deal that had one dollar bush you find me harwood one dollar of tax increases per ten dollars of spending cuts , would you take it \? bush you find me a democrat you find me a democrat that will cut spending ten dollars \? heck , find me a republican in congress that would cut spending ten dollars i 'll talk to them harwood so you do n't want the coach to put you in any more \? bush look , the the deal is already done the biggest tax increase happened under the watch of barack obama , and spending s gone up you find a democrat that s for cutting taxes cutting spending ten dollars , i 'll give them a warm kiss \( laughter \) harwood thank you , governor carl \? quintanilla mrs fiorina , in 2010 , while running for senate in tech ridge \( ph \) , california , you called an internet sales tax a bad idea traditional brick and mortar stores obviously disagree now that the internet shopping playing field has matured , what would be a fair plan to even that playing field \? fiorina you know , i want to go back for a moment to what we were just talking about crony capitalism is alive and well , and has been so in washington , dc for decades what s crony capitalism \? crony capitalism is what happens when government gets so big and so powerful that only the big and the powerful can handle it so why are the pharmaceutical companies consolidating \? why are there five even bigger wall street banks now , instead of the ten we used to have on wall street \? because when government gets big and powerful , the big feel like they need to get even bigger to deal with all that power , and meanwhile , the small and the powerless in this case , 1 , 590 community banks go out of business you see , folks , this is how socialism starts government causes a problem , and then government steps in to solve the problem this is why , fundamentally , we have to take our government back the student loan problem has been created by government government trying to level the playing field between internet and brickandmortar creates a problem the fcc jumping in now and saying , we 're going to put 400 pages of regulation over the internet , is going to create massive problems but guess who pushed for that regulation \? the big internet companies this is what s going on big and powerful use big and powerful government to their advantage it s why you see walgreens buying rite aid it s why you see the pharmaceuticals getting together it s you see the health insurance companies getting together it s why you see the banks consolidating and meanwhile , small businesses are getting crushed community based businesses and farms are getting crushed community banks are going out of business big government favors the big , the powerful , the wealthy and the wellconnected , and crushes the small and the powerless quintanilla mrs fiorina fiorina it is why we have to simplify it is why we have to reduce the size and power of government quintanilla ok fiorina it s the only way to level the playing field between big and powerful and small and powerless quintanilla thank you very much \( applause \) quick senator rubio , you yourself have said that you 've had issues you have a lack of bookkeeping skills you accidentally intermingled campaign money with your personal money you faced \( ph \) foreclosure on a second home that you bought and just last year , you liquidated a 68 , 000 retirement fund that s something that cost you thousands of dollars in taxes and penalties in terms of all of that , it raises the question whether you have the maturity and wisdom to lead this 17 trillion economy what do you say \? rubio well , you just you just listed a litany of discredited attacks from democrats and my political opponents , and i'm not gonna waste 60 seconds detailing them all but i'm going to tell you the truth here s the truth i did n't inherit any money my dad was a bartender , my mother was a maid they worked hard to provide us the chance at a better life they did n't save enough money for us to go to school i had to work my way through school i had to borrow money to go to school i tried \( ph \) , early in my marriage , explaining to my wife why someone named sallie mae was taking 1 , 000 out of our bank account every month \( laughter \) i know what it s like to owe that money , and we 've worked hard we 've worked hard our whole life to provide a better family a better life for our family we own a home four blocks away from the place that i grew up in my four children have been able to receive a good christian education , and i 've been able to save for them to go to college so they never have to have the loans that i did but i'm not worried about my finances , i'm worried about the finances of everyday americans who today are struggling in an economy that is not producing good paying jobs while everything else costs more and that s what this economy needs to that s what this debate needs to be about this debate needs to be about the men and women across this country that are struggling on a daily basis to provide for their families the better future that we 've always said this country is all about quick senator , i understand all of that i had a lot of student loans when i got out , too but you 've had a windfall that a lot of americans have n't you made over a million dollars on a book deal , and some of these problems came after that rubio and i used it to pay off my loans and it s available on paperback , if you 're interested in buying my book \( applause \) quick but you but you liquidated that retirement account after the fact , and that cost you about 24 , 000 out of that in taxes and feed that that was after you 'd already come into that windfall that s why i raised the question rubio yeah , again , as i said , we 're raising a family in the 21st century and it s one of the reasons why my tax plan is a pro family tax plan it increases the per child tax credit , because i did n't read about this in a book i know for a fact how difficult it is to raise children , how expensive it s become for working families and i make a lot more than the average american imagine how hard it is for these people out there that are making 40 , 50 , 60 , 000 a year , and they 're trying to provide for their families at a time when this economy is not growing we ca n't afford another four years of that which is what we 're gonna get if we elect a big government liberal like hillary clinton to the white house thank you , senator harwood governor john kasich , you 've called for abolishing the export import bank , which provides subsidies to help american companies compete with overseas competitors you call that corporate welfare one of the largest newspapers in your state wrote an editorial , said they found that strange , writing , that if that s corporate welfare , what does kasich call the millions of dollars in financial incentives doled out to attract or retain jobs by his development effort jobs ohio if subsidies are good enough for ohio companies , why are n't they good enough for companies trying to compete overseas \? kasich well , first of all , when we talk about the import export bank , it s time to clean up corporate welfare if we 're gonna reform welfare for poor people , we ought to reform it for rich people , as well secondly , in our state , we went from a loss of 350 , 000 jobs to , now , a gain of 347 , 000 jobs to the positive our wages are growing faster than the national average , and i 've cut taxes more than any sitting governor in this state 5 billion , including no taxes on small business and killing the death tax i want to go back to what we were talking about earlier , this budget deal in washington this is the same old stuff since i left you spend the money today and then you hope you 're going to save money tomorrow i do n't know if people understand , but i spent a lifetime with my colleagues getting us to a federal balanced budget we actually did it and i have a road map and a plan right now to get us to balance reforming entitlements , cutting taxes you see , because if you really want to get to a balanced budget , you need to reduce your expenses and you need to grow your economy so what i will tell you about our incentives our incentives are tight , and at the end of the day we make sure that we gain more from the creation of jobs than what we lose and you know what \? ohio , one of the best growing places in the country i not only did it in washington , i did it in ohio , and i 'll go back to washington , and there will be no more silly deals harwood thank you , governor kasich if i become president because we 'll have a constitutional amendment to require a federally balanced budget so they will do their job harwood thank you , governor thank you quick yes , thank you john senator cruz , working women in this country still earn just 77 percent of what men earn and i know that you 've said you 've been very sympathetic to our cause but you 've also you said that the democrats' moves to try and change this are the political show votes i just wonder what you would do as president to try and help in this cause \? cruz well , we 've gotta turn the economy around for people who are struggling the democrats' answer to everything is more government control over wages , and more empowering trial lawyers to file lawsuits you know , you look at women working i 'll tell you , in my family there are a lot of single moms in my family my sister was a single mom , both of my aunts who were a single moms my mom who s here today , was a single mom when my father left us when i was 3 years old now , thank god , my father was invited to a bible study and became born again and he came back to my mom and me and we were raised together but i the struggle of single moms is extraordinary and you know , when you see hillary clinton and bernie sanders and all the democrats talking about wanting to address the plight of working women , not a one of them mentioned the fact that under barack obama , 37 million women have entered poverty not a one of them mentioned the fact that under barack obama and the big government economy , the median wage for women has dropped 733 the the truth of the matter is , big government benefits the wealthy , it benefits the lobbyists , it benefits the giant corporations and the people who are getting hammered are small businesses , it s single moms , it s hispanics that is who i'm fighting for the people that washington leaves behind \( crosstalk \) fiorina becky , it is the height of hypocrisy for mrs clinton to talk about being the first woman president , when every single policy she espouses , and every single policy of president obama has been demonstrably bad for women fiorina 92 percent 92 percent of the jobs lost during barack obama s first term belonged to women senator cruz is precisely right three million women have fallen into poverty under this administration the number of women quick mrs fiorina fiorina living in extreme poverty is the highest level on record i am a conservative because i know our values , our principles and our policies quick mrs fiorina , we will come back to you fiorina work better to lift everyone up , men and women quick thank you , mrs fiorina carl \? \( applause \) quintanilla dr carson , we know you as a physician , but we wanted to ask you about your involvement on some corporate boards , including costco s last year , a marketing study called the warehouse retailer the number one gayfriendly brand in america , partly because of its domestic partner benefits why would you serve on a company whose policies seem to run counter to your views on homosexuality \? carson well , obviously , you do n't understand my views on homosexuality i believe that our constitution protects everybody , regardless of their sexual orientation or any other aspect i also believe that marriage is between one man and one woman and there is no reason that you ca n't be perfectly fair to the gay community they should n't automatically assume that because you believe that marriage is between one man and one woman that you are a homophobe and this is one of the myths that the left perpetrates on our society , and this is how they frighten people and get people to shut up you know , that s what the pc culture is all about , and it s destroying this nation the fact of the matter is we the american people are not each other s enemies , it s those people who are trying to divide us who are the enemies and we need to make that very clear to everybody \( applause \) quintanilla one more question this is a company called mannatech , a maker of nutritional supplements , with which you had a 10year relationship they offered claims that they could cure autism , cancer , they paid 7 million to settle a deceptive marketing lawsuit in texas , and yet you 're involvement continued why \? carson well , that s easy to answer i did n't have an involvement with them that is total propaganda , and this is what happens in our society total propaganda i did a couple of speeches for them , i do speeches for other people they were paid speeches it is absolutely absurd to say that i had any kind of a relationship with them do i take the product \? yes i think it s a good product quintanilla to be fair , you were on the homepage of their website with the logo over your shoulder carson if somebody put me on their homepage , they did it without my permission quintanilla does that not speak to your vetting process or judgment in any way carson no , it speaks to the fact that i do n't know those \( audience boos \) see \? they know \( applause \) quintanilla apparently we will take a break we 'll be back in boulder in just a minute \( commercial break \) harwood welcome back to the republican presidential debate on cnbc , live from boulder , colorado at the university of colorado senator huckabee , i mean excuse me senator rubio , wired magazine recently carried the heading , marco rubio wants to be the tech industry s savior it noted your support for dramatically increasing immigration visas called h1b , which are designed for workers with the special skills that silicon valley wants but your senate colleague , jeff sessions of alabama , says in reality , the tech industry uses this program to undercut hiring and wages for highly qualified americans why is he wrong \? rubio well , first of all , if a company gets caught doing that , they should never be able to use the program again if you get caught abusing this program , you should never be able to use it again the second thing i said is we need to add reforms , not just increase the numbers , but add reforms for example , before you hire anyone from abroad , you should have to advertise that job for 180 days you also have to prove that you 're going to pay these people more than you would pay someone else , so that you 're not undercutting it by bringing in cheap labor but here s the best solution of all we need to get back to training people in this country to do the jobs of the 21st century why , for the life of me , i do not understand why did we stop doing vocational education in america , people that can work with their hands people you can train to do this work while they 're still in high school so they can graduate ready to go work but the best way to close this gap is to modernize higher education so americans have the skills for those jobs but in the interim , in the absence of that , what s happening is some of these tech companies are taking those those centers \( ph \) to canada because they can get people to go over there instead of here but the ideal scenario is to train americans to do the work so we do n't have to rely on people from abroad harwood it sounds like you think senator sessions is wrong to believe there is enough abuse in that program that we should n't \( crosstalk \) rubio well , i believe that there are abuses , those companies should be permanently barred from ever using the program again and we should put strict standards in place to ensure that they 're not being abused , like the prevailing wage requirement and like the advertising requirement harwood thank you , senator becky \? quick mr trump , let s stay on this issue of immigration you have been very critical of mark zuckerberg of facebook who has wanted to increase the number of these h1bs trump i was not at all critical of him i was not at all in fact , frankly , he s complaining about the fact that we 're losing some of the most talented people they go to harvard they go to yale they go to princeton they come from another country and they 're immediately sent out i am all in favor of keeping these talented people here so they can go to work in silicon valley quick so you 're in favor of \( crosstalk \) trump so i have nothing at all critical of him quick where did i read this and come up with this that you were \( crosstalk \) trump probably , i do n't know you people write the stuff i do n't know where you \( laughter \) \( applause \) trump and if i could say just one thing i am the only person in either campaign that s selffunding i'm putting up 100 percent of my own money and right now , i will be putting up a tremendous so far , i 've put up less than anybody and i have the best results would n't that be nice if the country could do that \?

it s poor people and middle class does n't hurt rich people if their bar of soap goes up ten cents , but it hurts the poor and the middle class and bernie sanders will tell them that it s because of the rich well , i 'll tell you something you can take everything from the top 1 percent , and you apply it to our fiscal gap , and you wo n't even make a dent in it santelli thank you , doctor becky \? quick rick , thank you very much governor huckabee , you have railed against income inequality you 've said that some wall street executives should have gone to jail over the roles that they played during the financial crisis apart from your tax plan , are there specific steps you would require from corporate america to try and reduce the income inequality huckabee i do n't think it s so much about when the government orders a corporation to do something in fact , that s part of the problem if you saw that blimp that got cut loose from maryland today , it s a perfect example of government i mean , what we had was something the government made basically a bag of gas that cut loose , destroyed everything in its path , left thousands of people powerless , but they could n't get rid of it because we had too much money invested in it , so we had to keep it that is our government today we saw it in the blimp \( applause \) that s exactly what we saw so look , corporations ought to exercise some responsibility when ceo income has risen 90 percent above the average worker , when the bottom 90 percent of this country s economy has had stagnant wages for the past 40 years , somebody is taking it in the teeth and it s not the folks on wall street i'm not antiwall street , but i do n't believe the government ought to wear a team jersey , pick winners and losers quick governor \?

huckabee we need to be focusing on what fixes this country and i 'll tell you one thing that we never talk about we have n't talked about it tonight why are n't we talking about instead of cutting benefits for old people , cutting benefits for sick people why do n't we say , let s cure the four big costdriving diseases quick governor \? huckabee diabetes , heart disease , cancer and alzheimer s \? quick governor , i'm sorry huckabee if you do that , you do n't just change the economy , you transform the lives of millions of hurting americans quick governor , thank you huckabee gosh , i 'd love for us to talk about something like that thank you quick governor , thank you appreciate it john \? harwood governor bush , the tax reform bill that ronald reagan signed in 1986 cut the top personal income tax rate to 28 percent just like your plan does but president reagan taxed capital gains at the same rate , while you would tax them at just 20 percent given the problems we 've been discussing , growing gap between rich and poor , why would you tax labor at a higher rate than income from investments \? bush look , the the simple fact is that my plan actually gives the middle class the greatest break 2 , 000 per family and if you make 40 , 000 a year , a family of four , you do n't pay any income tax at all simplifying the code and lowering rates , both for corporations and and personal rates , is exactly what we need to do you think about the regulatory cost and the tax cost that s why small businesses are closing , rather than being formed in our country right now the big corporations have the scale to deal with all of this and what i think all of us are saying is , our monetary policy , our tax policy , regulatory policy needs to be radically changed so we can create high sustained growth for income to rise the government has tried it their way under under barack obama and the proposals of hillary clinton and bernie sanders and others , they 've tried it their way , and it has failed miserably we need to take a new approach of taxing reforming how we tax , and reforming the regulations in our in our country before it s too late harwood senator rubio , 30 seconds to you the tax foundation , which was alluded to earlier , scored your tax plan and concluded that you give nearly twice as much of a gain in aftertax income to the top 1 percent as to people in the middle of the income scale since you 're the champion of americans living paycheckto paycheck , do n't you have that backward \? rubio no , that s you 're wrong in fact , the largest after tax gains is for the people at the lower end of the tax spectrum under my plan and there s a bunch of things my tax plan does to help them number one , you have people in this country that harwood the tax foundation just to be clear , they said the \( crosstalk \) rubio you wrote a story on it , and you had to go back and correct it harwood no , i did not rubio you did no , you did \( applause \) \( crosstalk \) harwood senator , the tax foundation said aftertax income for the top 1 percent under your plan would go up 279 percent rubio well , you 're talking about yeah harwood and people in the middle of the income spectrum , about 15 percent rubio yeah , but that because the math is , if you 5 percent of a million is a lot more than 5 percent of a thousand so yeah , someone who makes more money harwood \( inaudible \) rubio numerically , it s gonna be higher but the greatest gains , percentagewise , for people , are gonna be at the lower end of our plan , and here s why because in addition to a general personal exemption , we are increasing the perchild tax credit for working families we are lowering taxes on small business you know , a lot of business activity in america is conducted like the guy that does my dry cleaning he s an s corporation he pays on his personal rate , and he is paying higher than the big drycleaning chain down the street , because he s paying at his personal rate rubio under my plan , no business , big or small , will pay more than 25 percent flat rate on their business income that is a dramatic tax decrease for hardworking people who run their own businesses \( crosstalk \) rubio the other thing i 'd like to make about our plan , one more point , it is the most pro growth tax plan that i can imagine because it does n't tax investments at all you know why \? because the more you tax something , the less of it you get i want to be in i want america to be the best paul john rubio in the world for people harwood senator , thank you paul john , i 'd like to address this \? john , could i follow up on this \? quintanilla we 'll come back around i want to get to governor kasich paul what are the rules on who gets to follow up how do we decide on who gets to follow up \? i 've seen plenty of other people follow up \? quick it s at the moderator discretion quintanilla governor kasich , let s talk \( crosstalk \) quintanilla about marijuana , governor kasich paul i 'd like to just mention something about my tax plan , and how it relates to the discussion quintanilla alright , but 30 seconds , you made a case sure , 30 seconds paul alright much of the discussion is centered over whether or not the different tax plans help , or affect the middle class in fact , it s the chief argument by democrats against many of the different flat tax proposals mine is unique in the sense that my tax plan actually gets rid of the payroll tax as well it shifts it to the business , and it would allow middle class people to get a tax cut if you just cut their income tax , there is n't much income tax to cut mine actually cuts the payroll tax , and i think it would spread the tax cut across all socioeconomic levels , and would allow then it to be something that would be broadly supported by the public in an election quintanilla senator , thank you cruz let me say on that quintanilla oh , no , no , no cruz rand is exactly right his plan is a good plan , and i will note that my 10 plan also eliminates the payroll tax , eliminates the death tax , quintanilla ok cruz eliminates the business male \( inaudible \) cruz income tax male what are you doing \? cruz 10 flat rate quintanilla we 're going to go to cruz is the lowest personal rate any candidate up here has , and what it would also enable us to do is for every citizen to fill out their taxes on a postcard so we can eliminate the irs \( cheering \) \( applause \) quintanilla ok thank you , senator governor kasich , let s talk about marijuana we 're broadcasting from colorado which has seen 150 million in new revenue for the state since legalizing last year governor hickenlooper is not a big fan of legalization , but he s said the people who used to be smoking it are still smoking it , they 're just now paying taxes given the budget pressures in ohio , and other states , is this a revenue stream you 'd like to have \? kasich well , first of all , we 're running a 2 billion dollar surplus , we 're not having a revenue problem right now and , sending mixed signals to kids about drugs is a disaster drugs is one of the greatest scourge in this country , and i spent five years of my administration working with my team to do a whole sort of things to try to reign in the problem of overdoses , and it goes on and on we could do a whole show on that i want to go back for a second thought on this issue of income inequality my program would move the 104 programs of the federal department of education into four block grants , and send them back to the states because income inequality is driven by a lack of skills when kids do n't get what they need to be able to compete and win in this country the fact is , in order to get this economy moving again , i call for freezing regulations for a year except for the problem of public safety i believe that we need to cut these taxes down , we need to be on a roadmap to balancing the budget , and we need to send power , money , and influence , the welfare department , the education department , job training , infrastructure , medicaid , all of that out of washington back to the states so we can run these programs from where we live to the top , not a one size fits all mentality that they have in washington and , that will get to the nub of opportunity for our children , and an ability to see wages rise again \( crosstalk \) kasich one more time , in ohio , our wages are growing faster than the national average we 've cut taxes , balanced budgets , changed the regulatory environment folks , you want to quintanilla thank you , governor kasich fix america , this is the formula it worked for reagan and it works for our team in ohio thank you quintanilla thank you we 'll be back from boulder , colorado in just a moment \( applause \) \( break \) quick welcome back to the university of colorado and the republican presidential debate right here on cnbc mr trump , i want to go back to an issue that we were talking about before , the h1b visas i found where i read that before it was from the donaldjtrumpcom website and it says it says that again , mark zuckerburg s personal senator , marco rubio has a bill to triple h1bs that would decimate women and minorities are you in favor of h1bs or are you opposed to them \? trump i'm in favor of people coming into this country legally and you know what \? they can have it anyway you want you can call it visas , you can call it work permits , you can call it anything you want i 've created tens of thousands of jobs , and in all due respect and actually some of these folks i really like a lot but i'm the only one that can say that i have created tens of thousands of jobs , and i 'll be creating many millions of jobs if i'm given if i'm given the opportunity to be president as far as mark is concerned , as far as the visas are concerned , if we need people , they have it s fine they have to come into this country legally we have a country of borders we have a country of laws we have to obey the laws it s fine if they come in , but they have to come in legally quick thank you , sir rubio i was mentioned in the question quick you were you get 30 seconds rubio thank you well , i 've learned the rules on this \( laughter \) look , in addition to what donald was saying is we also need to talk about the legal immigration system for permanent residents today , we have a legal immigration system for permanent residency that is largely based on whether or not you have a relative living here and that s the way my parents came legally in 1956 but in 2015 , we have a very different economy our legal immigration system from now on has to be meritbased it has to be based on what skills you have , what you can contribute economically , and most important of all , on whether or not you 're coming here to become an american , not just live in america , but be an american quick thank you , senator thank you , senator carl \? quintanilla mr trump , you 've said you have a special permit to carry a gun in new york trump yes quintanilla after the oregon mass shooting on october 1st , you said , by the way , it was a gunfree zone if you had a couple of teachers with guns , you would have been a hell of a lot better off trump or somebody else right quintanilla would you feel more comfortable if your employees brought guns to work \? trump yes , i might feel more comfortable i would say that i would and i have a permit , which is very unusual in new york a permit to carry and i do carry on occasion , sometimes a lot but i like to be unpredictable so that people do n't know exactly \( laughter \) quintanilla are you carrying one now \? \( laughter \) \( crosstalk \) trump by the way , unlike our country where we 're totally predictable and the enemy , whether it s isis or anybody else , they know exactly what we 're doing because we have the wrong leadership \( applause \) but i feel that the gunfree zones and , you know , when you say that , that s target practice for the sickos and for the mentally ill that s target they look around for gunfree zones you know , we could give you another example the marines , the army , these wonderful six soldiers that were killed two of them were among the most highly decorated they were n't allowed on a military base to have guns and somebody walked in and shot them , killed them if they had guns , he would n't be around very long i can tell you , there would n't have been much damage so , i think gunfree zones are a catastrophe they 're a feeding frenzy for sick people quintanilla we called a few trump resorts , a few trump properties that that do not allow guns with or without a permit would you change those policies \? trump i would change them i would change them quintanilla ok all right thank you john \? harwood governor huckabee , you 've written about the huge divide in values between middle america and the big coastal cities like new york and los angeles as a preacher as well as a politician , you know that presidents need the moral authority to bring the entire country together the leading republican candidate , when you look at the average of national polls right now , is donald trump when you look at him , do you see someone with the moral authority to unite the country \?

well , i did and not only did i fight them and win , i lived to tell about it and i'm standing on this stage tonight as evidence of that and i think that ought to be worth something harwood thank you , governor christie john , i 'll tell you something you want to talk about moral authority let s talk about something that happened this week in the news you know , the fbi director , the president s appointed fbi director has said this week that because of a lack of support from politicians like the president of the united states , that police officers are afraid to get out of their cars that they 're afraid to enforce the law and he says , the president s appointee , that crime is going up because of this and when the president of the united states gets out to speak about it , does he support police officers \? does he stand up for law enforcement \? no , he does n't i 'll tell you this , the number one job of the president of the united states is to protect the safety and security of the american people this president has failed , and when i'm in the oval office , police officers will know that they will have the support of the president of the untied states that s real moral authority that we need in the oval office harwood thank you , governor do n't forget my colleague , sharon epperson epperson thank you , john mrs fiorina , you were the ceo of a large corporation that offers a 401 \( k \) to its employees but more than half of american have no access to an employer sponsored retirement plan that includes the workers at small businesses , and the growing ranks of uber drivers and other parttimers in the freelance economy should the federal government play a larger role in helping to set up retirement plans for these workers \? fiorina no , the federal government should not play a larger role look , every time the federal government gets engaged in something it gets worse and then the government steps in to try and solve the problem and we get a little further down to that progressive vision that hillary clinton is talking about companies should , if they want to attract the best workers , provide a good set of benefits but honestly , if you 're a small business owner today you are being crushed we have 400 , 000 small businesses forming every year in this country how great is that \? they are employing themselves , they are potentially employing others the bad news is , we have 470 , 000 going out of business every year and why \? they cite obamacare they are refusing to epperson so you would n't agree you would n't agree with a start for 401 \( k \) for businesses or anything like that \? fiorina i think it s a wonderful that that businesses start a 401 \( k \) the point i'm making is this , the federal government should not be in a lot of things there is no constitutional role for the federal government in setting up retirement plans there is no constitutional role for the federal government to be setting minimum wages epperson thank you very much fiorina the more the government gets engaged in the economy , the slower the economy becomes the more the government gets engaged in the economy , it is demonstrably true epperson thank you , the rules say one minute fiorina the more the big , the powerful , the wealthy and the wellconnected are advantaged epperson thank you , ms fiorina we appreciate it thank you , thank you i want to turn my attention now , to you now , governor kasich most people ca n't get a college degree without going into debt over 40 million americans have student loans and many of them cannot pay them back this country has over 100 billion in student loan defaults that s billion with a b what will you do to make sure that students , their families , taxpayers , wo n't feel the economic impact of this burden for generations \? well , first of all , in ohio we 're changing the whole system universities will not get paid one dime unless the student graduates or graduates or completes a course secondly , you can be in high school and complete almost an entire first year before you go to college and get credit to do that and , of course , in addition to that , we are working now to go after the cost drivers in our universities and let me give you an example universities today have so many nonacademic assets at ohio state they sold the parking garage and the parking lot , and they got 500 million because they should n't be in the parking lot business they should n't be in the ding business , they should n't be in the dorm business and , of course , we need to take advantage of online education to reduce these costs and begin to disintermediate the cost of four years now , for those who that have these big high costs , i think we can seriously look at an idea of where you can do public service i mean legitimate , public service and begin to pay off some of that debt through the public service that you do and in the meantime , it may inspire us to care more about our country , more about ourselves this is a big moral issue in america living a life bigger than yourself , and being a center of healing and justice and people can learn it through public service epperson thank you , thank you bush we do n't need the federal government to be involved in this at all quick higher education is the example bush we do n't need the federal government to be involved in this , because when they do we create a 12 trillion debt in florida , we have the lowest instate tuition of any state , because there s accountability , just as john said let the states do this you 'll create a much better graduation rate at a lower cost , and you wo n't in debt the next generation with recourse debt on their backs it s always a solution of the left to create more government from the federal government it is broke , it is not working \( crosstalk \) quintanilla governor bush , daily fantasy sports has become a phenomenon in this country , will award billions of dollars in prize money this year but to play you have to assess your odds , put money at risk , wait for an outcome that s out of your control is n't that the definition of gambling , and should the federal government treat it as such \? bush well , first of all , i'm 7 and 0 in my fantasy league quintanilla i had a feeling you were going to brag about that bush gronkowski is still going strong i have ryan tannehill , marco , as my quarterback , he was 18 for 19 last week so i'm doing great but we 're not gambling and i think this has become something that needs to be looked at in terms of regulation effectively it is day trading without any regulation at all and when you have insider information , which apparently has been the case , where people use that information and use big data to try to take advantage of it , there has to be some regulation if they ca n't regulate themselves , then the nfl needs to look at just , you know , moving away from them a little bit and there should be some regulation i have no clue whether the federal government is the proper place , my instinct is to say , hell no , just about everything about the federal government \( crosstalk \) christie carl , are we really talking about getting government involved in fantasy football \? \( laughter \) we have wait a second , we have 19 trillion in debt we have people out of work we have isis and al qaeda attacking us and we 're talking about fantasy football \? can we stop \? \( applause \) christie how about this \? how about we get the government to do what they 're supposed to be doing , secure our borders , protect our people , and support american values and american families enough on fantasy football let people play , who cares \? \( crosstalk \) quick i want to go back , if i can , to the issue of \( crosstalk \) quick i want to go back , if i may , to the harwood governor christie , you 've said something that many in your party do not believe , which is that climate change is undeniable , that human activity contributes to it , and you said , quote the question is , what do we do to deal with it \? so what do we do \? christie well , first off , what we do n't do is do what hillary clinton and john kerry and barack obama want us to do , which is their solution for everything , put more taxes on it , give more money to washington , dc , and then they will fix it well , there is no evidence that they can fix anything in washington , dc harwood what should we do \? christie what we should do is to be investing in all types of energy , john , all types of energy i 've laid out harwood you mean government \? christie no , john john , do you want me to answer or do you want to answer \? \( laughter \) how are we going to do this \? \( applause \) because , i 've got to tell you the truth , even in new jersey what you 're doing is called rude so \( laughter \) we 've laid out a national energy plan that says that we should invest in all types of energy i will tell you , you could win a bet at a bar tonight , since we 're talking about fantasy football , if you ask who the top three states in america are that produce solar energy california and arizona are easy , but number three is new jersey why \? because we work with the private sector to make solar energy affordable and available to businesses and individuals in our state we need to make sure that we do everything across all kinds of energy natural gas , oil , absolutely but also where it s affordable , solar , wind in iowa has become very affordable and it makes sense that is the way we deal with global warming , climate change , or any of those problems , not through government intervention , not through government taxes , and for god s sake , do n't send washington another dime until they stop wasting the money they 're already sending there harwood thank you , governor \( applause \) harwood becky quick senator paul , among the leading conservative opponents to the creation of medicare back in the 1960s was ronald reagan he warned that it would lead to socialism considering the mounting cost of medicare , was he right to oppose it \? paul the question always is , what works better , the private marketplace or government \? and what distributes goods better \? it always seems to be the private marketplace does a better job is there an area for a safety net \? can you have medicare or social security \? yes but you ought to acknowledge the government does n't do a very good job at it the main problem with medicare right now is that the average person pays in taxes over their whole lifetime about 100 , 000 but the average person takes out about 350 , 000 we have this enormous mismatch because we have smaller and smaller families when people ask me , whose fault is it \? whose fault is it that medicare is broken , out of money , that social security is broken , out of money \? and i say , look , it s not republicans' fault , it s not democrats' fault , it s your grandparents' fault for having too many damn kids \( laughter \) after the war we had all of these kids , baby boomers now we 're having smaller families we used to have 16 workers for one retiree , now you have three workers for one retiree it s not working i have a bill to fix medicare i 've a bill to fix social security for both of them you have to gradually raise the age if you 're not willing to do that , nobody wants to do it , but if you 're not willing to gradually raise the age , you 're not serious about fixing either one of them quick senator , thank you unidentified male becky , may i quintanilla this is the well , we 're going to take a break we want to save time for closing statements after the break so this is the republican presidential debate in boulder , and we 'll be right back \( commercial break \) \( applause \) quick welcome back to boulder , colorado and the republican presidential debate right here on cnbc governor huckabee , you wanted to respond to the points that senator rand paul was just making when it comes to social security your time , sir huckabee well , and specifically to medicare , becky , because 85 percent of the cost of medicare is chronic disease the fact is if we do n't address what s costing so much , we ca n't throw enough money at this and it s why i 've continued to focus on the fact that we need to declare war on the four big cost drivers because 80 percent of all medical costs in this country are chronic disease we do n't have a health care crisis in america , we have a health crisis and until we deal with the health of americans and do what we did with polio when i was a little kid , we eradicated it you know how much money we spent on polio last year in america \? we did n't spend any we 've saved billions of dollars you want to fix medicare \? focus on the diseases that are costing us the trillions of dollars alzheimers , diabetes , heart disease and cancer eradicate those and you fix medicare and you 've fixed america , its economy and you 've made people s lives a heck of a lot better bush becky quick thank you , governor \( applause \) bush the governor s absolutely right but we also need to reform medicare and social security we ca n't just allow it to continue on its current path the way that hillary clinton wants to do because there 'll be major reductions in benefits in the next decade if we do nothing i have a concrete plan to do just that , which allows people to keep hsas to encourage savings , it allows for people that are retiring with social security to be able to get a minimum of 125 percent of the poverty level so that there is a baseline that in this generous country of ours no one goes below harwood governor bush , mr trump says that he is capable of growing the economy so much that social security and medicare do n't have to be touched do you want to explain how that is going to happen , mr trump \? trump yes , it s very simple we 're going to make a really dynamic economy from what we have right now , which is not at all dynamic we 're going to bring jobs back from japan , we 're going to bring jobs back from china , we 're going to bring , frankly , jobs back from mexico where , as you probably saw , nabisco is leaving chicago with one of their biggest plants , and they 're moving it to mexico we 're going to bring jobs and manufacturing back we 're going to cut costs we 're going to save social security , and we 're going to save medicare \( unknown \) governor , you just heard him bush you have to reform social security , and the simple way to do it is to make sure that the wealthiest do n't receive the same benefits as people that are lowerincome and make sure you enhance savings in the private market the idea of 401 \( k \) s i have a small business that i set up it took it took an arm and a leg to be able to set up a 401 \( k \) because of all the federal mandates and federal laws , it was too expensive we need to incent private savings and make sure that social security is protected for those that have it kasich john bush but the idea that you ca n't that you 're just gonna grow your way out of this i have a plan to grow the economy at 4 percent , but you 're gonna have to make adjustments for both medicare and social security \( unknown \) governor kasich , do you want 30 seconds \? kasich i wanna tell you , in my state , we took medicaid , the hardest program to control , and we took it from a 10 percent growth rate to 25 percent without taking one person off the rolls or cutting one single benefit and so much of what we did to force competition , to use technology , to stand down the special interest groups can you imagine taking medicaid from 10 to 25 percent \? we can take many of those same procedures , we can apply it to medicare we can make a stronger program but i agree with jeb , you ca n't just do this by growing the economy you ca n't grow your way out of demographics but we can give people better health care and finally , on health care , why do n't we start treating keep giving quick governor kasich incentives for people to keep people healthy , rather than giving the incentives to treat them when they 're sick \? quick governor , thank you senator paul , let s go back to you do these solutions sound like they work \? paul say again \? quick do these solutions sound like they would work \? paul you ca n't do nothing and that s what i hear from some people , we 'll do nothing and it will just be fixed that s absurd , and i think people who do n't want to fix it , really , or unwilling to take the chance to say , something has to change , are missing the boat here the age will have to gradually rise , there is no question it s the only way you fix medicare , the only way you fix social security you will also have to meanstest the benefits and declare there s not enough money it is n't i put money in , i'm getting it back there is no money , it s a stack of paper there is no money in the social security account there is no money in the medicare account there s only a promise to pay by the next generation , and the next generation s not big enough to pay it \( crosstalk \) \( unknown \) to deal with this we did it 200 days ago harwood hold on , governor i 've got a question for for dr carson carson about medicare \? harwood yes you 've said that you would like to replace medicare with a system of individual family savings accounts , so that families could cover their own expenses obviously , that would be a very controversial idea explain how that would work , exactly carson well , first of all the the plan gives people the option of of opting out but i think they will see a very good option here you know , the annual medicare budget is over 600 billion and there are 48 million people involved 40 million , 65 and over , and 8 million other divide that out that comes out to 12 , 500 for each one now , i can tell you there are a lot of privatesector things that you could do with 12 , 500 , which will get you a lot more than you get from this government program and that s really a theme of a lot of the things that i'm talking about how do we utilize our intellect rather than allowing the government to use its , quote , intellect , in order to help us to be able to live healthier and better lives \? it was never intended that the government should be in every aspect of our lives this is a country that is of , for and by the people quick thank you , dr carson governor \? christie and and and i you know , ben is absolutely right in saying that what we do n't need to do is to send more money to washington , dc to fix this problem and that s what you 'll hear from hillary clinton and i 've already heard from her is that , send more money in social security , send more money in medicare taxes , send more money for medicaid , and that s gonna solve the problem what we know is we 're living longer that s a blessing it s a blessing that we 're living longer , so we have to increase the retirement age to reflect that blessing we need to make sure that people understand , as jeb said before , that if you 've done extraordinarily well in this country , do you want them to take more out of your taxes now and think they 're gonna give it back to you later \? or would you rather take less later on \? quintanilla senator rubio harwood governor , do you also think that quintanilla yeah , i just wanted \( inaudible \) harwood that dr carson s right , that we can replace medicare with individual savings accounts \? rubio no no what i said was that i think that dr carson s ideas are good ideas they 're not my ideas , and i do n't necessarily agree with all of them but this is what you 're seeing in the republican debate that you did n't see in that democrat debate you did n't see it for a minute you did n't see these kind of ideas being batted around , and being batted around in a way that s civil and smart and that s trying to help to inform the voter out there what you saw was a parade of , i 'll give you this for free i 'll give you that for free let me tell you , everybody , when they say they want to give it to you for free , keep your hands on your wallets because they 're coming to you to pay for it and that s why i think these ideas up here are great , and that s what we should have is have more discussions like this and less gotcha \( crosstalk \) quintanilla i want to give you 30 seconds here rubio i want to take off from that point and argue the same thing and that is that one of the things you 're watching tonight are 11 quality candidates debating an important issue the republican party is blessed to have 11 good candidates , \( inaudible \) 10 good candidates the democrats ca n't even come up with one and on this issue of the medicare in particular , it s important because they 're going to demagogue what we 're saying here tonight everyone up here tonight that s talking about reforms , i think and i know for myself i speak to this , we 're all talking about reforms for future generations nothing has to change for current beneficiaries my mother is on medicare and social security i'm against anything that s bad for my mother \( laughter \) so , we 're talking about we 're talking about reform for people like me and people like senator cruz , as he talked about earlier , who are years away from retirement that have a way to plan for these changes , and way that s very reasonable and it s not too much to ask of our generation after everything our parents and our grandparents did for us fiorina john , i if i a lot of people have jumped in here i 'd like to jump in a lot of people have jumped in here harwood mrs fiorina , we 're right at the end of our time fiorina i understand harwood you all wanted us to limit \( inaudible \) all right go ahead fiorina i would just say that \( laughter \) i would just say this , we 've heard a lot of great ideas up here , and i agree with what senator rubio said every election we talk about this every election we talk about medicare and social security reform it never happens i would like to start with a basic let us actually go to zero based budgeting so we know where the money is being spent it s kind of basic there is a bill sitting in the house that would actually pass and have us go to zerobased budgeting so we know where every dime of your money is being spent instead of only talking about how much more we 're going to spend year after year after year my point is this while there are lots of good ideas for reform , we have never tackled the basics and we finally need to tackle the basics to cut this government down to size and hold it accountable so let s start by knowing where your money is being spent by the federal government harwood we have now reached the point in the program where candidates are going to give their closing statements , 30 seconds apiece we 're going to go right to left and start with you , senator paul paul liberty thrives when government is small i want a government so small i can barely see it i want a government so small that the individual has a chance to thrive and prosper i think , though , government is too big now and what you 're going to see in washington this week is establishment republicans have made an agreement with the president to raise the debt ceiling in an unlimited fashion no limit to the debt ceiling raise this is extraordinary it s extraordinarily wrong you 'll see me on the floor of the senate tomorrow filibustering this and saying enough is enough , no more debt harwood governor christie \? christie i want to talk to the folks at home i want to ask you are you fed up with how washington taxes you \? are you fed up with how washington wastes your money \? are you concerned like i am that the debt and deficits of washington , dc are endangering america s future \? i 've got one more question for you then are you serious about this election \? because if you are , you need to elect someone who s deadly serious about changing this culture i am deadly serious about changing this culture i changed it in new jersey i'm deadly serious about doing this job the right way i'm prepared i'm tested i'm ready and i want to make this our government for the people who say we ca n't do it , i say hell no , we can do it together harwood thank you , governor senator cruz \? cruz you know , everyone here talks about the need to take on washington the natural next question is who actually has done so who actually has stood up not just to democrats , but to leaders in our own party \? when millions of americans rose up against obamacare , i was proud to lead that fight when millions of americans rose up against amnesty , i was proud to lead that fight when millions of americans rose up against planned parenthood , i was proud to lead that fight if people are promising they 're going to take on washington and cronyism , you need to look to who has been doing it in my family , my dad fled oppression in cuba to come to america freedom is personal for me , and i will always keep my word and fight for freedom harwood thank you , senator mrs fiorina \? fiorina you know , every election we hear a lot of talk we hear a lot of good plans we hear actually a lot of good intentions but somehow for decades , nothing really has changed what we need now is a proven leader who has produced results that s how you go from secretary to ceo you lead and you produce results i will cut this government down to size and hold it accountable , simplify the tax code , roll back the regulations that have been spewing out of washington , dc for 50 years i may not be your dream candidate just yet , but i can assure you i am hillary clinton s worst nightmare and in your heart of hearts , you cannot wait to see a debate between hillary clinton and carly fiorina i will tell you this , i will beat hillary clinton and with your vote and your support and your prayers , i will lead with the citizens of this great nation the resurgence of this great nation harman thank you , mrs fiorina dr carson \? carson i just want to thank all my colleagues here for being civil , and not falling for the traps and , i also just want to thank the audience for being attentive , and noticing the questions , and the noticing the answers and , this is what i am finding throughout america people are waking up because it is going to be us who will determine the direction of our country and , it was made for we the people , we are the ones who decide who we are , and we should never give away the values and principles that made america into a great nation for the sake of political correctness \( applause \) harwood mr trump \? trump our country does n't win anymore we used to win , we do n't win anymore we lose on trade we lose with isis we lose with one of the worst deals i 've ever seen negotiated of any kind , that s our recent catastrophe with iran we do n't win let me give you one quick example these folks , cnbc , they had it down at three , three and a half hours i just read today in the new york times , 250 , 000 for a 30 second ad i went out and said , it s ridiculous nobody i could stand up here all night nobody wants to watch three and a half , or three hours it was a back sacrifice , and i have to hand it to ben we called ben , he was with me 100 we called in , we said , that s it we 're not doing it they lost a lot of money , everybody said it could n't be done everybody said it was going to be three hours , three and a half , including them , and in about two minutes i renegotiated it so we can get the hell out of here not bad \( applause \) trump and , i 'll do that with the country we will make america great again and , thank you everybody just for the record harwood just for the record , the debate was always going to be two hours senator rubio \? trump that s not right that is absolutely not right you know that that is not right male thank you harwood senator rubio rubio you know , america does n't owe me anything i have a debt to america i 'll never repay this is n't just the country i was born in , this is the nation that literally changed the history of my family my parents in this country were able to give me the chance to do all the things they never did we call that the american dream , although , it s built on the universal dream of a better life the fact that it s happened for so many people here throughout our history , that s what makes us special but , now for millions of americans , it s slipping away and , we have a government and leaders in government that are completely out of touch , and that s why i'm running for president because we ca n't just save the american dream , we can expand it to reach more people , and change more lives than ever before and , that s why tonight i'm asking you for your vote harwood thank you , senator governor bush \? bush america s at a crossroads the dc politicians continue to make things worse i have a proven record of success , 32 years in business , and 8 years as governor of the state of florida i will change the culture in washington , just as i changed the culture in tallahassee i will do so in a way that will bring people together we need a unifier , not a cynical divider in chief , and that s exactly what i will do imagine a country where people are lifted out of poverty again imagine a country where the middle class can get rising income again i know we can do this because we 're still the most extraordinary country on the face of the earth harwood thank you , governor governor huckabee huckabee you know , i know to a lot of people in the media , this is just a great big game , and we 're the players and , we come out here , and we do our thing and , sometimes we 're held up in contempt by people who write columns , but , i guarantee you to every person on this stage there s something deep inside of us that would cause us to give up our livelihoods and step out on this stage and fight for the people of america i 've got five grandkids i do not want to walk my five grandkids through the charred remains of a once great country called america , and say , here you go , 20 trillion dollars of debt good luck making something out of this mess and , for those of us who are serious enough to run for president , think long and hard why we 're here , and hopefully you 'll know we 're not here for ourselves we honest to god are here to get this country back on track i know this , i certainly am harwood thank you huckabee thank you harwood governor kasich \?

bangkok the crown property bureau , which manages the thai royal family s properties and investments , controls assets that may amount to as much as 19 trillion baht , about 53 billion it is the biggest corporate group in the country and one of the biggest landholders in the capital it is also one of the more mysterious arms of the thai government the agency was created in 1936 and remained under civilian supervision until 1948 , a period of ascendancy for royalists , when control was handed to the crown little is known about how it spends its money it does not make its financial statements public six of its seven managers are appointed by the king although the finance minister chairs its board , the government exercises no oversight over its operations the crown property bureau s annual returns today probably near 840 million \( assuming its portfolio is managed according to best investment practices , with onethird held in lowrisk assets such as cash , bank deposits , bonds and government securities \) it holds more than 21 percent in siam commercial bank , thailand s oldest and most influential bank , and 30 percent in siam cement group , the country s biggest industrial conglomerate its equity wing has a controlling stake in the luxury hotel group kempinski and minority stakes in the thailandbased subsidiaries of honda and other japanese manufacturers , as well as in domestic firms that run shopping malls , hotels , insurance businesses and fastfood chains by law , the crown property bureau s annual income may be disposed of at the king s pleasure its returns are taxexempt in other words , the crown property bureau is an antiquated institution of entrenched privilege that operates largely in secret beyond the purview of the government this is inconsistent with a modern society the agency must be reformed , for the sake of both the country and the monarchy itself with thailand increasingly paralyzed by a political struggle between liberal and reactionary camps , modernizing the crown property bureau would distinguish the palace as an agent for progress the agency s prestige and market power make it a formidable broker of economic opportunities , especially in bangkok and among traditional elites like the military , big business and the royalists it owns five square miles of prime real estate in the capital but it rents out 93 percent of these properties below market rates , suggesting that it treats these transactions as special favors the united states government , for example , is said to pay the equivalent of a single ticket for a broadway play in monthly rent for a lavish residence in central bangkok such practices must change for starters , the crown property bureau should publish annual reports detailing its investments , land holdings and other assets , as well as its earnings from these assets , the use to which it puts those earnings and its operational costs the agency should be placed under the control of officials appointed by an elected government as is the case in britain , norway , the netherlands and other constitutional monarchies , the agency would be funded solely through the annual budget approved by parliament the government , in conjunction with the palace , would decide the level of that financial support it should also decide how to spend the crown property bureau s dividends the agency s earnings should be partly reinvested and partly handed over to the thai treasury none should remain directly at the disposal of the royal family consistent with the law that applies to firms in thailand , these earnings should be subject to tax the crown property bureau s ostensible goal today is to make investments that support thailand s development this , too , must be abandoned it is an objective best left to the government instead , the agency should aim to achieve high returns at an acceptable risk , meaning that it should diversify its assets rather than make investments that broker opportunities for the monied classes the agency s excessive shareholdings in banking and industry must be gradually reduced , say , to 5 percent lifting the secrecy that shrouds the operations of the crown property bureau and placing it back under the control of the government would signal that the thai monarchy is serious about transparency such a reform would send an important message of accountability to the military , politicians and businesspeople , and pave the way for an open economic system , the only kind that is truly compatible with democracy
buffalo they were pushed , prodded , measured , weighed and otherwise subjected to a kind of scrutiny familiar to anyone who has inspected produce before buying but in this case , the commodities were teenagers , the top drafteligible hockey prospects in the world , who last week were examined and tested physically and mentally at the 2015 nhl scouting combine here at harborcenter , part of a tworink hockey complex completed in 2014 by the host sabres for the first time in its history , the combine moved from the toronto area , where it had been held the last several years in a crowded ballroom in mississauga , ontario there were other changes , too physical testing took place over two days , friday and saturday , instead of one and new tests were added , all designed to mimic skills better suited for hockey yet the basic purpose of the combine did not change it was an opportunity for teams to better predict the professional potential of a group , made up mostly of 18yearolds , based on their body types , quickness , agility , stamina and attitude no player has to prove anything , because this is not a competition , said dan marr , the nhl s director for central scouting , while describing the three components of the combine medical screening , personal interviews and physical testing yet the environment and the personalities of the participants invite comparison , from the news media , the fans and the scouts they try to tell us it s not a competition , but we 're all naturally pretty competitive , so we want to do our best , said noah hanifin , a and the player ranked third in the draft class by nhl central scouting they will push us to our limits , and whatever happens , happens much of the interest focused on jack eichel , a 6foot2 , 194pound and the secondranked player in the draft i was looking at the scoreboard , eichel said , explaining how he had followed the test results , posted on monitors on the arena floor he added , it s in anybody s competitive nature to want to top all the scores for more than a year , eichel has been compared relentlessly to connor mcdavid , who played for the erie otters in the ontario hockey league the last three seasons the analysis only intensified throughout the week of the combine , when the two players had a chance to meet mcdavid is the topranked player in the draft it is thought that he and eichel can contribute immediately in the nhl next season edmonton is expected to select mcdavid first at the draft on june 26 at bbt center in sunrise , fla the sabres are expected to take eichel with the second pick last season mcdavid , who is six feet and 188 pounds , finished third in the ohl in scoring , with 120 points , despite having missed 21 games with an injury eichel led the ncaa with 71 points and won the hobey baker award as the nation s top college player he led the terriers to the ncaa final , where they lost to providence it s a fine line , marr said of ranking mcdavid over eichel , before citing mcdavid s quickness at processing and executing the game as deciding factors we actually feel the best is yet to come , that there s still room for growth for mcdavid , marr said earlier in the week , word leaked out that during private interviews with team staff members , eichel had told the sabres that he was the best player in the draft i'm pretty confident in my own abilities , eichel said when asked about it i know everyone is making a big deal that i said a comment like that that was n't me comparing myself to connor or anything like that it was just me thinking i'm the best player in the draft , more confidence in my own self i did n't think it was a big deal i thought it was confidential within the team mcdavid , who tends to be more softspoken , said it s not up to me to decide a lot of people will do a lot of talking , and they 'll judge with their own eyes i believe in my abilities , and i feel i'm the best player in the draft i'm not sure , maybe you 'll hear a different answer from jack when it came to testing this week , eichel was superior to mcdavid eichel bench press , pullups and agility , and vertical and standing broad jumps eichel s results ranked well against other prospects , too he had the best endurance result \( 12 minutes 15 seconds \) in a grueling test in which the prospects pedal a bike against stiff resistance while wearing an oxygen mask he ranked fifth in vertical jump , fourth in bench press and fifth in the standing broad jump , and he had the strongest righthand grip none of that will alter his or mcdavid s standings , which are cast things get more interesting with the next picks , starting with the arizona coyotes' selection in the third slot don maloney , arizona s general manager , was reluctant to reveal his hand he indicated that little of what had happened at the combine would determine his course early in the draft he did allow , though , that some of his team s later selections could be affected we have to tweak this , maloney said of his scouting staff s recommendations we 're not going to take a guy who was 20th on our list and jump him up on our list because he had a nice long jump and looked good in a tshirt that s not the way it works
antakya , turkey the cigarette smoke in the hotel room grew as thick as the cottony fog outside in this turkish border town , as syrian men , night after night , told their war stories their memories veered from exhilaration to black humor to terror , but mostly they told of what they had lost friends a fianc e an arm a country none were out of their mid20s three were insurgents , or had been one had helped capture an army tank another had hidden in tall grass as tank fire killed his raiding party they told of abandoning one insurgent group after another , finding commanders too violent , too corrupt , too disorganized , too pious , not pious enough three others , civilian antigovernment activists who broadcast war news on social media , were on the run from extremists for them , the fog was a comfort , shrouding their movements as they drove to the hotel they had trekked for days from the remote provincial capital of deir alzour , holding their breath at islamic state checkpoints , hoping to find safety here in southern  but they still felt hunted , sure that the group had eyes and ears everywhere , among bearded strangers in syrianrun cafes or in hotels welcoming foreign fighters they did not tell friends where they were staying , and they did not know when or whether they could go home not long ago , these men would have felt secure here early in the syrian conflict antakya , long a sleepy provincial town , became the highoctane hub of an insurgency that thought it was winning back then , young fighters and activists , including some of those recently huddling in the hotel room , filled cafes to brainstorm , dreaming of new power and new freedoms but some of those flocking to antakya would later become their enemies the city was becoming a way station for foreign jihadists , who spent lavishly , even spurring a market for talibanstyle dress they ultimately transformed s battlefield , many of them coalescing into the radical islamic state group , which routed or coopted other insurgents and shifted the west s focus from ousting president to countering the extremist group s momentum now , the group has turned violently against any assad opponents who fail to flock to its banner like the young men in the hotel room those men are part of what is looming as a lost generation of young syrians they are marooned in southern , unsure how to envision their future , and their hopes are deflating as rapidly as antakya s wartime boom the small sample of men who filed through the hotel room to talk discreetly to reporters were from syria s north , east and south , some of them old friends , like the three from deir alzour , others meeting for the first time yet all but one , a hardline islamist , had reached the point of wondering whether armed revolt or even the civil protest movement that preceded it had been a mistake i regret , said one civilian from deir alzour , a web designer and english literature graduate with a narrow , angular face and an intense gaze the best people in my country , they have been killed in this revolution the worst people have controlled the country and the goal of our revolution is not accomplished my best friends are dead , he went on we lost things his black ski jacket concealed the stump of his left arm he was hit by shrapnel while filming a battle , and drove to four hospitals in the desert province before finding one with doctors and supplies by then , his arm was unsalvageable later , when the islamic state took over his town , he said , the extremists gave him a choice put his media skills to work for them , or die i cannot see my family , he said , like most of the others , requesting anonymity for his safety besides , our beautiful country was destroyed one of his friends , who gave only a first name , hazem , said that some things he could never regret , like the thrill of his first protest , when his girlfriend whispered in his ear her excitement at defying the authorities \( she later married someone else because hazem s activities were too risky \) he long brushed away doubts , not wanting to betray his cause but what brought him to regret , he said , was the islamic state , also known as or isil , because it divided the rebellion , pitting brother against brother in battling other insurgents listening from the scratchy carpet was tarek fares , who had played a more direct role , fighting on the front lines but he flatly called the shift from protests to armed revolt a mistake it allowed the government to cast itself as fighting terrorism , he said , and sowed divisions among insurgents over arms and money the man who lost an arm shot back that , with security forces shooting protesters , we could not have won peacefully either a first sergeant in air force intelligence from southern syria , mr fares defected in 2011 and fled to turkey he made his way back to the damascus suburbs with arms for ahfad alrasoul , part of the looseknit , westernallied free syrian army but that group accused him of treachery for coordinating with other insurgents , their putative allies he and some friends switched to an islamist group but its leader , he said , was more interested in forcing them to pray than in fighting , and scolded them for dancing to in their makeshift barracks mr fares started his own group but because he and his fighters were not from the area , no one would sell them scarce food he disbanded the group , he said , after he could scrounge only a few pounds of lentils to feed 50 fighters now he belongs to no group \( he has worked occasionally as a guide for new york times reporters \) , and misses the lights and nightclubs of damascus the lone true believer the only one still taking part in battles belonged to a hardline islamist \( but antiislamic state \) group , ahrar alsham while he condemned the islamic state s leadership , he said its fighters embodied true jihad given this landscape , the other men said , many antiassad syrians are willing to hear out a proposed peace initiative from moscow , even though it could leave mr assad or much of his government in power a wide spectrum would accept a deal if he goes but his regime stays , hazem , from deir alzour , said syrians are bored of this humiliation and displacement such views have surprised some officials in the exile opposition coalition , who have dismissed moscow s proposal hazem s injured colleague said he expected little from moscow or the world asked how the war would end , he said simply , it will not end

yerevan , armenia thousands of armenians laid flowers around an eternal flame here on friday in memory of the 15 million people killed in ottoman a century ago the ceremony was one of many around the world marking the 100th anniversary of what historians call a genocide the legacy of those mass killings and forced deportations , , remains a source of bitter enmity and continues to roil politics in asia minor and beyond on an ashen gray day here in the armenian capital , president serzh sargsyan was joined by international delegations that included presidents vladimir v putin of russia and fran ois hollande of france at the tsitsernakaberd memorial complex , the main monument to the armenian genocide , on a hilltop overlooking the city mr sargsyan , in his opening remarks , described the killing of armenians as unprecedented in terms of volume and ramifications at that point in history the western part of the armenian people , who for millenniums had lived in their homeland , in the cradle of their civilization , were displaced and annihilated under a statedevised plan , mr sargsyan said , with direct participation of the army , police , other state institutions , and gangs comprising criminals released from the prisons specifically for this purpose around 15 million human beings were slaughtered merely for being armenian , he said the forced exiles that accompanied the killings in ottoman turkey transformed the armenians into one of the world s largest diaspora peoples estimated at up to 10 million people , more than three times s population many of the mourners in yerevan on friday had traveled from russia , iran , the united states and other countries with large armenian communities charles a hajinian , 61 , a dentist from delafield , wis , carried an aging blackandwhite photograph of his greatgrandmother i came to remember my greatgrandmother , my greatuncles , both my greatgrandparents died , my greatcousins , dr hajinian said , fighting back tears i came to say thank you to the armenians for surviving , fighting and putting this monument up gevorg tonoyan , 60 , an elevator technician , who was waiting with his 2 yearold granddaughter to enter the memorial complex , said whatever happens , we will not forget we will come , we will honor our victims , our martyrs in some cases , mourners expressed seething anger at the turks sona ghazaryan , 63 , a religion teacher , said , only at a time when our neighbor apologizes , washes their bloody hands and gives us back our treasures could there be reconciliation how can you be neighbor with someone if they have a dagger and wants to stab you in your back \? she said an increasing number of world leaders have endorsed s position that the mass killings in 1915 constitute a genocide turkey says it was a tragic outcome of a bloody war , but not a planned genocide we sincerely sympathize with the armenian people who suffered one of the most awful tragedies in the history of mankind , said mr putin , who decided to attend the ceremony in yerevan and eschew  the american delegation to yerevan was led by jacob j lew , the secretary of the treasury , and the white house referred to the ceremony friday as the centennial commemoration of the events of 1915 euphemistic enough perhaps to satisfy president recep tayyip erdogan of turkey , but a disappointment to armenians who had hoped mr obama would make good on his promise as a presidential candidate to recognize the killings as genocide in a new statement on friday , mr obama of armenians the first mass atrocity of the 20th century he also suggested that the absence of the word genocide in his statement was an official position , but not a reflection of his personal beliefs i have consistently stated my own view of what occurred in 1915 , and my view has not changed , mr obama said by now , with the facts well established , it is largely a semantic debate that turkey seems to be losing and even some people in turkey have called for recognition and reconciliation given the increasingly settled world opinion beyond the fight over the term genocide , the enmity between turkey and armenia still weighs heavily in both countries and is a major factor in regional politics the border between the two nations is sealed , in what amounts to an economic barrier for the entire region , and armenia remains officially at war with its other turkic muslim neighbor , azerbaijan , over the territory of nagornokarabakh at the memorial complex in yerevan , many armenians said they wanted turkey to acknowledge the genocide , as a matter of historical justice but none seemed to be holding their breath if you have a scab , a sore , and you keep picking at it , it will never heal , and that s the sad part of turkey , they are hurting themselves by not acknowledging , said dr hajinian , the dentist from wisconsin but for the rest of the world and for us , we know in our hearts what happened we do n't need the acknowledgment of turkey for our healing
dhaka , bangladesh the quickest way to grasp the nastiness of s season of political turmoil is to visit the high dependency unit at dhaka medical college hospital this is the ward for burn victims from roadside firebomb attacks , collateral damage from the long battle between bangladesh s , as the country s two most important political leaders are known on a recent morning , mohammad nazmul mollah looked down the row of beds at three men who had been riding beside him in a truck , after unloading a shipment of sand , when a firebomb thrown by a protester smashed through the windshield mr mollah , 25 , was the lucky one , having jumped out the passengerside window so quickly that his worst injuries were fractures to bones and kneecaps the eight men to his right were unlucky five died , and others came out with seared tracheas , faces stripped of skin , eyelids swollen to slits asked what he would say to the country s political leaders , he spoke dully they are killing ordinary people , he said they are killing their own brothers there are few in bangladesh who do not sound exhausted this spring the country was thrust into disarray in january , when the opposition leader declared an indefinite campaign of strikes and transport blockades , hoping to pressure her rival , prime minister sheikh hasina , into holding new national elections yet if mrs zia was expecting compromise , none came political tension relaxed in recent weeks , and life has largely returned to normal on dhaka s streets , but there is no longterm solution in sight among those watching closely were the country s leaders of industry a world bank report released on sunday showed that bangladesh s economy lost 22 billion , or around 1 percent of gross domestic product , as a result of 62 days of political unrest this year the report said the country s economic growth rate would be 56 percent this fiscal year compared with 66 percent the bank had predicted before the strikes began how long can you remain resilient if day after day , year after year , you keep hurting industry \? , said in an interview eventually the ability to recoup is affected the violence can be traced to nationwide elections in january 2014 , which set off a battle of wills between the two ladies mrs zia , a former prime minister whose bangladesh nationalist party , or bnp , leads a 20party opposition alliance , threatened to boycott the polls , suggesting that they would be rigged in the government s favor mrs hasina called her bluff and held an election that excluded the alliance , issuing vague promises of repeat elections in the coming months this january , after a year of waiting , mrs zia declared an indefinite protest campaign more than 100 bangladeshis have died , and many more have been horribly injured , in roadside bombings by blocking highways , often violently , the protesters targeted the weakest link in the supply chain the government has responded with increasingly harsh measures , and many of mrs zia s party leaders either have been arrested or are in hiding bnp officials deny responsibility for the violence but say they had no option besides blockades and strikes i saw the agonies of the burned people , their maimed bodies , the smell of burning flesh , acknowledged mahbubur rahman , a retired army general and member of the bnp s national standing committee but what we say is that the government is not allowing us to talk not allowing us to assemble not allowing us to protest , to make our news in this situation , where the democratic rights are denied , what else can we do \? the campaign hurt the entire country students whose schools shut down before examinations farmers who watched their crops rot tourist resorts reporting neartotal vacancy but no sector matters as much as the garment industry , which accounts for 80 percent of bangladesh s exports and faces stiff competition from factories in cambodia and vietnam shabbir mahmood , who has two plants that employ 820 workers , felt the damage immediately of the four companies that regularly give him orders , two canceled their january buying visits out of security concerns orders for february and march fell to half the plants' capacity , leaving him no choice but to furlough workers this made it all the more vital to guarantee prompt deliveries for his remaining buyers yet he did not have the heart to order terrified drivers to haul goods to the nearest port in chittagong , a 160mile journey that takes six hours under normal circumstances they came to me and said , sir , how will we drive \? how will we go across the road if they try throwing bombs \? ' mr mahmood said , and he shrugged i can give them money , but i cannot give them their lives back in the end , he paid out of pocket to send two or three shipments by air mr mahmood has delayed the planned fall opening of a third factory , this one to employ 2 , 000 workers if the strikes continue , he will delay again though manufacturers have lobbied both mrs zia and mrs hasina to pursue a negotiated settlement for the sake of the economy , he said , they have had no success who will care \? the government will not care , mr mahmood said textile people always tell them this , but they do not care government officials , and some economists , say the economy is resilient enough to weather moderate political strife , and note that the biggest garment businesses managed to move their cargo to port in a timely fashion through the worst violence , in january and february still , the disruptions have compounded problems that resulted from the 2013 collapse of the garment factory on the outskirts of dhaka , which claimed more than 1 , 100 lives factories are straining to comply with new safety and wage standards , and to rebuild investor confidence in bangladesh if the turmoil resumes in the second quarter , forecasters with the bangladesh garment manufacturers and exporters association say , exports could fall 25 to 30 percent starting in may khurrum siddique , director of simco dresses ltd , a manufacturer based in a suburb north of dhaka , described the political uncertainty as a disaster , a manmade disaster he said his company was reconsidering plans for investment this year we have no ethnic , linguistic or sectarian problems in bangladesh , especially compared to pakistan or india , mr siddique said i do n't understand why this issue ca n't be solved over a cup of tea for garment workers , a large number of them women , the stakes are also high in the mirpur neighborhood of dhaka , where workers sleep five to a rented room , many are already complaining of lost overtime , saying their workday now ends around 4 or 5 pm instead of 9 or 10 this is no small matter , since rent and food eat up nearly all of their base monthly pay of around 6 , 000 taka , or about 77 ask what they would do if manufacturers began laying off workers , and the answer is sobering most were landless villagers , and workers said they would have few options beyond day labor for 50 taka , or about 65 cents , a day women in the villages rarely bring in income , so they are heavily reliant on their husbands , and many say they would not consider returning until they could open their own businesses if i go back to the village with empty hands , with no savings , it would be the worst thing in my life , said momena akhter , 30 one of her neighbors , mahmuda khatun , 55 , said she had no doubt who would be to blame if the industry entered a downturn the government is responsible for all these things , ms khatun said , a fist planted on her hip i will tell them you are responsible i will blame them i will say it is because of you that all of this is happening
opening day brings the smell of newly mowed grass , the resumption of peanut devouring and the crack of wood on leather only this year , there was not all that much crack here are the runs scored by the losing teams in monday s openers \( as well as the single game sunday night \) 4 , 3 , 2 , 2 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 four of the losing teams were limited to three hits , and the managed just one hit against sonny gray \( 19 career wins \) and evan scribner \( one career save \) of the  that s a lot of offensive futility as tyler kepner baseball is mired in an offensive slump even with some of the winning teams showing offensive muscle the and the scored 10 runs each , the a s and the eight the teams scored an average of just 327 runs on opening day this year the rangers stood out , failing to get a hit against gray until ryan rua singled in the eighth inning designated hitter mitch moreland hit into a double play immediately after the rangers did get three other runners to first in the game on a walk , an error and a hit by pitch there were numerous other poor team performances the got a double from ryan howard in an 80 loss to the red sox , but got only one other man to second all game , and no one further the had just three singles and never got the ball out of the infield when a man was on base and that was against the , who were 7092 last year one common theme was an inability to string together hits for sustained rallies four of the five teams that scored only one run did it on solo homers , by brett gardner , mike trout of the , jose abreu of the and bryce harper of the nationals despite being trumpeted as the world series favorite , washington and none against four met relievers while it is true that teams often roll out their best pitchers on opening day , that alone cannot explain the drought none of the six shutouts were a complete game , and several winning teams used three or even four pitchers it is a little too soon to panic though important , opening day is only one day scoring also typically drops in april and september , when temperatures are lower and teams have 161 more games to prove that they remember how to hit but if baseball administrators and fans are concerned about run scoring , the sport s first showpiece day did nothing to reassure
many economists , including janet yellen , view global economic troubles since 2008 largely as a story about deleveraging a simultaneous attempt by debtors almost everywhere to reduce their liabilities why is deleveraging a problem \? because my spending is your income , and your spending is my income , so if everyone slashes spending at the same time , incomes go down around the world or in 2009 , precautions that may be smart for individuals and firms and indeed essential to return the economy to a normal state nevertheless magnify the distress of the economy as a whole so how much progress have we made in returning the economy to that normal state \? none at all you see , policy makers have been basing their actions on a false view of what debt is all about , and their attempts to reduce the problem have actually made it worse first , the facts last week , the mckinsey global institute issued a report titled , which found , basically , that no nation has reduced its ratio of total debt to gdp household debt is down in some countries , especially in the united states but it s up in others , and even where there has been significant private deleveraging , government debt has risen by more than private debt has fallen you might think our failure to reduce debt ratios shows that we are n't trying hard enough that families and governments have n't been making a serious effort to tighten their belts , and that what the world needs is , yes , more austerity but we have , in fact , had unprecedented austerity as has pointed out , real government spending excluding interest has fallen across wealthy nations there have been deep cuts by the troubled debtors of southern europe , but there have also been cuts in countries , like germany and the united states , that can borrow at some of the lowest interest rates in history all this austerity has , however , only made things worse and predictably so , because demands that everyone tighten their belts were based on a misunderstanding of the role debt plays in the economy you can see that misunderstanding at work every time someone rails against deficits with slogans like it sounds right , if you do n't think about it families who run up debts make themselves poorer , so is n't that true when we look at overall national debt \? no , it is n't an indebted family owes money to other people the world economy as a whole owes money to itself and while it s true that countries can borrow from other countries , america has actually been borrowing less from abroad since 2008 than it did before , and europe is a net lender to the rest of the world because , it does not directly make the economy poorer \( and paying it off does n't make us richer \) true , debt can pose a threat to financial stability but the situation is not improved if efforts to reduce debt end up pushing the economy into deflation and depression which brings us to current events , for there is a direct connection between the overall failure to deleverage and the emerging political crisis in europe european leaders completely bought into the notion that the economic crisis was brought on by too much spending , by nations living beyond their means the way forward , chancellor angela merkel of germany insisted , was a return to frugality europe , she declared , should emulate the famously thrifty  this was a prescription for slowmotion disaster european debtors did , in fact , need to tighten their belts but the austerity they were actually forced to impose was incredibly savage meanwhile , germany and other core economies which needed to spend more , to offset belttightening in the periphery also tried to spend less the result was to create an environment in which reducing debt ratios was impossible real growth slowed to a crawl , inflation fell to almost nothing and outright deflation has taken hold in the worsthit nations suffering voters put up with this policy disaster for a remarkably long time , believing in the promises of the elite that they would soon see their sacrifices rewarded but as the pain went on and on , with no visible progress , radicalization was inevitable anyone surprised by the left s victory in greece , or the surge of , has n't been paying attention nobody knows what happens next bookmakers are still giving that greece will stay in the euro but if it does n't , i do n't believe the damage would stop there a greek exit is all too likely to threaten the whole currency project and if the euro does fail , here s what should be written on its tombstone died of a bad analogy
atlanta it was a long way down for the on sunday carolina , a team that routinely , some say excessively , prances about the sidelines in celebration , finally felt the sting of a loss after 14 straight wins this season losses are not taken easily around the nfl , but the panthers' locker room was unusually subdued , as if the music were accidentally halted at the height of a party the panthers were sideswiped in their bid to be the first 190 nfl team , losing to the atlanta falcons , 2013 , before an announced crowd of 70 , 981 at the georgia dome the falcons' defense held the nfl s topscoring offense \( 321 points a game \) to one touchdown , and quarterback matt ryan s playaction passes , and an acrobatic touchdown reception by wide receiver julio jones , ended the panthers' run no one took the loss harder than carolina quarterback cam newton , who sat alone in front of his locker with his head bowed while his teammates gave postgame interviews newton finally walked to a lectern to talk to the news media an hour after the game he took his share of the blame he said that the panthers had been beaten badly and that to a high degree , we deserved it newton added i'm talking with the mirror in front of my face that s unacceptable , especially this time of the year we have to be jelling and meshing the panthers ripped the falcons , 380 , just two weeks ago in charlotte , but carolina coach ron rivera insisted that his team had not taken atlanta \( 87 \) lightly just disappointing , rivera said of the loss we did n't play very well carolina will host tampa bay next week as the panthers try to lock up homefield advantage throughout the nfc playoffs the panthers played without their leading rusher , jonathan stewart , who missed his second straight game with a sprained foot more of the burden on offense fell to newton , who was 17 for 30 passing for just 142 yards carolina converted 4 of 10 thirddown opportunities but was just 2 for 8 after its first possession of the game carolina , which had 10 players named to the pro bowl last week , took the opening kickoff and marched 80 yards in 11 plays , with newton finishing the drive with an 8yard touchdown run it appeared that another rout of atlanta was coming after he crossed the goal line , newton had a protracted end zone celebration , which included pretending to rock a baby in his arms the falcons had been insulted by newton s histrionics in their previous loss , and this display fueled even more resentment falcons linebacker o'brien schofield said the panthers had posed for a team picture and pranced in celebration with time remaining in that game it was very disrespectful to a lot of us , and it definitely sparked something for us , schofield said cam newton was running up and down the sidelines celebrating with the fans before it was over there were none of those antics today instead of antics , there was an acrobatic move by jones , a fifthyear wide receiver , who caught nine passes for 178 yards the falcons were trailing by 107 in the third quarter when ryan was forced left out of the pocket , motioned for jones to go deep and then threw the ball high down the sideline jones was sandwiched between linebacker luke kuechly and safety kurt coleman , but he leapt and reached over kuechly , snatching the ball with two hands he then turned and dashed down the sideline for a 70yard scoring play there were plenty of noisy carolina fans in the georgia dome , but it was finally apparent that this was a home game for atlanta as the falcons' fans erupted at their team s sudden 1410 lead i think i might have jumped a little too early , kuechly said ryan said of jones , i really do n't feel like there s anybody in the league who s better in that situation than him ryan finished with 23 completions on 30 attempts for 306 yards carolina pulled to 1413 on graham gano s 47yard field goal with 7 minutes 59 seconds left in the game atlanta s shayne graham kicked a 37yard field goal with 2 23 seconds remaining to make it 1713 newton had two chances to rally his team , but falcons defensive linemen vic beasley jr and ra shede hageman would not give newton any peace the panthers' first turn with the ball in the final period ended after six plays with carolina giving the ball up on downs at its 37 atlanta could have run all but 15 to 20 seconds off the clock , but in a bizarre sequence , the falcons stopped the clock by committing three penalties graham kicked a 54yard field goal to make it 2013 , but newton still had 1 30 to keep the unbeaten season alive but on the second play , newton was stripped of the ball by beasley it was recovered by defensive end adrian clayborn , and the panthers were denied their chance at a perfect season
nickelsdorf , austria austrian police officers found pungent fluid dripping from the back door of a meat truck that had been abandoned on a highway near the hungarian border counting the tangled and decomposing bodies inside took the authorities more than a day seventyone migrants , four of them children , suffocated within about 90 minutes after they squeezed into the truck s airless refrigeration chamber more than 24 hours earlier , investigators concluded the , riveted attention on the human tidal wave of migrants crashing into europe it raised questions about both the cruelty of the smugglers and the desperation of their clients the 71 deaths remained shrouded in mystery all but a handful of the migrants had traveled without passports in the hope of starting new lives , and the austrian police have waited to match fingerprints or dna samples the authorities have so far confirmed the identities of only about half the dead migrants originally from the cities of qamishli and deir alzour in syria , and erbil and sulaimaniya in iraq s kurdistan region the migrants did not start out helpless or na ve , their families say in interviews in six cities across turkey , iraq and austria , the families of more than a dozen of the dead said that many of the migrants were affluent and educated they paid to mitigate the risks of the journey , and they died with money in their pockets the story of their deaths illustrates the manipulations that smugglers use to exploit the psychology of even the most resourceful migrants , leaving them far more desperate and vulnerable than when they began almost all their relatives insisted , despite the evidence , that the migrants knew better than to get into the back of a crowded truck even a truck that was better ventilated it is impossible , said hassan khalid , 30 , a syrian from qamishli now living in erbil , whose two brothers died in the truck the older of the brothers , hussein khalid , 34 , was an archaeology graduate student who wanted to reach germany to complete his doctorate and brought along a younger brother and a family friend he is well educated and very careful , and he talked to a lot of people who had made that trip , mr khalid said everyone agreed never get on a truck in internettelephone calls home , hussein told his family that he had insisted on a sturdy yacht instead of a raft to cross the mediterranean from turkey to greece , at a premium price of 1 , 800 per person he made his way from the boat to belgrade , serbia , without the help of any smuggler he sent home a photograph of himself lounging with his feet up in a belgrade bunkhouse where the three men were renting beds for 12 a night , and he left relaxed and confident audio messages for his family weighing whether to hire a smuggler for the final leg of their journey they hired one just to be safe , he told his family , to navigate the aggressive border security of the hungarian police the family said hussein paid about 1 , 800 a person to a smuggler named karwan elsulmani , who promised a passenger car ride all the way to germany hussein had about 4 , 300 left in his possession when he entered the truck , his brothers said more than 20 of the 71 dead migrants came from the oilrich kurdistan region of iraq , a relatively stable and prosperous area that remains a destination for job seekers from india , pakistan , africa and elsewhere several families there said that they had made advance payments of as much as 4 , 500 to a local smuggling agent working with mr sulmani the agent does business under the name jamal guarantee although none of the interviewed families of his dead migrant clients have recovered their initial payments to avoid the risk of a mediterranean passage , four friends from the same neighborhood of large , comfortable homes in sulaimaniya paid the smugglers an extra premium about 9 , 000 to 11 , 000 each to travel by land north from turkey through bulgaria we paid more to go the safe way , said jamal hussein , 49 , whose son shwan jamal hussein , 23 , died in the truck his father insisted that shwan had driven a truck himself and knew he could not survive it another of the four , osman mohamed , 35 , was a wellpaid employee at a telecommunications company who also owned his own mobile phone shop he wanted to go to germany for medical treatment for kidney stones , his family said we do n't have a problem with money , said his brother , bahman mohamed , 33 a third , zardasht mohamed abdulla , 28 , who also died in the truck , left behind a bus parked in front of his home that his family had bought him for 27 , 500 more than double the average annual income in kurdistan the four friends were detained at a camp in bulgaria for 26 days but continued on their journey with the same smugglers to belgrade the four sent home pictures of themselves smiling in sweaters in a lush serbian forest in serbia , they set their sights on germany , which is known for its generosity to asylum seekers they agreed to pay mr sulmani , the kurdish smuggler , an additional 680 each for a car ride to get there none of the smugglers answered phone calls seeking comment until this summer , smugglers typically charged migrants by the carload , as in a taxi , said gerald tatzgern , director of the human trafficking division of the austrian police normally a smuggler might have gotten 500 euros per car , he said , about 566 but with the exploding numbers this summer , smugglers began charging per head instead of per vehicle they said , what about 500 euros per person \? ' and the migrants opened up their rucksacks and paid ! mr tatzgern said this is a good business the economies of scale created an incentive to jam migrants into the back of illsuited freight vehicles , and the profitable work attracted street criminals with little experience they stopped shoplifting they stopped pickpocketing now they are smugglers , mr tatzgern said the police and migrants both say that smugglers who load the trucks now routinely hide the faces of the drivers that way the drivers can abandon the trucks without fear of identification so many freight trucks full of migrants have been making the journey across hungary that at least three others were discovered in the same 48 hours as the meat truck full of corpses a truck containing 86 migrants was stopped in germany , and the austrian police found one with 81 migrants and the other with about 25 , abandoned near the border with hungary , according to the police and migrants \( all survived \) all of the families interviewed said that they last spoke with the migrants on the evening of aug 25 , and that all had expected a car ride to germany the four friends from sulaimaniya had passed the previous night walking hours through a forest across the border from serbia to hungary osman mohamed , speaking by telephone from a hungarian forest , sounded exhausted and desperate , said his brother , bahman come back , forget about the money , ' bahman said he told osman , reminding him that the family had plenty but after paying extra to travel by land and spending four weeks detained in bulgaria , osman felt he had come too far already there is no way i am going back , he said , according to his brother even if the last way is by sea , i am going to take it ! psychologists say the impulse is understandable when you are deciding whether to leave your country or not , the idea of going into a poorly ventilated truck might seem absurd , stephen d reicher , a social psychologist at st andrews university , in scotland , wrote in an email it threatens an extreme loss \( of life \) when you are n't even convinced of the overall gain of leaving but when a migrant nears his destination , the choice becomes whether to fail , to have wasted all the efforts and risks involved so far , or else to take a further risk and to possibly succeed , he continued we are far more likely to take the latter risk seven members of the sheikh family of deir alzour , syria , traveled together from the cities of mersin and urfa in turkey they were from one of their city s most affluent and respected families before the civil war , and they brought along four friends from their hometown all 11 survived the mediterranean passage by boat from turkey , then the tear gas and clubs of the macedonian border police they rented hotel rooms in belgrade on the night of aug 23 , and their smuggler , known as abdel malek alafghani , arranged four taxis to go toward the hungarian border but the driver of one taxi inexplicably changed course and deposited yusuf elsheikh , 39 , with a teenage niece and nephew somewhere in the woods near the border the austrian police say smugglers often seek to divide migrant families with such tricks , to keep them tractable after a night in the forest , yusuf spent the last of his cash on a taxi back to belgrade his oldest brother , abdel salem , 55 , was carrying the rest of their money when the two brothers reached each other by telephone the next day , abdel reported that he was trapped somewhere in a hungarian forest the police had surrounded the migrants , he said , and the family was running out of food and water i told my brother , please come back you have to come back , ' because i had a bad feeling , yusuf recalled in an interview he and his teenage niece and nephew slept the night in a park in belgrade then , about 6 pm on aug 25 , abdel salem called to say that they could wait no longer the smuggler was bringing cars to take them to germany , he told yusuf mr afghani , the smuggler , called yusuf a short time later another taxi picked up him and the teenagers near a bridge across the danube and drove them toward the border , and this time mr afghani led them with a group of about 60 on a sevenhour walk through the night deep into hungary they slept the next day in a crowded safe house somewhere in hungary the next night , on aug 26 , mr afghani led yusuf and about 25 others bound for germany on a short walk to a road three of the migrants were younger than 5 , yusuf said , and mr afghani said he would return with cars but instead he pulled up with a truck he just came back and said , get in , ' yusuf recalled they would be packed standing together without room to sit for what was expected to be a ninehour drive , yusuf said he worried they would be unable to breathe we just wanted the journey to be over , and we kept asking , where is our family \? ' mr sheikh recalled in a recent interview , in vienna the smuggler told us , you are going to meet them in germany' yusuf got in and survived the austrian police found the truck abandoned the next morning and let out the passengers his brother abdel salem had made a similar choice with a different result abdel salem , his wife , a 23yearold son and a 16yearold daughter were among the 71 migrants found dead the same day in the meat truck
the last time a boat sailed into new york harbor bearing the marquis de lafayette , the arrival touched off a frenzy that would put beatlemania to shame the year was 1824 , and some 50 , 000 people roughly a third of new york s population lined the streets for a glimpse of lafayette , the french founding father , who was visiting the united states as part of a of the nation he had helped liberate nearly a halfcentury earlier he spent weeks barnstorming through the city , attending a ball for 6 , 000 at castle garden and even scooping up the 5yearold walt whitman for a kiss outside a brooklyn library , whitman later recollected on wednesday a replica of the , the threemasted , 32gun frigate that carried lafayette to america in 1780 with news of his king s military support for the americans , docked at the south street seaport more than two centuries later , the crowds were smaller but the scene was still clangorous after passing governors island , the hermione sent a round of cannon blasts echoing off the buildings of lower manhattan before gliding into port a band played down by the riverside as costumed crew members scrambled from the masts for another deafening and apparently unplanned salute call it the nautical equivalent of defying a smoking ban , or maybe a response to the motto on lafayette s coat of arms cur non , or why not \? the cannon fire , a spokesman for the ship said , was a spontaneous reaction from the crew , as it was the first time many of them had ever seen new york the hermione \( its french pronunciation is airmeeun \) built in rochefort , france , and hardly the worse for wear after a 31day atlantic crossing will be open for tours through friday , after which it will resume its 12stop itinerary north along the east coast if costumed reenactors and knottying demonstrations have replaced troops and live ammunition , it s still a ship with an urgent mission testifying to the importance of the somewhat frayed frenchamerican friendship through its most enduring human symbol there are two things the french and the americans agree on totally , bruno gravellier , the ship s superintendent , said before the boat s arrival in new york dday and lafayette for those in need of a brush up , the basics of lafayette s story are presented in a dockside exhibition , which also pays tribute to the charms of the poitoucharentes region of france , where the hermione built over two decades with more than 20 million in french government and private funds has been a tourist attraction a show at the , , on view through aug 16 , offers a more personal version , complete with objects from la grange , lafayette s estate , that had not previously left france , including the still brightred leather briefcase he carried to america and his souvenir locks of hair from george washington and thomas jefferson mariejoseph paul yves roch gilbert du motier de lafayette , a staggeringly wealthy provincial aristocrat who had married into one of france s grandest families , was 19 when he first landed in america , in 1777 , having sailed across the ocean on his own dime to support the revolution , in defiance of louis xvi he became a major general and something of an adopted son to washington after fighting at the battles of brandywine \( where he was wounded \) and rhode island , he returned to france , where he persuaded the king to lend troops to the american cause while passed over as commander in favor of rochambeau , lafayette was sent ahead on the hermione in may 1780 to personally inform washington that a halfdozen ships and some 5 , 000 french troops were on their way that support helped turn the tide of the revolution if america forgets its independence was due to french military assistance , that would be a sad thing , miles young , the new yorkbased worldwide chairman and chief executive of ogilvy mather and the president of the , said last week mr young , as it happens , was one the few britons given a prime seat when the replica made its initial landfall last month at yorktown , va , where lafayette helped washington s forces score their decisive victory in 1781 it was magnificent to see her coming up the york river , he said and there i was , lurking in the front row the hermione project , which began in 1993 , was the brainchild of erik orsenna , a french author , and benedict donnelly , a frenchman born to a parisian mother and an american officer who landed in normandy in 1944 the drawings for the original ship had been lost , so shipbuilders in rochefort , on the west coast of france , worked from those of a sister ship held in british admiralty archives the hull and masts were constructed from 2 , 000 french oaks each stitch in the 19 linen sails was sewn by a single sailmaker , and rigged by a team from sweden in all , the project involved about 400 , 000 wood and traditionally forged metal parts it s completely mad to build an 18thcentury frigate with this kind of almost religious authenticity , mr young said the ship , sailed by a mostly volunteer crew of 74 , does make some concessions to the 21st century , including a navigation system and historically incorrect bathrooms while the odor onboard in 1780 was foul , according to the dockside exhibition , the new hermione smells pleasantly of wood and the tar that coats the hemp ropes but the sailor s life is hard , even with modern conveniences crew members described exhilarating climbs up the mast on a rolling ship , along with bouts of seasickness , a few drenching storms and at least one minor mutiny we had to fight for the right to have nutella at 3 am , adam hodgesleclaire , 22 , of lincoln , mass , one of a handful of americans among the crew , said last month \( for the new york arrival , mr hodgesleclaire dressed in a french royal navy uniform , complete with a tasseled cap and a musket and bayonet \) people are very opinionated about food after a month at sea this being a french voyage , cuisine is not neglected a large barrel of hennessy cognac , one of two on board in tribute to those carried in 1780 , was unloaded at mount vernon in virginia , where it sold for about 150 , 000 at a charity auction \( the second will be sold in new york \) in philadelphia , there was a reenactment of the shipboard meal that the captain , louisren de latouche , shared with a delegation of the continental congress , featuring oysters , veal and cr me br l e at various stops there have been programs highlighting lafayette s personal commitment to liberty , which included a bond with james armistead , an enslaved africanamerican under his command who penetrated cornwallis s camp as a spy and took the surname lafayette after gaining freedom in 1787 all along the route , the ship has drawn people reporting that lafayette had given a bed to their masonic lodge , or danced with an ancestor he was so affable , so gregarious , said laura auricchio , the author of the recent biography who has given a number of talks along the route everybody who met him felt an immediate kinship he really belied the american impression of a french nobleman the hermione s launch from rochefort was attended by an array of dignitaries , including president fran ois hollande , who hailed the ship s historic journey of friendship but lafayette s legacy in his homeland is mixed during the french revolution , he supported a constitutional monarchy and opposed the jacobins , who attacked him as an enemy of the revolution one particularly scabrous satirical cartoon , showed him approaching marie antoinette , who was rumored \( apparently falsely \) to be his lover , while riding an ostrich shaped like a giant phallus lafayette escaped the guillotine that claimed a number of relatives , spending five years imprisoned in exile in austria and prussia he returned to france in 1800 , making a few forays back into politics but mostly holing up at la grange , where he died in 1834 , at age 76 while his death led to an outpouring of tributes in america \( including a threehour funeral oration by john quincy adams \) , the response in france was more muted a month after his death , an american visitor to paris noted that the name of lafayette is not heard a 1988 french encyclopedia quoted by ms auricchio notes that the man has drawn few eulogies none of this is likely to rain on the hermione s american parade , which will continue on the fourth of july , when the frigate leads a flotilla of private vessels from gravesend , brooklyn , past the and along the hudson river toward the intrepid before continuing to greenport on long island and points north on july 24 , the hermione will head back across the atlantic , ultimately returning to port in rochefort she will stay an ambassador , mr donnelly said she has to sail again and again especially to america
when the obama administration that it would let drill for off the alaskan coast this year if it met certain conditions , environmentalists were outraged not just by the administration s decision to allow drilling , but by its decision to give shell , in particular , the green light they said that the company s track record in the arctic should rule out another chance for it shell tried to drill in the arctic in 2012 , and the company s multibilliondollar drilling rig , the kulluk , the operator of a drill ship hired by shell to eight felony offenses and agreed to pay 122 million over shoddy recordkeeping that covered up hazardous conditions and juryrigged equipment that discharged polluted water shell has already proven itself not up to the challenge of development in the arctic ocean , said franz matzner , the director of the beyond oil initiative at the but it s not just shell the fact is , there s no safe way to pursue oil exploration in the frozen wastes of the arctic ocean he added , this is an inexplicable decision to do something that is dirty , dangerous and unnecessary shell , europe s leading oil company , has spent about 7 billion in the alaskan arctic over the last decade , and drilled two shallow wells during the 2012 attempt but the federal government did not allow the company to reach the deeper oilbearing formations because the containment dome designed to cap a runaway well in testing shell executives said they had shaken up their alaska team , putting in new management that would emphasize better management of contractors , readiness for any problems and contingency plans to care for any accidents the program has been fortified by new assets , an increased number of vessels , but most notably a new drilling rig , said curtis smith , a company spokesman , adding that shell had revamped its management of contractors it s our view we put together the most environmentally sensitive , technically sound arctic program ever assembled , he said , and if we did n't have confidence in it , we would n't execute it , even if we had all the permits at a news conference in houston last month , interior secretary sally jewell expressed confidence in the company s new plan , saying , there is no question shell learned expensive , painful lessons about contractors and safety she also said that shell had improved its containment plans in case of a spill such statements hardly satisfy environmentalists , however even some competing oil company executives openly wonder why shell is trying again it s too complicated , claudio descalzi , the chief executive of the italian oil company eni , said in a recent interview the company allowed its lease in alaska s chukchi sea to expire without drilling everything that is too complicated is too expensive and too risky and my job is to reduce risk , he said patrick pouyann , the chief executive of total , a french oil giant that produces in the russian arctic , also expressed doubts about drilling for oil in the alaskan arctic with prices virtually cut in half in recent months at 50 a barrel , it does not make any sense , he said in an interview these are highcost resources he added that a spill could be very detrimental for the reputation of a company after shell s problems , conocophillips and the norwegian oil giant statoil suspended their alaskan arctic drilling plans climate scientists have said for years that would open stretches of the arctic ocean to shipping and drilling and the alaskan arctic is one of the great untapped frontiers for in the united states , with the potential to produce up to a million barrels a day , or more than 10 percent of current domestic production , according to industry estimates but many experts warn that arctic ocean oil exploration involves high costs and enormous risks an arctic would have none of the conditions that helped mitigate effects of the 2010 deepwater horizon spill , including warm water , sunlight , relatively calm weather and ready access to cleanup and rescue equipment on the deepwater horizon explosion and spill warned in its comprehensive report against rushing into the offshore arctic while the sea depths and oil reservoir pressure are likely to present fewer challenges to extraction than conditions found in the deepwater wells of the gulf of mexico , the authors wrote , the fierce weather conditions and likely long life of any spilled oil along with the expected difficulty of mopping up spills and the effects on the environment all mean that getting oil out of the oceans off alaska requires the utmost care published in january in the journal nature suggested that , under the international voluntary target of keeping a global temperature rise to 36 degrees fahrenheit \( 2 degrees celsius \) to avert some of the worst outcomes of climate change , all arctic resources should be considered as unburnable christophe mcglade , a research associate at university college london and an author of the paper , said that the costs and risks of arctic reserves were too high , especially if climate regulations reduced the demand for fossil fuels in general oil and gas needs could then be met with more economical methods of recovery , including hydraulic fracturing james leaton , the research director at carbon tracker initiative , a think tank devoted to climate change business issues , questioned shell s determination to return to the arctic we struggle to see how shell could make a profit for shareholders at the lower oil prices we 're seeing today , he said they are like a dog with a bone , he added having spent billions , they 're unable to let go of it mr smith , the shell spokesman , said , we take a longterm view of price and energy supplies
baghdad an american soldier was killed in action in for the first time since the renewed military intervention here last year , during a kurdish and united states commando raid to free prisoners being held by islamic state militants on thursday , the pentagon said the raid , near the northern town of hawija , freed about 70 prisoners but not the group the soldiers had expected to find , american and iraqi officials said american officials said that five islamic state fighters had been detained and that important intelligence about the terrorist group had been recovered the raid was the first time american soldiers had been confirmed to be directly accompanying local forces in onto the battlefield against the islamic state since president obama sent troops back to the country last year until now , the american contingent , which numbers around 3 , 500 , had been limited to training and advising the iraqi and kurdish forces on military bases and training areas but senior american military officials have long signaled that they might ask the white house for permission to send small teams into the field with iraqi forces for some important operations , such as the battle for mosul the pentagon press secretary , peter cook , said the united states was trying to help a loyal ally the kurdish regional government and was also rushing to save lives this was a unique circumstance in which very close partners of the united states made a specific request for our assistance , he said so i would not suggest that this is something that s going to now happen on a regular basis it was not , mr cook insisted , a forerunner of a more aggressive posture in which american troops would regularly join the iraqis on combat operations the decision to use american helicopters to fly kurdish commandos to hawija , and to have american special operations forces join them in a supporting role , was taken by defense secretary ashton b carter the white house , mr cook said , was informed in advance providing new details about the operation , american officials said on thursday night that it had been mounted at the request of the kurdish officials who insisted they had solid intelligence that the islamic state was about to massacre prisoners , including a number of pesh merga fighters , as the kurdish forces are known they were going with or without us , said a senior defense department official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a classified operation we wanted to stand behind an important ally fears that the prisoners were in danger may have been reinforced by the militants' actions in recent days an iraqi in the hawija area , who asked not to be named because he feared retribution from the islamic state , said this week that the militants had recently executed 11 young men who were the sons or relatives of police officers or other iraqi forces he said their bodies had been displayed on a nearby bridge five american helicopters were involved in the raid , a mix of chinook and black hawk choppers the american forces included commandos from the delta force counterterrorism unit , officials said as the operation began , the united states conducted an airstrike to destroy a bridge near hawija and hamper the islamic state s ability to send reinforcements but the operation soon became an intense firefight kurdish forces were to take the lead in the operation while american soldiers , who were to play a supporting role , initially were near a wall that was some distance from the objective , officials said but the kurds were pinned down by fire from the militants so the americans began to maneuver to relieve the pressure on their kurdish allies and one of them was fatally wounded , said col steven h warren , a spokesman for the americanled coalition in iraq when the prisoners were freed , the kurds were surprised to see that no pesh merga fighters were among them it is not clear whether the initial intelligence was bad or the islamic state had moved the kurds somewhere else instead of the about 20 prisoners the commandos had anticipated , there were 69 , the kurds said they included more than 20 iraqi security forces , some local residents and apparently some militants whom the islamic state suspected as being traitors , according to american officials freed hostages have told iraqi and american officials in erbil , where they were taken , that they had been told they were to be executed at dawn on thursday after the morning prayer trench graves had already been dug as the american helicopters flew away , an american f15 jet bombed the house that the islamic state has used as its prison iraqis from the area said the building that the militants took over was owned by a local judge who had left the region they cut off roads and raided the place successfully , najmaldin karim , the governor of the surrounding kirkuk province , said in a telephone interview they were able to take people with them kurdish security officials said thursday night in a statement that more than 20 militants had been killed in the firefight and that six militants , not the five reported by the united states , had been captured the kurdish statement said that three kurdish commandos had been injured a news agency linked with the islamic state asserted that three militants who were defending the prison had been killed , and it said that islamic state fighters had killed some of their prisoners the operation comes as iraq and the americanled coalition have been trying to regain the initiative , stepping up the pressure against the militants in ramadi , baiji and other areas in iraq , as well as in syria hawija is under the control of the islamic state and has been an important flash point kurdish forces advanced toward the area in recent weeks and were said to have taken significant casualties , according to american officials the raid may intensify the public debate in the united states over the americans' military role in the region the obama administration has said that its goal is to degrade and ultimately defeat the islamic state , but the campaign against the militants has progressed slowly some experts say there is no such thing as a riskfree conflict and that american teams will need to venture outside their bases to advise iraqi forces if they are to evict the islamic state from iraq critics , however , are likely to portray the raid as a case of mission creep the pentagon has not yet named the soldier who was killed , a standard procedure until relatives are notified military personnel from other coalition nations have also been killed in the campaign against the islamic state since its advance through iraq last year a canadian soldier was killed in northern iraq in march in a socalled friendlyfire incident involving kurdish troops and a jordanian pilot was by the islamic state after his plane crashed in syria in december while american commando operations have taken place in syria , none had previously been confirmed to have happened n iraq
kingston , jamaica sound rises like a cliff wall drums , trombones , trumpets , the ubiquitous vuvuzela , the odd french horn and 10 , 000 fans screaming on the blue track below , 15yearold boys have shot out of the blocks for the 400 meters , postures erect , arms slicing through the tropical air like knives faster , faster , they curl around the track as if astride that wave of sound this is the high school competition known as champs , in which longlimbed schoolchildren from valleys and fishing villages and industrial cities descend on this capital city for five days , they lay down astonishing times , often only a few ticks off world records for this trackobsessed island nation its sprinters won four events at the london olympics in 2012 even a 400meter preliminary counts as a moment to immediately find a television set three days later , for the finale , the cement bowl of a stadium will be packed with 33 , 000 fans , all but levitating i came here to interview the mellifluously named usain bolt , certifiably the fastest man in the world he is preparing for another olympic push , his last there are serious questions to ask about his plans and his future to understand how jamaica came to dominate sprinting like the swiss dominate the clock business and therefore to make sense of bolt , who came flying out of the country village sherwood content it helps to take the measure of the national mania that is champs , in which bolt ran as a schoolboy late one evening , after watching a day of races , i hopped in a taxi , a rattling contraption piloted by sam carty , a reggae musician with grayflecked dreadlocks he had the champs races on the radio did you run as a schoolboy \? he nodded and said , of course i ran the 100 meters in 106 , he said of a time when the world record was 99 seconds i still run to satisfy myself he steered his taxi onto a dirt patch the last sprint of the night at champs was about to commence , and he needed to concentrate  i walked into champs for the first time on a recent wednesday , the second day of the competition purple thunderheads piled high above the ridges of the blue mountains the crowd clapped rhythmically as a teenage girl , tamara moncrieff , hurtled down the track toward the longjump pit moncrieff went on to win a championship two days later i cleared my mind , i hopped , i stopped , and i jumped , this shy young woman explained then and i got the record i sidled over to orville austin , a 54yearold hospital technician who sits high in the grandstand he attends every year who do you root for \? kingston college ! he said , showing me his purple tie hundreds of middleaged adults were dressed in the colors of their alma maters to read off the school names calabar , kingston college , wolmer s , glenmuir , camperdown , oberlin , happy grove is to summon a surge of memories each school has colors , chants and highpitched cries \( the wolmer s cry calls to mind a seal bark \) do you live around here \? canarsie , austin replied that is in brooklyn a bag at his feet was filled with school ties , which he was going to distribute to friends upon his return members of the jamaica diaspora , whose numbers are vast and often accomplished , are known to wear such ties to cocktail parties several friends attended kingston college s archrival , calabar high school , a perennial athletic power \( the track announcer pronounced this caaalabahrrr , with a scottish roll of the r \) mine is a very deep hatred for calabar , austin said he texted a calabar friend with a photo of himself look what i'm wearing a tshirt ! it s 84 degrees , and kingston is beating calabar he chortled i walked into a thicket of teenage boys from st catherine s who had completed their races dressed in sky blue slacks and matching backpacks , they lingered in the grandstand to cheer for the st catherine s girls , who ran in the early evening they joked and laughed , moving effortlessly between rapidfire patois and crisp , britishinflected english how 'd it go today , i asked 15yearold thor samuels he beamed i love running , he said i feel like i'm riding the wind there is much joy to be heard and seen , although races are no teenage lark the corporate sponsors , as well as college and pro scouts , line up six deep the teenagers acknowledge great pressure to set record times and perhaps obtain scholarships in the united states or , better , a pro contract top high schools compete ferociously , sometimes offering refrigerators to poor families if their children will transfer girls and boys can run three races each day some collapse , grabbing at cramped muscles it s too big , if you ask me , kingston college coach neil harrison said every year it gets more intense harrison is one of jamaica s most successful track coaches he has a restless eye for talent several years back , he was in the turks and caicos islands and noticed the center fielder in a baseball game sprinting after a double into the gap by autumn , harrison had that boy at jamaica college , running under his tutelage now the runner sprints for the british national team harrison shrugged we jamaicans know running straight through , he said  to better understand that heritage , i hailed a taxi the next morning and set off up the hills to manor park , where the breezes are persimmonscented and there are sweeping vistas of the glittering caribbean sea dennis johnson was waiting on his veranda a handsome man of 75 with snowwhite hair and sideburns , he is a godfather of jamaican track once upon a time , he was recruited to race at san jose state in 1961 , he three times equaled the world record in the 100 yards , at 93 seconds \( another jamaican , herb mckenley , won three silver medals and a gold in the 1948 and 1952 olympics combined norman manley , one of the island s most revered statesmen , ran the 100 yards in 10 seconds flat at the 1911 champs , a record that stood for 41 years \) johnson studied under the esteemed san jose state coach bud winter and returned to jamaica as an apostle of the scientific method of running he helped found a college to train coaches to reach more remote outposts on this poor and mountainous island , johnson loaded up his van we spread the gospel of sprinting , he said many struggle to explain the success of jamaican sprinters some jamaicans argue for genetics while a local professor champions the extraordinary dietary effects of green bananas and yams johnson rolled his eyes it s not magical yams , he said it s a poor island , and if you have a pair of cleats , you can compete we brought in the best coaches and the best training the results are on display at the national stadium the champs athletes run erect , arms thrusting forward , not side to side their cores are powerful their strides carry no hint of wobble johnson walked me to the door every little kid running in kindergarten believes they could be usain bolt , he said we 're going to dominate sprint for the next 50 years great expectation comes married to worry , so i had a last stop before talking to bolt in 2013 , renee shirley , a former executive director of the jamaica antidoping commission , that the group had failed to conduct outofcompetition blood tests on athletes in the months leading to the olympics she and another prominent former official of the commission , dr paul wright , have characterized jamaica as halfhearted in confronting the menace of doping for her candor , shirley was consigned to a purgatory this is sad twice over she adores her island s track and field accomplishments and recent test results underline the wisdom of waving a yellow flag of caution several of jamaica s most illustrious runners , including the olympic gold medalists asafa powell and sherone simpson , have tested positive for stimulants \( it s worth noting that justin gatlin , the leading sprinter in the united states and perhaps the leading challenger to bolt in the 2016 summer games , is coming off a fouryear suspension for the use of more serious banned drugs at age 33 , when most sprinters are retired , gatlin is again laying down top times \) shirley wants to see a testing regimen applied to champs a teenager runs the 400meter race and shows up three hours later for a 200meter race \? she said who is to say someone is not handing them an energy drink that might have unlabeled prohibited substances \? the high school principals spoke of testing this year , only to back off you need a sense of urgency , shirley said this is a beautiful sport time to search for bolt  i sat in the softshadowed lobby of the spanish court hotel bolt was late , and his coach did not answer texts i looked up from my phone , and there he stood , a muscled sweep of a man in a pastel yellow running shirt , blue striped shorts and pumas we walked upstairs usain ! a young chambermaid ran into the hall can i hug you \? bolt opened his arms , and she embraced him i asked if this happened often he nodded it s a perk he acknowledged that he needed to stay away from prolonged hugs i am dating fully now i think i'm almost there official with a girl , he said he took a seat on the veranda as a child in trelawny parish , he played soccer and cricket running was easy , like breathing , and not to be taken seriously then he traveled down country and laid down astonishing times his champs record in the 200 meters still stands it was just fun , he said i never thought i could make a career of it a coach persuaded him otherwise bolt s workouts are rigorous and extend 11 months a year \( he takes a month off after the end of the season now my coach wants me to do active rest , with more running , he said with a roll of his eyes \) he benchpresses 200 pounds and saves his running for the cool of evening , two and a half to three hours each day i do abs and core work every day , he said i started to ask about performanceenhancing drugs he smiled and interrupted drugging \? he said i have been asked that so many times it s just one of those things other athletes have tainted the sport it takes a while to get back to the point where people say , ok , i believe in this person' his running is magnificent he accelerates , and the world s best sprinters fall away like so much shucked corn his times are revolutionary his joy is infectious he has taken drug tests , and antidoping officials have never publicly charged him as to belief who would not hope \? bolt , 28 , can see the shadow of athletic old age in track and field , i'm middle age , he said you do n't want to be one of the athletes who stick around for too long he plans to compete in june on randalls island in new york the site of his first worldrecord time , in 2008 and then at the world championships in beijing in august he had expected that the 2016 olympics in brazil would be his last call puma , his sponsor , persuaded him to take a oneyear victory lap he will try to make it memorable i will work hard to put more strain on my records , he said then that will be that you do n't want the young guys to start beating you , he said , smiling faintly it takes away your glory he shook hands and slipped down a staircase to a waiting car , which was to carry him to his afternoon workout  on saturday , the ticket line formed hours before the gate opened for the champs finale horses carrying officers trotted about i stopped by fatty s food court to pick up jerk chicken and coconut bread wrapped in tin foil i squeezed into a bleacher seat the grandstand was a sedate neighborhood , everyone pressed in tight there was none of that recorded make some noise ! baloney as at madison square garden the sound was organic and rolled like the ocean lines of wolmer s girls came dressed in matronly aquamarine school uniforms the calabar boys were snappy in their green and black children blew on vuvuzelas mothers readied thunderstix fans unfurled vast school banners , which stretched across 30 rows of seats music played drums thumped discus throwers took balletic spins high jumpers prepared to leap and the fans bounced and screamed as sprinters went into their raceready prayer stances a flight to new york forced me to leave at dusk already fans were trying to scale the walls and climb the light towers i ran into orville jackson , the hurdles coach for calabar , by way of laurel , md , where he drives a tractortrailer this is amazing , i told him he grinned it s like religion , man the hills turned deep blue at night s touch at the airport , expats packed the lounge they craned their necks , looking at the television sets this would be the last chance before we boarded to watch those highstepping kids sprint under that soaring jamaican sky
kim gordon s antiseptic show looks as if it were formulated by a computer bot that mixes and matches postmodernist art clich s ms gordon , better known as the charismatic frontwoman of the band sonic youth , intends a critique of highend real estate development in new york city , but what she has wrought is unimaginative , conceptually facile and oddly impersonal at the start is a panel with the sardonic words the city is a garden written on it in brushy , drippy black paint it suggests a trendy designer s appropriation of expressionist graffiti on the gallery floor are large sheets of paper draped over invisible armatures scrawled on them in black paint are partly visible words , which are , according to the gallery checklist , the names of new condo buildings in manhattan , like the and along with those paper works are fake green hedges trimmed to resemble boxy minimalist sculptures they skeptically allude to cosmetic municipal improvements like the high line in chelsea on the gallery walls hang abstractions in the form of crumpled pieces of paper adorned with spray paint and glitter from the series ladies of the paradise in this context , they suggest the entertainment industry s dazzling distractions from real social problems none of these things offer any provocative insight about the material or spiritual conditions of modern life ms gordon , 62 , is n't new to art she graduated from the otis college of art and design in los angeles and has exhibited extensively and internationally over the past dozen years nevertheless , as a visual artist , it appears she has yet to find her true calling
it s looking pretty grim for the exportimport bank of the united states over the last few months , the bank , which extends loans and government guarantees to help american companies export their goods and thus create jobs , has been under intense assault from conservative republicans opposed to its very existence almost every day i get at least one email blast from a conservative think tank denouncing the bank for its crony capitalism and corporate welfare conservative economists keep pounding away at their belief that , in macroeconomic terms , the exim bank s job creation is illusory whatever jobs might be gained when one company starts exporting are lost at another company , they say most of the republican presidential candidates are falling all over themselves to declare their opposition to the agency , which is set to die unless congress reauthorizes it by june 30 in the house of representatives , jeb hensarling , the texas republican who is chairman of the house financial services committee and is an implacable foe of the bank has made it plain that he is eager to see the bank die , casting the issue as one of free markets versus business interests he has made no moves to introduce a reauthorization bill in the senate , mitch mcconnell , the majority leader , who is also against the bank , has grudgingly agreed to allow a vote on a reauthorization amendment , which supporters hope to attach to a future mustpass bill that would then go to the house but do n't get your hopes up just because the senate votes on a piece of crap does n't mean we have to vote for it , retorted representative mick mulvaney , a house republican from south carolina , , a newspaper on capitol hill in a news conference this week , hensarling said that the momentum is in our favor he s right there are dozens of countries that have socalled export credit agencies like the exim bank they all do the same thing they help finance some of their country s exports some countries , like china , use a variety of other techniques to push their exports guess how many of those countries are following america s lead in trying to wind down that assistance \? on the contrary , they 're rather enjoying watching the us cut off its nose to spite its face the conservative opposition is rooted in ideology , of course conservatives argue , for instance , that the government has no business guaranteeing loans if the private sector is n't willing to make them but this defies reality in the real world , there are plenty of perfectly good loans that the private sector wo n't make small companies that want to expand abroad have a terrible time getting loans big companies often need a government guarantee just to compete for a major contract after the financial crisis , the exim bank increased its financings precisely because the banks were gunshy now that the private sector is making more loans , the agency has backed off another conservative argument i 've heard recently is that the big companies that use guarantees from the exim bank , such as boeing , general electric and caterpillar , have years of back orders , so they can afford to lose a little business if the agency dies boeing has a backlog of 441 billion in back orders , said diane katz of the heritage foundation \( it s now up to 495 billion , according to boeing \) they ca n't keep up with all the work she ca n't really mean to say that it s ok if boeing , america s largest manufacturing exporter , loses business , can she \? a third argument is the macroeconomic one that ultimately the exim bank does not create net new jobs whenever you subsidize a us company , you are ignoring the fact that other us companies could have made that same sale without the subsidy , said daniel ikenson , the director of trade policy studies at the cato institute and a leading proponent of this theory but i wonder that general electric will lose a 350 million deal to build locomotives for angola without the exim bank s assistance the winner wo n't be another american company , though it will be a chinese company , which will have export credit financing , this one a 668 million public water project , done in partnership with a second company , that relied on exim loan guarantees without the bank , the second phase of the project will again be lost to a chinese rival the story of air tractor , a maker of cropdusting and firefighting aircraft in the rural west texas town of olney that will lose a quarter of its business without the exim bank how is that a good thing \? over the last halfdozen years , republicans have done many things that have hurt the american economy and the american worker , of a few years ago if they succeed in eliminating the exim bank , you 'll be able to add that to the list
the mythology of a boxed set is often one of completion it provides framework and boundaries to an artist , or a scene , or a sound and these days compilations of this sort tend toward two directions omnibus releases of an artist s full catalog or evermoreobscure digs into regional subcultures and other shortlived styles lost to time in both cases , what seems like a full picture is often just a steppingstone to broader inquiry a great boxed set does n't end conversations it begins them here , the pop and jazz critics of the new york times spotlight the most provocative and curiosityinducing collections from this year more detailed information is at jon caramanica the first in a series of comprehensive bowie boxes , this set skips his early missteps and instead dives in where the bowie mythos begins space oddity , which showed his comfort with baroque \( and also oddball \) character and narrative featured here are the six studio albums from this period , spanning the first flickers of glam rock on the man who sold the world to the spectacle in full flower on the rise and fall of ziggy stardust and the spiders from mars \( the inessential covers album pin ups is here as well \) rounding it all out are two live albums , a stereo version of ziggy stardust and re call 1 , which includes odds and ends mono editions , single edits and ragazzo solo , ragazza sola , a version of space oddity with new lyrics in italian jon caramanica joe castro was a good jazz pianist in the mid1950s concise , cool , swinging he was also dating the tobacco heiress doris duke , among the richest women in the world one of the ways that his romantic life changed his jazz life was that he could invite his friends over to play in a nice studio over the garage the tapes from those sessions are released here for the first time mostly they come from the house in beverly hills , once owned by rudolph valentino , where castro lived with duke or from the duke family s new jersey estate they involve some of the great and inveterate jammers of the day on the west coast buddy collette , chico hamilton , teddy edwards , billy higgins and leroy vinnegar on the east coast zoot sims and oscar pettiford and lucky thompson you should be excited reading the name lucky thompson in 1956 he was stealthy and brilliant , even in casual circumstances like these but in general this is a set of solid

curtis fuller s fire and filigree and hartman s once in every life ben ratliff miles davis effectively began his majorlabel career at the newport jazz festival it was his graceful turn at the 1955 festival that led to his being signed by columbia that performance appears here alongside recordings from subsequent newport sets , spanning 20 years the material , almost four hours of which was never previously released , moves through davis s storied evolution like a series of progress reports both of his celebrated quintets make strong showings , as do several exploratory fusion bands the

transforming himself from folkie to rocker and showing a generation how much more ambition a song could hold he was reinventing the sound and meaning of rock , and doing it impulse by impulse the process is revealed on the cutting edge , collections of studio outtakes from those albums two nicely culled discs , the best of the cutting edge , for the curious six discs , the deluxe edition , for

a band or left alone he tries mr tambourine man with a drummer , then decides against it six months later , for highway 61 revisited , he s thinking like a bandleader , testing out tempos , keys and approaches like a rolling stone as a waltz \? it takes a lot to laugh , it takes a train to cry hurtling down the track like subterranean homesick blues \? and by the time he records songs for blonde

rolling stone shows the musicians hitting the pinnacle early take 4 and then fruitlessly trying to better it none of the outtakes outshine the album versions , but they reveal how much mr dylan was following brilliant instinct , not a master plan jon pareles most celebrated field recordings of american folk music are documents of the rural south , but this absorbing collection makes the case for a different milieu entirely a territory of deep woods , inland seas , mines , mills , and hardscrabble farms , as its producer , james p leary , observes in the accompanying 456page book a mindboggling swath of material , variously recorded in the upper midwest by alan lomax , sidney robertson and helene stratmanthomas , it encompasses jigs and chanteys , lumberyard chants and lullabies , twosteps and drinking songs there s a finnish chant said to cure hiccups there are serbian folk tunes , swedish yodels and a ritual song by the ojibwe fiddler joe cloud a supplemental dvd contains

singing in bars but as a radio announcer out west , switching between sober news reports and a hillbilly show called bar nothin' ranch time crossing over became his normal mode once discovered , he became a national bard with a killer bassbaritone voice refined , stentorian , corny around the edges \( it could be all that in one song , as in the sublime chicken road \) early on he sang crisp and teasing hillbilly boogie , but eventually grew elsewhere into folk , gospel , heavydrapery pop , and semioperatic songs about donkeys , cute dogs and santa claus when country singers were suiting up in pastel colors and rhinestones , ford took on the appearance of statesman , professor or gentleman farmer , presenting americana cabaret with homestead values he was a television presence , as host of the kollege of musical knowledge , and eventually of his own popular halfhour variety program , the ford show \( that renown gave him an instant audience for sixteen tons , in 1955 , his biggest hit \) bear family s lavish and informed box set full of rare photos and historical essays stops in 1960 , just before ford lost his modicum of hipness and plunged into alcoholism and bohemian grove

his kindly tenor voice accompanied by just an acoustic guitar or two frank s life before and after 1965 was difficult he was badly scarred during a fire at his elementary school , and in later years he was in and out of mental hospitals and sometimes homeless he wrote and recorded songs when he could , and they were just as folky and approachable as his earlier ones , yet newly cryptic and even more haunted , particularly the halfdozen songs from the early 1970s that this collection has unearthed his last recordings , solo in a kitchen in 1997 , show a far more weathered singer , but not a bitter one jon pareles less a work of scholarship than the product of hobbyist enthusiasm , this collection revels in retro grassskirt exoticism , celebrating not only the likes of the steel guitarist sol ho opi i but also betty boop and the hawaii fiveo theme produced in consultation with the cartoonist robert armstrong , the set features his colorful illustrations reproductions of vintage sheet music and memorabilia from his collection and a handful of tracks he has recorded with ken emerson , as the slackkey guitar duo ken and bob nate chinen early in their career , the isley brothers bounced from label to label , but only truly hit their stride with the founding of their own , tneck this heavy box is an almost complete set of the group s output right up until the time hiphop became central to black pop \( and which they would be a part of , through samples \) the music is familiar and frisky lustrous soul that omnivorously takes in gospel , rock and especially funk most notable here is the inclusion of wild at woodstock , a silky live studio recording that has never before been released in full jon caramanica when reggae went fully electric in the mid1980s , king jammy was the plug , a producer of smooth reggae who instantly understood what he had on his hands with wayne smith s under me sleng teng , the song that set the table for the genre s digital dash roots , reality sleng teng shows his work before and after that moment , though its notquitesecret secret is that , even as the genre was morphing , he remained partial to smooth singers like frankie paul \( i know the score \) and john holt \( if i were a carpenter \) the producer gussie clarke also survived reggae s great shift , but his transition , as captured on from the foundation , was perhaps even more striking , moving from roots records with big youth to slick crossover with shabba ranks jon caramanica twenty or 30 years ago box sets were often conceptual and , historically speaking , horizontal they proposed a broad idea about a scene or a sound or an aesthetic these days they tend to be more proprietary and vertical the complete works of a single label or a single band the results are thoughtless , if it s a wellknown band , or completely to the point , if it s one that few people ever knew which is where laddio bolocko and craw come in laddio bolocko played dirty , aggressive , improvised , exacting and oblique instrumental music with guitars , drums and the saxophonist marcus degrazia in brooklyn during the midtolate90s , when the rock scene there was unimpressive at best \( i never saw them i only knew what became of them two members , drew st ivany and ben armstrong , went on to found the excellent band the psychic paramount the indefatigable drummer blake fleming helped start the mars volta \) during the band s life it rehearsed where it lived , jamming for hours , collapsing the space between free jazz and progrock , and put out records in small pressings laddio bolocko broke up in 2001 , and two years later the label no quarter released the band s studio recordings posthumously but now we get the tapes from its rehearsals and live sets , and perhaps that s even better this was almost a private band , and the box set provokes a kind of doubletake did this even really happen \? before laddio bolocko , mr degrazia had been a member of craw , a cleveland band also doing something dirty and aggressive , but with more structure and less jamming , growing out of american postpunk sources like the jesus lizard craw s first three albums , reissued in this box set , were organized explosions , increasingly complex and forecasting a strain of meticulous but heavy music that s still developing around the world they were recorded by steve albini , who likes dry vocals and powerful drums both sets are missing links from a strange dead zone in american underground rock the six or seven years , let s say , after nirvana and before the reinvention of brooklyn ben ratliff somehow there had never been a comprehensive survey of recordings by lead belly aka huddie william ledbetter , the louisiana folk hero and bluesman , and a figure of great lasting influence before this lavishly produced set the music , including a rare radio broadcast from 1941 , conveys deep , unshakable selfpossession , no less in lead belly s quavering holler than in his 12string acoustic guitar playing an accompanying coffeetable book is chockfull of striking photographs , reproduced handbills and letters , and insights nate chinen mid1960s los angeles psychedelia reached one of its peaks with arthur lee s band , love his songs swiveled amid folk rock , blues rock , jazz , baroque pop and , now and then , flamenco his voice and lyrics could be wildeyed , enigmatic or disarmingly unguarded but lee , who died in 2006 , toured sporadically , and the record company that released love s best album , forever changes , in 1967 , did n't leave behind highquality live recordings this anthology of love in concert starts in 1970 , with love s sinewy but less adventurous second lineup , still honoring the songs' odd shapes two guitar acoustic shows from 1992 bare the vulnerability and waywardness in lee s songs , and triumphal early 2000s performances of forever changes , backed by strings and horns , prove how durable those psychedelic artifacts remain jon pareles you know the little richard story for about a year and a half in the mid1950s he was on an unmatchable tear , one that changed pop music history tuttifrutti , long tall sally , lucille , keep a knockin' , jenny , jenny they all flooded out in that stretch , before little richard announced that he was leaving pop for a life in the ministry this set collects everything from that era , and adds some of the material he recorded in the 1960s after he returned to secular music though its attempts to remain current with rb s changes only underscore how charmed his initial run was jon caramanica this aquatically soothing set collects everything mr mathis released first as a single , which is to say his most craven and marketgeared material , though to be fair , for a stretch from the mid1950s to the mid1960s , mr mathis and the market were practically one and the same a judicious singer who expressed excitement or passion with quick jumps in octaves or syrupy notes held for seconds , mr mathis specialized in the gentle vocal gesture when this set arrives at the late 1960s , he sounds out of sorts in his attempts at folk that detour aside , early songs like let s love and call me are whispered arguments for the beauty and resilience of restraint jon caramanica if there s been a crisp , fractured , breakneck form of electronic music in the last two decades , mike paradinas has made it himself or released it his label , planet mu , has been a consistent inspiration at the more frantic edges of electronic music , and also a hub of reinvention , moving from the idm of the late 1990s through the less muscled stripes of dubstep into a flirtation with grime and , most recently , becoming the biggest international advocate for footwork , the frenetic chicago dancefloor style this sweatinducing box is comprised almost wholly of unreleased material from the label s long run twisted , nervy experimentation by hrvatski rapidfire videogame assaults by datach'i gutpunch chaos by venetian snares rb sped up and chopped into pieces by dj nate in tempo and energy , these songs are car chases , but they 're unmistakably elegant jon caramanica there s only one song on this sleek , expensive objet d'art by the national that s a selling point , in case you were wondering a lot of sorrow is the byproduct of a durational performance , conceived with the icelandic artist ragnar kjartansson , in the vw dome at moma ps1 in 2013 that piece featured the band playing its mopey anthem sorrow for six hours straight an experience you are now free to replicate with these nine lps , made of translucent vinyl and stored in a screenprinted box \( yes , it s a lot , but do n't say they did n't warn you \) nate chinen twenty years ago , the english label soul jazz released a valuable doubledisc anthology of new york s latin music from the prime salsa era , nu yorica ! , compiled by stuart baker , the label s founder it went beyond the popular records of the day for radio and dancers , looking instead toward longer jams with stronger cuban and puerto rican roots or toward dense funk and electric jazz every track here is deep , rigorous and searching , taken from albums including those by charlie palmieri , joe bataan , stone alliance and others it s not a story of surefire hits , but a story of collective trances and intuitive musical expansion the set s been out of print for years pick one up before it disappears again ben ratliff this box celebrating the life and influence of the mountainmusic veteran ola belle reed , who died in 2002 , is really a tale of the passions of two folklorists in the 1960s , henry glassie traveled to rural pennsylvania and recorded ms reed extensively she has a commanding , slippery voice , conveying sadness and fortitude with equal intensity by the time mr glassie discovered her , she was practiced and formidable these crisp recordings are practically acts of reverence the reed songs comprise the first disc here , and her shadow hovers over the second clifford murphy returned to the region around four decades later to document the ways her influence persisted a noble , worthy quest , but one that only reinforces just how vital ms reed sounds , even with a halfcentury s distance jon caramanica remember that irresistible 1960s dance craze called the sock , in which the feelin' is a groove makes you wiggle when you move \? few others do , either it was a barely noticed 1966 song with a big backbeat and a yakety saxophone by the sharpees , led by benny sharp from mississippi on guitar it s one of the soul gems recorded by onederful ! , a chicago label that often looked toward the southern soul of stax records rather than the suaver , jazzier style usually associated with chicago soul this opening volume of a sixpart series includes the label s most famous names otis clay , betty everett , the five dutones \( with their renowned precursor to twerking , shake a tail feather \) others , like liz lands and mckinley mitchell , have voices that still leap out and tear things up jon pareles in 1965 , mgm records signed roy orbison to a 1 million contract with grueling details 25 , 000 a year for 20 years , three albums a year orbison was hugely productive he wrote concise , unconventionally structured songs suffused with desperate yearning , and sang them in his longbreathed tenor , which rarely left melancholy behind , even in his soaring crescendos but his career faltered partly from recordcompany misfires , partly because the psychedelic era did n't welcome an orchestraloving rockabillyera holdout in horn rims , no matter how startling his songs were below the surface that makes the mgm years , particularly the 1960s albums and singles , a trove of underappreciated material , especially suited to tearful moments mr orbison s family also discovered , for separate release , an entire 1969 album that mgm had inexplicably rejected one of the lonely ones , with orbison in elegantly downhearted form jon pareles in the mid1970s , manufacturing in the midwest was collapsing , and punk was manifesting amid its ashes these two compilations , part of a continuing series , are efficient digests of how the midwest was molting in real time cleveland and akron , while only about 40 miles apart , had decidedly different inspirations and paths of evolution cleveland had the slick pagans , the exorbitantly strange electric eels and the foundational artpunks pere ubu akron , more directly affected by the 1970 shootings at kent state , and also the vibrant assortment of artists , musicians and writers who taught there , spawned the pungent rubber city rebels and the highly evolved conceptual punks in devo jon caramanica remtv spans 25 years of performing live , 19832008 on small stages and huge ones , calmly acoustic or loud and distorted , wearing tshirts or suit and tie the band was gawky at first , but michael stipe s command as a frontman grew with rem s audience and from the beginning , rem was rightly confident that its musical boundaries a mid1960s spectrum of folk rock , garage rock and psychedelic pop , charged with a hint of punk recklessness and delineated by peter buck s guitar picking were capacious enough for decades of ideas the set does n't include rem s music videos only its live shows , which often repeat obligatory hits like losing my religion the sixth disc is a documentary built from mtv interviews through the years , showing a band determined to follow its own impulses jon pareles bobby rush made his first singles in the late 1960s as a soul shouter the funky chicken heads , in 1971 , was the song that got him noticed but he had been playing guitar and harmonica on the blues and rb chitlin' circuit for years before that , and he has spent most of his career where the chitlin' circuit survives in the deep south , where blues , soul and funk are all part of the mix this collection demonstrates his tenacity , his adaptability from blues moans to nasal funk yowls to suave soul , and his stockpile of downhome , storytelling songs full of everyday situations and wry raunchiness , delivered with plenty of humor amid the grit in i got 3 problems , he itemizes i got a problem with my woman , with my girlfriend and my wife jon pareles he may have popularized the concept album , headlined television specials and enjoyed success on the silver screen , but frank sinatra had an especially charmed relationship with the medium of radio this collection gathers broadcasts from the first 20 years of his career , opening with the hoboken four on major bowes amateur hour the rest of the trove , culled from multiple archives , comes with the trappings of the given format cigarette endorsements , cornball banter , callouts to the troops in his pitches and preambles , sinatra often sounds like the skinny kid that he was at the time but as soon as his voice meets a melody , cushioned by axel stordahl s gilded arrangements , a deep composure descends , pointing the way forward nate chinen the ecstatic , kaleidoscopic glory of a concert by sly and the family stone was no secret by the time the band appeared at bill graham s fillmore east in the fall of 1968 this previously unreleased material four full sets , from a twonight stand captures that funky transcendence in rich detail along with sly stone s explosive magnetism , it s a showcase for an unbeatable band dynamic , at once supertight and blazingly unhinged nate chinen bruce springsteen s 1980 album , the river , was expansive two lps interlaced with themes of fleeting time and tenuous human connections even as it forged his newly succinct songwriting approach of character studies told as laconically as possible getting to that balance was torturous dozens of songs were recorded and set aside a 10song album was prepared for release , then withdrawn and reworked for a year this boxed set expands the original album with the onelp version and 22 finished but unused songs half of them previously unreleased , including worthy ones like chain lightning , stray bullet and little white lies the dvds hold an hourlong documentary of mr springsteen s reminiscences about making the river and more than two hours of a 1980 concert in arizona with mr springsteen and the e street band in their wildeyed , crazylegged prime jon pareles the staple singers celebrated the promise of heaven and called for better times on earth roebuck \( pops \) staples and his harmonizing children mavis , cleotha and either pervis or yvonne had a gloriously closeknit sound pops , born in mississippi , defined the songs with his bluesy , twangy electric guitar and sang some gently devout lead vocals mavis stepped forward for the rest , with a deep voice that became even gutsier and sultrier as she grew up in the 1960s the staples joined the civil rights movement , singing alongside the rev dr martin luther king jr and infusing bob dylan songs with gospel in the 1970s , they brought redemptive sentiments to the top 10 with i 'll take you there

offbrand tv channels that were home to all sorts of oddball programming , too much of it lost to time fortunately , the chicago party remains a show designed to promote a nightclub , copherbox ii , it ran for 23 saturdays in 1982 there was music , sure many almostwere chicago acts of the day are assembled on this collection of spirited and sassy funksoul and jumpy disco , including strong tracks from jesus wayne and ken allison but the dvd here is where the real action takes place live performances , grown folks dancing , onthefly fashion shows , varietyshow humor , and the sort of arbitrary weirdness that happens when cameras are running and no one is watching jon caramanica unwound , a very postpunk band from olympia , wash , lasted just over a decade \( 19912002 \) it stayed rigorously alternative as in writing unpop songs and touring only allages venues while the world discovered grunge unwound s songs were serious , dissonant and made for both visceral power and conceptual rigor , riffing hard and asymmetrically behind contentious , sardonic lyrics numero group has been gradually reissuing unwound s albums , and empire completes the job with the band s last two albums , challenge for a civilized society \( 1998 \) and the double album leaves turn inside you \( 2001 \) , along with demos the songs churn and squall , make mathrock patterns and plow through them , drone and seethe , glower and persevere even when the music turns low and slow , there s a coiled tension jon pareles these cds consist of 42 tracks of live recordings made by the velvet underground in a small san francisco club called the matrix on nov 26 and 27 , 1969 fifteen ended up on 1969 velvet underground live , which came out on lp in the mid70s , after the group had ended to some ears it s the best thing the band ever did , even with its slightly amateurish fourtrack audio what you have here is mostly not the obdurate noise and drones of their early work \( though there is a little of that \) , but something different , joyful and delicate and intimate here was where the group did it all best , folding together memphis rb , tin pan alley , bob dylan , bo diddley and the sensual aggression of the early new york minimalists lou reed sounds as engaged as he could be , singing alternate verses to his storysongs , playing rhythm guitar with obsessive focus maureen tucker s drum beats were precise and calibrated , not just simple this is n't an art project it s a working band even better , the whole thing has been given a new mix , such that you can hear the music in all its

winnipeg , manitoba for a woman who has not played a competitive soccer game in about two months , alex morgan has managed to remain a brilliant ray of sunshine on the eve of the women s world cup so what if a bone bruise in her left knee has sidelined her since early april , leaving the united states women s team without its best goal scorer ahead of a tournament it is desperate to win once june 8 comes , there is no question in my mind that my knee will not be bothering me , morgan said last month i 'll be 100 percent confidence is one thing and reality is another even for morgan , the charismatic no 13 who is beloved by marketers and also , in growing numbers , the public she may be the face of united states women s soccer , but that does n't mean she is superhuman and june 8 is now here while morgan has been working on her strength and fitness , there is nothing that can replicate the pace and intensity of a world cup game not a pretournament exhibition match or even the most difficult practice morgan has had none of the former , and only a precious few of the latter entering the americans' opening game of the world cup on monday against australia her poor knee has no idea what it s about to go through and on artificial turf , no less i do n't expect alex to be 90minutes fit , the former united states coach tony dicicco said but out there , she s devastating and that wo n't change this time , the team might not have her out there for as long united states coach jill ellis said sunday that morgan had recently looked great , sharp in practice , but would not say how she would use her in the opener all ellis said was that morgan would be available to play monday which does n't guarantee a thing but cryptic answers aside , ellis would be delirious not to call on morgan , who is at the center of what the united states team wants to do she is fast and mobile she is good in the air and technically solid but is she fit \? on saturday , morgan asked her 17 million twitter followers , who s ready for monday \? and answered , i am yet on sunday , both ellis and morgan acknowledged that morgan s fitness would be an issue morgan said it would take her several games to get up to speed when asked to name the last time she played a 90minute game , she initially said , i ca n't really remember if push comes to shove , i can play 90 minutes , she said , explaining that she might grow more fatigued than someone like abby wambach , but that she would still hang in there if called upon to start , i 'll be ready there is a good chance that morgan could start the tournament looking as dangerous as ever , but only in spurts her knee and her lungs may simply not be ready yet dicicco said the transition from a long layoff to game action would take some time the question is , does morgan have enough of it \? when you ca n't play as much , you 've got to use your mental training , dicicco said how much does that help \? it s player to player but if you 're going to take a chance on a player , you want to take a chance on alex morgan because she can change the game still , the fan chant that now follows united states national teams we believe that we will win ! may have to be modified , in morgan s case , to something more like , we just have to wait and see ! same rhythm not exactly the same punch brandi chastain , who scored the decisive penalty kick when the united states last lifted the world cup trophy , said she was sure her old team would n't be shaken by morgan s injury with morgan coming back , it s good for conversation , good for drama outside the team , but the inner circle knows that every player is valuable , chastain said , giving the example of how the united states' captain , christie rampone , earlier this year was replaced by the newcomer julie johnston , who has settled effortlessly into the starting lineup chastain also knows , of course , that it s not so simple to replace one player with another , because sometimes certain parts of a team are not interchangeable example if rampone , the most experienced american defender , is 85 percent back from her knee injury , should she regain her starting spot over a 100 percent johnston \? is a semifit morgan better than a fully fit abby wambach , whom ellis suggested last week might see some time as a lategame substitute \? those are questions that can be answered only by ellis , whose job i do n't envy as the united states tries to win its first world cup since 1999 that s a chess match that jill will have to play the whole time , chastain said , and one wrong move could change the whole outcome so do you start morgan , or do n't you \? chastain said no , unless morgan is 100 percent save her for when you need her the most but dicicco said you must she s the closest thing we 've had to mia hamm , dicicco said , adding that morgan as a starter was once a nobrainer , but has now become complicated at the worst possible time , too morgan is valuable because of her skill set and because her mobility opens up opportunities for other players but after not being able to go full speed for about eight weeks , she is n't very likely to be ready to literally hit the ground running even the world s best athletes have a period of transition between coming back from an injury and reaching their height again still , a part of the game with morgan is better than a whole game without morgan , right \? and being able to turn to wambach or sydney leroux off the bench is quite the backup plan what better way to kick off the world cup than with soccer s brightest star on the field , one who sparkles off it , too \? morgan might lift ratings , and higher ratings lure more sponsors and more sponsors mean more money and more money grows the game you know what else grows the game \? goals the united states , with a morganless starting lineup , failed to score any in their final exhibition , against a lessthanfearsome south korea in late may at red bull arena that underwhelming performance did little to inspire confidence that the americans would find the net when playing much better teams like or germany , if that time comes at the world cup and without that confidence even though morgan exudes it there goes the united states team s chance of bringing home its first world championship in 16 years so , no pressure , alex morgan no pressure
the transformation of pedro martinez from ferocious competitor to baseball sage is now complete in the last few months , martinez , the former star pitcher for the and four other teams , has analyzed the postseason for tbs , been elected to the hall of fame on his first try , joined mlb network and , this week , become an author the intellect behind the fire is on regular display a lot of people , when they saw me competing , they never saw the human being behind it , martinez said in a recent interview i'm totally different than they think , and i do n't know if they took the time to notice that i was totally different when i was n't pitching some people now are starting to put the pieces together martinez and his coauthor , michael silverman of the boston herald , assemble those pieces for more than 300 pages in pedro , published by houghton mifflin harcourt and set to be released tuesday from his boyhood in the dominican republic where he used the heads of his sister s dolls for baseballs and lived in a home with no refrigerator , tv or closets to his final game , for philadelphia in the 2009 world series , martinez chronicles a wild ride i think it s important for kids to understand that there s going to be adversity , and that even if you 're not looking for adversity , it will show up , martinez said , explaining why he wrote the book it s important that they see hope , and they see that they belong and there s no need to believe anybody that tells them , no , you ca n't' when the los angeles dodgers told martinez he was too frail to start and traded him to montreal , martinez won a cy young award when the expos could not afford him and sent him to boston , where he did not want to go martinez won two more when the red sox waited too long to offer a threeyear contract after their 2004 championship , the gave martinez four years his first new york season was mostly successful until , he said , jeff wilpon forced him to pitch in a game in late september when the mets were far out of the race martinez writes that his toe was hurt and that manager willie randolph had told him he was done for the season but , he said , wilpon , now the mets' chief operating officer , wanted to sell tickets for a matchup against the star marlins lefthander dontrelle willis martinez said he protested the order and offered to give back the rest of his contract while i'm the boss here , you 're going to have to do what i say , wilpon said , according to martinez , who gave in and pitched he lost the game , which drew 25 , 093 fans , and said the injury prolonged the toe problem other parts of his body broke down the next season , and martinez was inactive for the mets' run to game 7 of the 2006 national league championship series i could n't help but think about how when i was healthy in 2005 , our team was n't that good , martinez writes but as my health declined , i was urged to pitch a meaningless game at the end of 2005 that wound up shortening my recovery time for 2006 and led me to a hospital where doctors performed a threehour arthroscopic procedure to repair my shoulder in a statement through a spokesman , wilpon denied that he told martinez to pitch hurt pedro was always a great competitor and deserving of being in the hall of fame , the statement said this particular excerpt in the book is false as those kinds of decisions have always been put in the hands of our baseball people martinez said in the interview that he did not blame wilpon when you 're going to get hurt , you 're going to get hurt , he said i do n't have anybody to blame but probably myself for not listening to my body i think i was brave to pitch games , but i think i took it to extremes that day martinez was 3223 with a 388 earned run average in 79 starts for the mets over four seasons he stressed that he enjoyed every aspect of playing for the mets i was paid to pitch , so i went and did that , he said i did it whenever you asked me , whenever i could i wanted to do it for as long as i could , and that was my limit his actual limit , it turned out , came the next season with the phillies , and ended , appropriately , at the new yankee stadium martinez had some of his most memorable moments in the bronx , including the seventh game of the 2003 american league championship series , a few days after he had tossed the yankees coach don zimmer to the ground in a brawl although zimmer , then 73 , tearfully took the blame , martinez writes that the incident is his only regret fans sent him death threats , he writes , and it was not safe for his family to travel to new york for game 7 i do n't think i ever faced a game where my mind was so distressed by everything that was going on , martinez said in the interview the game , actually , got me more relaxed than anything , to get to the game and know that i was able to pitch and not have anything happen to me after having bodyguards in the room and everywhere i walked and my food had to be pretty much checked out by everybody that was a sense of relief of course , the red sox lost game 7 after manager grady little let martinez give up the lead in the fateful eighth inning that story is recounted in the book , a feisty memoir of a career that , at its peak and without the help of performanceenhancing drugs , martinez says was among the best ever during those five or maybe six years , i did n't feel intimidated by anybody regardless of what they were using or how they were doing it , martinez said i felt like i belonged and i could get you out the houston astros went 157 in april , their best record in the season s first month since 1986 , when they won their division they are leading the american league west now , after six consecutive losing seasons , but they already seemed to be rising before this season the astros improved by 19 wins from 2013 to 2014 , and added veterans in the offseason the tampa bay rays seemed to be trending the opposite way , after losing 85 games last season , then losing their general manager and manager they scored the fewest runs in the league last season , then traded matt joyce , wil myers and ben zobrist over the winter yet the rays have started well , with a winning record heading into the weekend after a month , they are a factor in the jumbled al east , and that was more than most people expected the grim forecast was understandable it s easy to overlook us , because there s not a whole lot of name recognition on the roster , not a whole lot of guys that have made a name for themselves yet or are well known in the public , said evan longoria , the rays' veteran third baseman so on paper we do n't look that great , and we 're young those two factors usually make for a rough going early on , and we 've found ways to be productive as a group the rays have managed about a leagueaverage offense but their starting rotation , led by chris archer and jake odorizzi , has been among the majors' best , and easily the best in the al east and they have done it without alex cobb and matt moore as far as the injuries we 've had , you 're not going to replace those guys , the type of pitchers they are , said manager kevin cash , who replaced joe maddon last winter the guys that we 've called on to help have definitely given us opportunities to win , so it s a credit to the front office and development people for getting those guys in position to be available drew smyly , who was sidelined early with shoulder trouble , has started twice and now has a 201 earned run average in nine starts for the rays since coming over from detroit in the david price deal last july cobb , who is recovering from forearm tendinitis , and moore , who had tommy john surgery last april , were scheduled to throw live batting practice this weekend longoria , the only remaining player from the rays' 2008 world series roster , said he trusted that the front office would continue to find ways to compete certainly now it does n't seem like we 're in what you would call a rebuilding phase , longoria said it seems like we 're putting a pretty competitive team out there and trying to win now when the texas rangers reacquired the troubled outfielder josh hamilton from the los angeles angels last week , it was only the latest example of a former most valuable player returning to the team for which he had won the award the rangers have to hope this reunion turns out better than most over the last 25 years , six other former mvps left their teams and returned later in their careers rickey henderson \( who won in 1990 for oakland \) , terry pendleton \( 1991 , atlanta \) , juan gonzalez \( 1996 and 1998 , texas \) , ken griffey jr \( 1997 , seattle \) , ivan rodriguez \( 1999 , texas \) and jason giambi \( 2000 , oakland \) henderson actually returned to the a s twice and led the al in steals and walks the second time , in 1998 the others had minimal success , including the two rangers gonzalez slugged 35 homers and drove in 140 runs for cleveland in 2001 but failed to match those totals , combined , over the next two seasons in texas rodriguez finished up the 2009 season with the rangers , at age 37 , and hit 245 in 28 games giambi batted 193 for oakland in 2009 griffey hit 19 homers for seattle that year , but none the next season , his last pendleton , who had helped carry the braves to two world series , missed their title season in 1995 after signing with the alsoran marlins he was traded back in august 1996 , hit 204 and retired two years later
ramche , nepal madhu badu had been on the road for the better part of three days , trying to get back to his native village , back to his wife and children , near the epicenter of s devastating earthquake northwest of katmandu his journey had begun on a bus , but the roads had become impassable and now he was on foot as he climbed a dirt path strewn with boulders and the muddy debris of landslides , hints of the devastation that awaited him in ramche greeted him like ominous signposts an elderly woman , groaning in pain , draped on the back of a man who was carrying her down the mountain a hamlet where residents were burying the dead piles of stone rubble where farmhouses once stood desperate residents appeared from the forests , pleading for help from mr badu and a journalist we lost everything ! cried one , baldev bhatta , his eyes bloodshot you are the first outsiders to come here we have no grain we have no money we cannot rebuild on our own you need to send this news to the world at each stop on the way up the mountain , farmers offered to show mr badu the ruins of their houses he pressed forward instead he knew his own family was safe he had tried calling his wife for four hours saturday before he finally got through but she said the village had been badly damaged and he was anxious to help across the countryside outside katmandu , tens if not hundreds of thousands of people are making similar desperate journeys , abandoning the jobs that had drawn them from home in better times and traveling through difficult terrain to get back to isolated villages like ramche that have been all but cut off from the world three days after nepal s worst earthquake in 80 years hit on saturday , the official death toll climbed past 5 , 000 and the prime minister , sushil koirala , said it could reach 10 , 000 but the extent of the destruction and loss of life in the countryside remained largely unknown here in the gorkha district , the epicenter of the magnitude 78 quake , roads that are repaired or cleared during the day are often blocked before the next morning by landslides , making it difficult to reach communities where hundreds are feared dead in a sign of progress , though , convoys of aid workers , some bearing the banners of nepalese companies , could be seen driving through the region on tuesday helicopters have also been ferrying the wounded out of the area when the quake struck , mr badu , 51 , was in solukhumbu , about 100 miles northeast of here , at a trekking station at the base of mount everest where he works in construction he spent the next two days on buses before beginning his trek at dawn on tuesday by foot he carried two plastic tarpaulins , a down jacket and a bag filled with apples and grapes it was part care package , part aid delivery before the earthquake , he said , life in the villages in this impoverished region had improved they had electricity and cellphone coverage , and the dirt roads were more or less acceptable but now there was no power , and communications were spotty in almost every hamlet on the way up to ramche , residents reported deaths from the quake at least in those places , none appeared to have suffered mass casualties finally , as mr badu approached ramche , a vista of destruction came into focus the village where he had grown up had been almost completely leveled on a bluff with sweeping views of the verdant valleys below , all that was left of the high school was a huge jumble of timber beams , slate roof tiles and broken stone walls almost every house had collapsed most people in the village of several hundred survived , but they were living under makeshift tents , much of their food supplies unreachable in their collapsed homes two seriously wounded women lay in a stable with the water buffaloes mr badu s home was one of the few left standing i imagined that my house was completely destroyed , he said i have food to eat the others have nothing while the conditions in remote ramche were particularly dire , even in the capital of katmandu , the scale of suffering was breathtaking , and a growing sense of frustration with the government was palpable although the government has established 16 large camps in the city , many other residents are making do by sleeping on the street or in open spaces away from damaged buildings and walls even in the tent camps , residents have complained that help is not reaching them or is arriving too slowly many accuse government officials of incompetence and neglect , and residents voice suspicions that officials are hoarding the aid supplies for themselves only this tent was provided by the government , but for everything else , we have had to rely on our own labors , said sudesh tulachan , a building worker and shop owner sheltering from the rain under a large canopy you can see how many humans are in need one of the biggest worries is that supplies of clean drinking water will run out , and that with many water pipes likely cracked , any water running from taps could be contaminated the government defended itself , saying that there are pressing needs everywhere , and that trying to get to villages that have had no government help was a priority and jamie mcgoldrick , the , said in a telephone interview that the bureaucracy has been a bit slow , but they did seem to get organized in the past 24 hours some relief organization workers also said that delivering help to villages was a physical challenge that would test any government mr mcgoldrick s office on monday that the earthquake had affected eight million people in the country , including two million in the 11 worst affected districts the geography is very , very difficult , peter oyloe , the director for nutrition for , said in a telephone interview in the devastated village of ramche , mr badu , visibly shaken , stopped in what used to be the courtyard of the high school , considering what might have happened if the earthquake had not struck on a saturday when its 500 students were off protruding from the rubble was a partly rolledup map , the kind used in geography classes , titled america political the only people in the building when the quake struck were 18 teachers in a training session one of them , netra prasad devkota , now stood in the courtyard holding a muddied copy of the materials they had been studying when the school started to crack into pieces i shouted , earthquake ! ' he recalled we all ran mr devkota and several others managed to escape from the school amid a huge cloud of dust but eight of the teachers were buried in the rubble four were killed , and four were later pulled alive from the debris a resident called a friend who is a helicopter pilot in the nepalese armed forces the pilot reached the village on sunday and evacuated the wounded teachers the pilot came out of friendship , said bumi nanda devkota , another native of ramche who had also rushed home there has been no help from the government since many residents survived the quake because they were working in the fields where they grow wheat and rice jhyali maya devkota , 63 , said she was inside her house , but lunged toward the door when the tremors began we were told to stand in the door frame , she said those were the instructions they always gave on television that is how i survived residents said no doctors had come to see their wounded , not even the women in the stable , the two most seriously injured people still in the village one of those women moaned miserably , her leg swollen and her foot wrapped in gauze the voice of poor people like us is not heard , said tejnath puddasin , her son mr badu said he felt very fortunate that his house survived the village had clean water , but grain from the last harvest had been largely in the ruins of the houses that collapsed residents still had vegetables and livestock , but were worried that they would not last long mr badu s wife , bishnu , returned home from the fields in the late morning to find her husband waiting for her this is big happiness for me , she said despite the reunion , though , she said she remained nervous the school collapsed , four teachers died , and i fear there will be more earthquakes , she said i do n't feel lucky
another season is scheduled to begin tuesday night , but not much has changed from the last one the western conference is again loaded with uptempo , starladen teams superficially at least , the east is about the luminary named lebron james and his quest for a sixth straight league finals appearance one longstanding mystery of the universe is the freewheeling style that took root in the west while the east embraced a more methodical brand of ball along conference lines , the geographical word association would be out west los angeles , denver , phoenix and golden state back east boston , detroit , new york and \( prelebron \) miami there have been exceptions , but by reputation the west has traditionally elevated the game as a more aesthetically pleasing form of entertainment while the east has prided itself as survival of the brawniest ask rod thorn , who has been around the pro game since 1963 , why that is , and he says , playfully , well , you know , the western part of the country is more about open spaces , and the east has the congested , more urban cities seriously , he doubted that athletic art had been imitating life more likely , he said , it has to do with the makeup of the coaches then again , mike d'antoni was an innovating celebrity with his precision fire drill of an offense in phoenix but a failure with it in new york and pat riley coached and the showtime lakers to four championships in los angeles , but when he moved into madison square garden with the knicks and later to miami , his teams nearly qualified for the olympics in grecoroman wrestling the eastwest divide probably originated in the early 1980s with the league s ultimate rivalry those johnsonandriley lakers whose architect was the aptly named jerry west and larry bird s lunchpail celtics those franchises were already the most historically successful , and as thorn said , this has always been a copycat league he added that after golden state won the championship in june , led by stephen curry s singleseason record barrage of 3pointers and with a highvoltage pace that had nba advocates in fullthroated cheer , we should expect the game to continue trending in the direction that credentialed oldschool folks like phil jackson and gregg popovich generally loathe but to cling stubbornly to the past is to fade away with it in an effort to eradicate the image of them as so 1990s , the knicks say they are planning to play a faster version of jackson s beloved triangle offense this season popovich years ago recalibrated his onceplodding offense to feature the pacepushing skills of tony parker in winning the 2014 finals over miami , the launched more 3pointers \( averaging 236 per game \) than any titlewinning team in history until curry and the warriors fired them up at a clip of 31 a game in disposing of james and his cleveland cavaliers last june we all know if you do n't shoot the 3 , you 're probably not going to win , popovich said last spring everybody in the league shoots the 3point shot well and knows the importance i still hate it shooting the 3 at last season s rate an average of 225 per game does not require a commitment to a speedball game , as teams increasingly space the floor in their halfcourt offenses and use driveandkick penetration to free up longrange marksmen but thorn said the spread of uptempo play around the east was inevitable it used to be that no matter how fast teams played in the regular season , the feeling was that the game would slow down in the playoffs , thorn said with golden state playing the way they did , i'm not so sure people are thinking that anymore he knows that jason kidd is n't buying into any old eastwest divergence as he begins his second season as the coach in milwaukee the bucks are blessed with one of the game s best young endtoend athletes in giannis antetokounmpo , along with jabari parker , expected back soon after knee surgery last winter , and point guard michael carterwilliams with the addition of greg monroe to score and pass from the post , kidd s team , which opens its season at home wednesday night against the knicks , could pose an intriguing challenge to james and the cavaliers , along with last season s contenders chicago , washington , atlanta and toronto thorn will be in milwaukee for the opener after retiring from the nba s executive office last spring at 74 , he thought he was out until kidd pulled him back in , hiring him as a consultant kidd was part of thorn s secondmostimpactful player transaction as a team frontoffice executive \( next to drafting michael jordan in chicago \) when thorn brought kidd a passfirst point guard to the nets in 2001 from phoenix in a trade for stephon marbury with the ball in kidd s hands , the nets made two consecutive finals , mixing a quicker pace with a version of the princeton halfcourt offense curry and the warriors may be the rage , but none of their four playoff opponents last season were at full strength , and thorn is old and wise enough to know that embracing one style does not , or should not , necessarily negate another before the playoffs began , west , now a warriors consultant , told thorn that the one team he feared was the jerry thought they had the size and ability to control pace in a way the other teams could n't , thorn said to that end , the spurs are stronger inside with the additions of lamarcus aldridge and david west in oklahoma city , what restores the thunder as a serious threat , beyond the presumed health of kevin durant and russell westbrook , is the frontline athleticism provided by serge ibaka , steven adams and enes kanter , the kind of lowpost scorer the team has lacked even by old eastwest standards , thorn noted , the truly great teams are those not easily typecast , as demonstrated by jackson s six title teams in chicago and five with the lakers go back to those bird teams they did n't have fast guys , but they knew how to run a pretty good fast break , thorn said and the showtime lakers , he added , could always slow the game down and throw it inside he referred to kareem abduljabbar , the league s career leading scorer
carnegie hall s groundbreaking earlymusic festival , a varied and eventful journey , ended on friday evening more or less where it had begun on april 7 , in the young but ebullient world of 17thcentury italian opera john eliot gardiner and his , after a grand performance of monteverdi s 1610 vespers in carnegie s stern auditorium on thursday evening , brought down the curtain \( and the house \) there with a concert performance of monteverdi s first opera , l'orfeo , of 1607 taken together , those performances constituted a significant event in themselves for the performers , this was the culmination of a twoweek american tour , a sort of sentimental journey appended to last year s commemorations of the 50th anniversary of the founding of the monteverdi choir and orchestra by mr gardiner with a performance of the 1610 vespers in 1964 \( he disbanded the moderninstrument monteverdi orchestra in 1978 , replacing it with the english baroque soloists , using period instruments or replicas \) for carnegie , the concerts made a resplendent finale to its new festival apart from an afternoon of purcell opera performed by the canadian band les violons du roy on april 12 , these were the only concerts presented in the large stern auditorium , which can be a problematic space for smallscale chamber or earlymusic concerts mr gardiner has always favored a gutty , fullbodied approach to monteverdi s music to some extent , he has written in bach music in the castle of heaven \( 2013 \) , the monteverdi choir started life as an antichoir in reaction to the wellmannered euphony and blend favored in certain british circles at the time their mantra , he adds , was never louder than lovely for the carnegie vespers , he often encouraged the magnificent chorus , 34 strong , to sing at full shout though undeniably powerful , this somewhat blunt approach in carnegie s bright , clear acoustics may not always have best served music that delights in echo effects and thrives on churchy reverberation , a sound that seems to emanate from dark corners bearing a mystery , a mood , an atmosphere mr gardiner did achieve fascinating spatial effects at times , dispatching a vocal soloist and chitarrone \( longnecked lute \) accompanist to a side or rear balcony and the soloists , drawn from the choir , were mostly superb , none more so than the soprano francesca aspromonte and the tenor andrew tortise but there were also disappointments , in the great aria nigra sum \( i am dark \) , which has often been done in new york with greater artistry , in productions by the green mountain project and others , and in the flagging energy and control of the cornetto playing toward the end of the evening \( can there be a more difficult instrument to play than the cornetto \? \) with all due respect to carnegie s formative role in the enterprise , the stern auditorium may also not have been the ideal place to hear the production of l'orfeo in fact , mr gardiner and company performed the work in the intimate richardson auditorium at princeton university \( some 900 seats against carnegie s 2 , 800 \) on wednesday evening to better effect the opera , based in mythology , unfolds amid a thracian community of shepherds orfeo marries euridice euridice , bitten by a snake , dies suddenly orfeo is allowed to reclaim her from the underworld on a seemingly simple condition that he fails to meet euridice is gone again , but monteverdi s version , unlike others , is fitted out with a happy ending the gardiner performance offered elements of light staging characters moving about , interacting , even dancing it drew a listener in , more in the richardson s close quarters than in carnegie s broader spaces as it happened , the casting changed slightly from richardson to carnegie , too , though a program insert at carnegie failed to register the changes ms aspromonte , who sang a variety of roles in princeton \( music , euridice , hope \) traded assignments with mariana flores \( the messenger there \) as fine as ms flores was in those larger roles , ms aspromonte was somewhat missed still , her portrayal of the bringer of bad news was lustrous from its opening phrases and ultimately haunting inevitably , though , the real star of the production was the tenor krystian adam , who sailed through the long and difficult part of orfeo on both evenings mr tortise was again excellent , as the ubiquitous first shepherd and apollo of before bach s 13 concerts , i caught eight , and they were uniformly excellent in execution if not all completely to my taste oddly the biggest letdown came from the group i anticipated most , those master improvisers of l'arpeggiata , who followed a revelatory cavalli evening with another purcellbased program , which often descended into watery jazz or new age in a similar imbalance , jordi savall s solo program on viola da gamba conveyed much deeper emotion and insight than the fairly routine program of french baroque works that he led with his les concert des nations i caught only one of the tallis scholars' two concerts , but it was a beauty , a program that grew out a weeklong workshop for preprofessional singers , who helped populate a performance of thomas tallis s 40part motet , spem in alium \( that performance took place in the church of st ignatius loyola , which might have better served mr gardiner s monteverdi vespers \) you have to hope that carnegie , with blessed access to such toplevel performers , will return to this theme or one like it soon but you also have to hope that it will widen its net a bit to include more american performers the only native group represented here was the choir pomerium in a modest concert in weill recital hall carnegie s interest in early music , american style , seems to remain regrettably shallow
white sulphur springs , wva the only other time appeared in the greenbrier classic , he was coming off his third victory of the 2012 season and had not posted a score higher than 75 all year he carded a 71 and a 69 on the par70 old white tpc course and did not make the cut woods returned this week with a head of steam too weak to move a ball off the tee , and opened with a 66 on thursday go figure it was his best firstround score in 22 months , and , at fourunder , it equaled his lowest score relative to par this year i know people think i'm crazy for saying that , but i just felt like i was n't that far away , said woods , who dismissed the notion that he had proved anything to anybody with the good start all that mattered to him was that he was four strokes behind the pacesetter , scott langley forget you guys and everybody else out there , woods said , laughing it s about winning golf tournaments and putting myself up there consistently woods , whose most recent victory on the pga tour was in august 2013 , hit six of seven fairways on his first nine , and strung together three birdies to end his round the birdie binge followed a double bogey on the par4 sixth , the particulars of which have become par for woods s season after he drove into the left rough , woods caromed his second shot off a tree branch and into a bunker he bladed his next shot , missed the green with a flop shot , chipped to 5 feet and made the putt to fall to one under on the next hole , as he walked to the patch of rough where his drive had landed , woods said he told his caddie , joe lacava , that he was hitting the ball too well to be only one under on a course made pincushion soft by rain i was telling joey that i felt like i was playing so well , i'm not going to lose this round , woods said as if to prove his point , woods cut his approach around a tree to inside 4 feet and made the putt that was a good one , he said , adding , overall , i ca n't really say i hit any great shots , but i hit a lot of good ones woods , 39 , found 10 fairways and 14 greens and took 25 putts he was one of the few people who saw this kind of score on the horizon in may , when he was struggling to an 85 in the third round of the memorial tournament , or two weeks ago , when he opened with an 80 at the on his way to missing the cut in a major he has won three times my feels were telling me that i was n't that far off , woods said i was proving it to myself time and time again away from a tournament site and on the range , but my feel in my hands and my body were n't far off it was just a matter of just getting into a little bit of the rhythm and the flow of it , and i found that that woods is relying on his feel and trusting the feedback he gets from his hands and his body instead of relying on numbers spit out of a computer tracking his swing is good news to those who remember when his focus was solely on getting around a course in as few strokes as possible back in woods s native california , rudy duran , who was woods s first coach , said , tiger was a genius at scoring when he was 5 years old , and he still is speaking by telephone , duran added , when tiger was a kid we mostly played golf and did things that helped him play better very little was swingrelated duran , who coached woods until he was 10 but has not been in contact with him recently , caught snippets of the telecast , including a few of woods s shots in his rounds of 80 and 76 i do n't believe he s lost , duran said during the open i can see what he s struggling with i still totally believe once he gets it sorted out , he 'll start playing great again on thursday , the fans who flocked to the rainsoaked greenbrier resort to follow woods saw rays of hope break through the clouds that have hung over woods on the golf course for the better part of a year after woods made his first birdie , on the par5 12th , one fan yelled , looking good today , champ after woods s third birdie , on the 16th , another fan shouted , he s back since may 2014 , woods has toppled from no 1 in the world to no 220 his 219spot plummet in about 400 days has caused widespread analysis of his game and his mental state woods said he had paid attention to none of it i know what i am doing out here on the golf course , he said wednesday i know what it feels like i know where my game is and what progressions i have or have n't made after thursday s round , woods saw more signs he is moving in the right direction it was a pretty good day , he said

did not respond to several messages left at their homes john delgado , a lawyer representing the family , said , they are still grieving and at loss to explain this horrific incident this year , mr roof had at least three encounters with the local police in february , he attracted attention at a shopping mall when , dressed in black , he asked store employees about how many people were working

police officer questioned him for loitering at a park and found semiautomatic rifle parts in his car trunk , but he was not charged in april , mr roof was arrested at the same shopping mall , where he

father had given him for his 21st birthday last week , the fbi said from making the purchase because he had admitted to possessing drugs , but a breakdown in the backgroundcheck process allowed the

he added roof s father and grandfather both live in neighborhoods where they are surrounded by africanamericans , mr rutherford said dylann roof can be racist if he wanted to , but he would have had to have done it in his house benn roof liked hosting parties and often invited his black and hispanic employees , one former neighbor said several former neighbors , none of whom wished to have their names used because they did not want to be associated with the case , said the same thing the roofs were as normal as normal could be yet a website that mr roof created included photographs of him with patches from whiteruled african governments on his clothes and others of him waving the confederate battle flag he sported the number 88 on his clothes , which appeared to be a reference to the white supremacist code for heil hitler on that website , investigators say , he posted a 2 , 500word essay that complained bitterly about black crime , citing incidents described on the website of the council of conservative citizens , a white supremacist group he also praised segregation , saying , integration has done nothing but bring whites down to the level of brute animals a lot of people feel children learn that , they are taught intolerance and discrimination , ms devine said i do n't feel that is something joe roof would have taught or tolerated someone had to teach him that so

2015 was , of course , the year of donald trump , whose rise has inspired horror among establishment republicans and , let s face it , glee call it among many democrats but trumpism has in one way worked to the gop establishment s advantage it has distracted pundits and the press from the hard right turn even conventional republican candidates have taken , a turn whose radicalism would have seemed implausible not long ago after all , you might have expected the debacle of george w bush s presidency a debacle not just for the nation , but for the republican party , which saw democrats both take the white house and achieve some major parts of their agenda to inspire some reconsideration of wtype policies what we 've seen instead is a doubling down , a determination to take whatever did n't work from 2001 to 2008 and do it again , in a more extreme form start with the example that s easiest to quantify , tax cuts big tax cuts tilted toward the wealthy were the bush administration s signature domestic policy they were sold at the time as fiscally responsible , a matter of giving back part of the budget surplus america was running when w took office \( infamously argued that tax cuts were needed to avoid paying off federal debt too fast \) since then , however , overthetop warnings about the evils of debt and deficits have become a routine part of republican rhetoric and even conservatives occasionally admit that soaring inequality is a problem moreover , it s harder than ever to claim that tax cuts are the key to prosperity at this point the private sector has added more than twice as many under president obama as it did over the corresponding period under w , a period that does n't include the great recession you might think , then , that bushstyle tax cuts would be out of favor in fact , however , establishment candidates like marco rubio and jeb bush are proposing than w ever did and independent analysis of jeb s proposal shows that it s toward the wealthy than anything his brother did what about other economic policies \? the bush administration s determination to dismantle any restraints on banks at one staged event , a top official used on stacks of regulations looks remarkably bad in retrospect but conservatives have bought into the thoroughly narrative that government somehow caused the great recession , and all of the republican candidates have declared their determination to repeal doddfrank , the fairly modest set of regulations imposed after the financial crisis the only real move away from wera economic ideology has been on monetary policy , and it has been a move toward rightwing fantasyland true , ted cruz is alone among the top contenders in calling explicitly for a return to the gold standard you could say that he wants to cruzify mankind upon a cross of gold \( sorry \) but where the bush administration once endorsed to fight recessions , these days hostility toward the fed s efforts to help the economy is gop orthodoxy , even though the right s warnings about imminent inflation have been wrong again and again last but not least , there s foreign policy you might have imagined that the story of the iraq war , where we were not , in fact , welcomed as liberators , where a vast expenditure of blood and treasure left the middle east less stable than before , would inspire some caution about military force as the policy of first resort yet swaggerandbomb posturing is more or less universal among the leading candidates and let s not forget that back when jeb bush was considered the frontrunner , he assembled a foreignpolicy team literally dominated by e in iraq the point is that while the mainstream contenders may have better manners than mr trump or the widely loathed mr cruz , when you get to substance it becomes clear that all of them are frighteningly radical , and that none of them seem to have learned anything from past disasters why does this matter \? right now conventional wisdom , as captured by suggests even or betterthaneven odds that mr trump or mr cruz will be the nominee , in which case everyone will be aware of the candidate s extremism but there s still a substantial chance that the outsiders will falter and someone less obviously out there probably mr rubio will end up on top and if this happens , it will be important to realize that not being donald trump does n't make someone a moderate , or even halfway reasonable the truth is that there are no moderates in the republican primary , and being reasonable appears to be a disqualifying characteristic for anyone seeking the party s nod
georgetown , guyana swaying to the rhythms of afroguyanese reggae , the protesters , descendants of african slaves and indentured laborers from india , gathered on the streets of georgetown in a show of unity against the country s president a few years ago , a gathering of members of s two main ethnic groups , which have long been at opposite ends of the country s political divide , would have been unusual but the protest in november , after president donald ramotar in order to fend off a noconfidence motion , reflected an important change taking place in this tiny englishspeaking country of just 740 , 000 people perched on the shoulder of south america politics in guyana have long been delineated by race but a multiethnic movement that has emerged in recent years has given voice to a new generation of guyanese who say that politics as usual has held the country back by favoring race over merit , undermining economic progress this shows the true reality of guyana now , marcia de costa , 37 , a manager of a beauty salon , said , pointing toward the diverse crowd at the rally this is new for us the two main political parties in guyana have traditionally hewed to racial lines one drawing support from the descendants of africans brought over by the dutch in the 17th century , and the other from the descendants of the indians brought by the british a couple of centuries later but the emergence of a third party in recent years has changed the dynamics the party , , seeks to cut across racial lines and has drawn support from both afro and indoguyanese , as well as members of indigenous groups it emerged as a real political force during the elections of 2011 , cutting into the support of the two main parties mr ramotar s people s progressive party , which is dominated by indoguyanese , fell short of a majority the multiracial party along with the main opposition party , the afroguyanesedominated partnership for national unity proceeded to block many of mr ramotar s initiatives tensions rose last year when alliance for change said it would call for a noconfidence vote against the president in a dispute over government spending mr ramotar halted the motion by invoking a provision of the constitution that allows the president to suspend parliament for up to six months , infuriating the opposition and leading to a string of street protests what i have done is given democracy a better opportunity to breathe , mr ramotar said at the time , adding that he hoped the move would provide an opportunity for talks between his government and the opposition , though none have taken place yet despite the president s move to suspend parliament , there is hope within alliance for change that the country has moved into a new era of more inclusionary politics people realized that racialized politics in this country will carry us nowhere , said khemraj ramjattan , 54 , who left mr ramotar s party and helped found the multiethnic group they now realize that we have to start dealing with issues yet despite its gains , it is not clear if mr ramjattan s party can do much more than act as a spoiler in the sparring between the two main parties or if it can come up with solutions of its own to revive the economy and promote growth much of its platform consists of general calls for transparency and constitutional reform guyana gained its independence from britain in 1966 in the first three decades of independence , an afroguyanese group controlled the government but in 1992 , the indoguyanese party gained the upper hand in the country s first free and fair elections in that period , and it has controlled parliament and the presidency ever since that has led to widespread resentment among afroguyanese , who say they have been shut out of government and business , just as the indoguyanese said they were before coming to power there are more indoguyanese than afroguyanese in the country a 2002 census reported that 43 percent of the population was of indian descent and 30 percent of african descent the country remains one of the poorest in the region its main sources of wealth are sugar , timber and bauxite , as well as gold and diamonds guyana s governments have experienced an array of corruption scandals , encompassing things like procurement and unfinished building projects frustration with the status quo , particularly corruption , helped fuel desire for a political alternative defectors from both major parties formed the new multiracial party in 2004 the country is suffering because we are not all working together in this racial divide , said moses nagamootoo , a leader of alliance for change who was among the prime movers of the noconfidence motion seated at his desk in his georgetown office , mr ramotar said that he did not think the political standoff was because of a changing society rather , he said , the crisis is a result of maneuvering by an upstart opposition seeking to gain power mr ramotar has pledged to use the time that parliament is suspended to engage in dialogue with his opponents i owe it to the people of this country to offer a possibility that we do n't descend into rancor and give ourselves a possibility to reach a compromise and move forward , he said but he added that if it came to a noconfidence vote and new elections , he was sure that his party would remain in the majority and that he would continue as president the opposition has said it will move its noconfidence motion as soon as parliament reconvenes , so it is likely that elections will take place in the coming months given mr ramotar s dwindling popularity and a string of corruption scandals that have hit his government , there is a good chance that the current afroguyanese opposition could be elected , ending more than two decades of indoguyanese rule yet they may , thanks to the increased power of the multiethnic party , be forced to become more inclusive , said vibert cambridge , a professor of communications at ohio university that ethnopolitical base will remain , but it will lose its salience over time this is a manifestation of what hopefully is the end of ethnopolitics in guyana , he said it may well be a pivotal moment in guyanese 21stcentury history leaders of alliance for change hope that a growing mixedrace population will become part of its natural base and help it build support its message appears to have particular appeal to younger voters , who may have seen more of the world and want to change things at home that generation is questioning this kind of traditional politics , mr cambridge said
kudos for \( front page , june 14 \) , about the eric garner case the prosecutors depicted sounded more like lawyers defending the police than prosecutors seeking to do justice the article thereby confirmed the concerns of many legal ethicists because of a conflict of interest , prosecutors investigating the police officers they work with on a daily basis are sometimes actually protecting them , perhaps unconsciously when that potential conflict is buttressed by actual evidence that the prosecutors did not fulfill their public role , as in the garner case , gov andrew m cuomo can and should resolve all doubts in favor of appointing a special prosecutor to seek an indictment once again a second grand jury could still be empaneled because constitutional double jeopardy does not apply to grand juries the point is not to blame staten island prosecutors for a bad result \( police officers , like others , are presumed innocent \) it is to recognize that everyone will benefit from a special prosecutor untainted by conflict of interest benjamin c zipursky scarsdale , ny your report on the eric garner case highlights the inadequacy of the grand jury secrecy rule and how it undermines , in effect , the sixth amendment requirement of public trials in criminal cases the garner case is a complex one , and a public proceeding is an important tool to help parse that complexity the problem is that a trial has essentially already taken place behind closed doors , out of the hearing of the victim s family , the press and the public no one except the grand jurors , the prosecutors and a judge know who testified , what evidence was submitted or what the grand jurors were instructed about the law how different this is from a criminal trial , where all that information is open to the public how sadly similar it is to trials in undemocratic countries where all one knows are the charges and the verdict none of the traditional reasons given for grand jury secrecy support keeping the garner process secret no one can interfere any longer with the witnesses or the investigation , and the fear of flight by the police officers , whose identities are known , is nonexistent all secrecy accomplishes is keeping the facts from the public and letting the mystery of what actually happened linger continued secrecy does a disservice to the cause of justice joseph c kaplan teaneck , nj
las vegas you watch the crash because you want to see how it will end near miss or carnage , relief or horror , laughter or tears part of the appeal is the feeling of helplessness you are a viewer , but not an agent whatever happens , you 'll be affected , but you ca n't chart the course and looking away is never the right choice in the case of lateperiod mariah carey , it s the high notes that you ca n't avert your eyes and ears from when she began her career in the early 1990s , she was capable of outrageous vocal feats , singing whole octaves higher than almost everyone else , stringing together dogpitch bleats into ecstatic runs she brought something superhuman into the otherwise grounded world of popsoul but the notes have not been there for ms carey of late some performances have been markedly offbase , the subject of intense scrutiny ms carey is still durable , and sometimes excellent , but her oncetranscendent voice is like decaying manufacturing machinery it still churns , but the product might be polished or dinged you do n't know until it happens on wednesday night , ms carey performed for a largely difficult two hours at the colosseum at caesars palace here , the first show in what s to be totaling more than 50 concerts that she s embarking upon something like this is already a sign of defeat the show consists of her 18 no 1 billboard hits , and the last of those came in 2008 \( there s a new song , too , called infinity it wo n't be no 19 \) but ms carey , 45 , has long had a taste for the outsized and gauche , and vegas , with its grandeur and glitz , seemed like just the place to find redemption her portrait , airbrushed and glamorous , graces the covers of las vegas and vegas player magazines , which are laid out on coffee tables in hotel rooms across town last month , at the rollout event for her residency , she arrived in a pink 1936 convertible trailed by 18 billboard trucks bearing the names of each of the hits she would be performing maybe the new performance spectacle could resurrect the old vocal spectacle when it came to the notes , though , the struggle was real from the beginning of the night , she was tentative and inconsistent she sang parts of several songs an octave lower than the recordings often she appeared to be holding back , as if to build up to a big moment , only to shy away from it as she s aged , her voice has gotten huskier , but sometimes the rasp felt like a glitch , not a goal on power ballads like i do n't wanna cry and love takes time , she vacillated between hitting big notes and whiffing the same happened on her jackson 5 cover i 'll be there , sung with her longtime backup singer trey lorenz they famously performed a blistering of this song on mtv unplugged in 1992 , but here mr lorenz appeared to be restraining himself so as not to overpower the boss on faster songs , like dreamlover , honey and fantasy , ms carey was practically tiptoeing fantasy featured ol' dirty bastard , who died in 2004 , rapping via video , and he felt more alive than ms carey , who was right there onstage none of this changes the fact that , somewhere in there , ms carey has one of the greatest pop voices of the last three decades in the first half of the 1990s , she was unstoppable in the second half , very close to that she had at least one no 1 song each year of that decade las vegas has become a safe haven for setting stars , from celine to shania to britney ms carey s arrival here was practically inscribed in stone and yet , in the relatively fallow period since she last topped the charts , she s made some strong music , especially on \( def jam \) , from last year carey has a new record deal , with epic , and a hits collection , 1 to infinity , due this month \) but there s no room for that in this show performing her no 1s in chronological order is a convenient conceit , but not one best suited to ms carey s catalog , or her vocal gift she seemed to be holding back on uptempo songs so as to have something to give on slower ones with fewer places to hide hits like the elegant ca n't let go and the breezy shake it off did n't make the cut all in all , this show displayed a minimum of imagination and effort , from the song order although she did rally near the end , on we belong together and do n't forget about us to the strategically lethargic band to the constant reminders of the things ms carey was n't doing during his introduction , the show s director , ken ehrlich , ran down a list of behindthescenes people mariah s asked me to thank them for her and it was mr lorenz s task to introduce the dancers and band members even ms carey s movements were kept to a minimum several times , she was wheeled out on stage singing in a pink convertible , singing on a jet ski , singing on a round bed she stood the most still when she was aiming the highest not for the runofthemill big notes , but the stratospheric ones that made her untouchable 25 years ago she has a routine before she sings them , she pauses for a bit , puts her hand to her eardrum , then points to the sky as the laserlike shrieks come out all those gestures were there during this show at the end of emotions , and on heartbreaker and on i 'll be there but as the night wore on , it became increasingly unclear whether the sounds coming through the speakers were coming from her mouth they were crisp and clean , while many of her lesser notes were gruff and unsteady it s possible she shines most at the highest difficulty level , but it s more probable that to fail at those places would have been too great a tragedy to bear and so went this show , which was far more about defense than offense whether the decision to undertake this project was born of necessity , hubris or obliviousness , it has put ms carey in a precarious position she is in decline and trapped in a cage of her own making it would be so much easier to turn away if the spotlight were n't so bright

like many retirees , one couple from upstate new york visit doctors in their winter getaway in florida but on a recent routine checkup of a pacemaker , a cardiologist there insisted on scheduling several expensive tests even though the 91yearold husband had no symptoms you walk in the door , and they just start doing things , said sally spencer , 70 , who canceled the tests after her husband s longtime doctor advised her by phone that none of them were needed the couple s experience reflects a trend that has prompted some doctors up north to warn their older patients before they depart for florida and other winter getaways to check in before agreeing to undergo exams and procedures and some patients have learned to be leery after being subjected to tests and expenses that longtrusted physicians at home never suggested medical testing is a huge industry in the united states , with prices that are highly variable and while the government insurance program for those over 65 or with disabilities strictly regulates the price of tests and procedures , doctors who treat seniors can increase revenues by simply expanding the volume of such services and ordering tests of questionable utility in some areas where many retirees live , most notably florida , the data suggests that they do in 2012 , according to a new york times analysis of data released last year , more than twice the number of nuclear stress tests , echocardiograms and vascular ultrasounds were ordered per medicare beneficiary in doctor s offices in florida than in massachusetts when researchers from dartmouth last year looked at the number of tests and imaging studies received by florida medicare patients in the last two years of life , with the exception of the panhandle , totals were far above the national average , said dr elliott fisher , director of the dartmouth institute for health policy and clinical practice other areas that showed high rates of testing and imaging in the study included arizona , california , southern nevada and south texas , all also popular for sunseeking retirees new jersey and new york city also scored high , though , too those high numbers cannot be explained by the presence of sicker patients , better outcomes or a desire by patients there for more treatment , dr fisher s studies have found he added it s mostly based on how much doctors do in a system where you make more by doing more financial incentives and more entrepreneurial doctors are very important to what we 're seeing many cardiologists in florida practice careful medicine and do not perform unusually high numbers of tests , of course dr a allen seals , president of the florida chapter of the american college of cardiology , said in an email that testing should be based on evidencebased guidelines at the point of care while accounting for individual patient preferences and values he noted that the american board of internal medicine s included questions patients could ask if referred for cardiac testing some extra testing may be understandable as doctors see new patients and may not have full access to prior records or trust testing performed elsewhere last year , the north shorelong island jewish health system signed a threeyear affiliation agreement with boca raton regional hospital in part to provide better continuity of care for patients who live in both areas but florida has emerged over the years as an epicenter of medicare abuse the a joint initiative of the department of health and human services and the department of justice , was formed in response to widespread fraudulent claims in south florida , and its periodic takedowns have charged than in the other cities where it operates and highvolume testing is also a good way for physicians to supplement income when insurers are cutting back on payments for individual services from 1999 to 2008 , as medicare reduced reimbursement for many cardiology services , found that the number of medicare claims soared for the types of testing recommended to ms spencer s husband claims for echocardiograms \( which use sound waves to produce pictures of the heart s wall and valves \) increased by 90 percent peripheral vascular ultrasound tests \( which look for clogged arteries \) nearly tripled nuclear stress testing \( a complex test for coronary artery disease \) more than tripled , even though the procedure takes hours , involves an injection and radiation exposure , and costs thousands of dollars doctors now often own the testing equipment or have a stake in a center where testing is performed medicare law generally forbids such selfreferral because studies show it encourages overuse of services \( while studies have not looked specifically at testing in florida , there , by christine yee , an economist at the university of california , berkeley , showed that physicians who were on the boards of ambulatory surgery centers did 27 percent more procedures than those who were not \) but the law permits an exception for inoffice ancillary services directly related to care as doctors have moved more equipment and technology into their offices , that oncelimited category has grown to include a wide range of tests , from xrays to expensive cardiac testing to suites where biopsies can be performed some patients cite episodes that make them apprehensive about finding new physicians one of the things i worry about most is leaving my doctors , said eugene levich , who is selling his house in liberty , ny , and moving full time to delray beach , fla , where he and his wife have long wintered people are old they 've just moved so it s very easy for doctors and dentists to take advantage of this population and they do after mr levich had a routine prostate exam in florida last year , the doctor there told him that he should have a surgical biopsy mr levich delayed until he could see his physician in new york , who told him that there was no reason for the procedure likewise , when mr levich went to an ear , nose and throat doctor in florida because his ear felt clogged after an infection , he told the doctor that he had no trouble hearing the physician nonetheless immediately ordered a hearing test , and urged him to schedule an mri as well instead , mr levich went to a pharmacy and bought a nasal spray that cleared up his problem despite the financial protection against high charges for individual tests offered by medicare , outofpocket payments can quickly add up , since the government insurance generally requires a 20 percent copayment for outpatient care mike miller , 74 , who splits his year between maryland and florida , said that when possible he sought recommendations from his doctors at johns hopkins in baltimore you do n't visit doctors in florida unless you have really good references from other doctors or people who are really trustworthy , he added he said he had found excellent surgeons and eye doctors this way but when he visited a cardiologist to check out a slow heart beat \( one he has had all his life \) he was soon undergoing the same three tests as those prescribed to ms spencer s husband as well as being placed on a 24hour heart rhythm monitor they were aggressive in encouraging me to have tests even though my doctors in the north never said i needed them , he said and of course the results were all

is blaming a headache for his early exit from last sunday s loss to seattle steelers coach mike tomlin says his franchise quarterback has a concussion either way , roethlisberger will remain under the nflmandated concussion protocol this week as pittsburgh prepares to face indianapolis we will do what we always do with those guys , tomlin said tuesday we will be very diligent about their care we will lean on the expert advice of our medical team , who always does a great job tomlin s remarks contrasted with roethlisberger s comments on his weekly radio appearance on a pittsburgh radio station he described his condition as a traumatic ocular migraine that limited his peripheral vision browns quarterback josh mccown broke his collarbone in monday night s lastsecond loss to baltimore , an injury that will cost him the final five games this season and reopen quarterback chaos in cleveland with the browns in a short week before facing cincinnati , coach mike pettine still has n't decided if he 'll reinsert johnny manziel , recently benched for offfield antics , into the starting lineup or stick with austin davis , who replaced the injured mccown in the fourth quarter the nfl has moved the referee pete morelli s crew off the coming sunday night game between indianapolis and pittsburgh instead , the crew will work an afternoon game between the eagles and the patriots morelli s group was heavily criticized by both sides after the 49erscardinals game sunday arizona coach bruce arians said the officials ca n't count to three there were a combined 20 penalties in the game the arizona cardinals have placed running back chris johnson on the injured reserve designated to return list by being on the list , johnson , whose left leg is injured , ca n't resume practice for six weeks and ca n't play in a game for eight weeks johnson , 30 , is fourth in the nfl in rushing with 812 yards after two decades without a team in los angeles , the nfl is barreling toward a decision to put at least one team back in the nation s secondlargest market the committee of owners charged with recommending which team or teams may be eligible to move there will hold another meeting in january to consider the two proposals on the table the plan by the owner stan kroenke to build a stadium in inglewood , calif , and the plan by the owners of the and the to build their own shared stadium in carson , calif none of the three teams have applied to move yet , and there is no guarantee the los angeles committee will vote on either of the two proposals in january but john mara , a coowner of the giants and a member of the committee , told reporters at an owners' meeting in irving , tex , that it s time to get this done like mara , the other owners do not want the selection process to drag on too long because it would mean less time for a new team to prepare to play in los angeles many owners continue to waver on which choice they support jerry jones , the dallas cowboys' owner , has been a vocal supporter of kroenke s plan for the rams , while jerry richardson of the carolina panthers has said he supports the proposal put forward by the chargers and the raiders few other owners have been as precise away from the owners' meeting tuesday , jones said he thought los angeles could support two stadiums while that is technically feasible , the league would most likely balk at such a plan because of the additional costs the league is going to lengths to ensure that the rams , the raiders and the chargers give their host cities time to try to keep the teams from leaving
edison , nj motorists traveling southbound on interstate 95 out of manhattan will pass rory mcilroy , who gazes down at them from a billboard promoting the barclays at plainfield country club the pga tour s version of the postseason begins here thursday without mcilroy , a former world no 1 who essentially gave himself a firstround bye he skipped the event to reduce strain on his healed left ankle and save his energy for the last three official events of the wraparound season , ranked 10th , also took a pass martin kaymer is not playing , although not by choice kaymer is no 20 in the world rankings , but in the pga tour s , he finished 139th kaymer s downfall was twofold he built into his schedule a vacation because none currently exists in professional golf , taking the first two months of 2015 off to recharge after a 2014 campaign in which he won the and the players championship kaymer s second mistake , as it were , was posting his best results in events not operated by the pga tour he finished tied for 12th in the last two majors of the season , the british open and the pga championship , where no more points are awarded to the winners than at the tour s flagship event , the players and he produced two fourthplace showings and a third on the european tour , at events where he received no fedex cup points if this stretch at the end of a marathon season is truly being conducted to showcase the best golfers in the world , why is kaymer at home while 144thranked jason gore finished safely inside the top 125 , at no 98 \? is it a meritbased playoff race or one that rewards mean results on the pga tour \? on wednesday , gore was asked what he made of the fact that he was in this week s field and kaymer was not there is one saying for it , but i probably ca n't say it here , he said i guess to be politically correct , it s a shame gore sealed his place in the playoffs with a runnerup showing at the regularseason finale in greensboro , nc he finished four strokes ahead of kaymer en route to his second top 10 in 24 starts by failing to qualify for the playoffs , kaymer , who made 13 starts , fell short of the 15event minimum needed to keep his pga tour privileges gore , meanwhile , maintained full playing privileges on the pga tour from one season to the next for the first time since 20089 speaking of kaymer , gore said the guy won the players and the last year , and he s not a tour member \? something s not right i mean , there s loopholes that go the other way with medical and all that good stuff gore acknowledged , i know the tour wants these guys to play more events because it s great , but added , it s a doubleedged sword , unfortunately gore mentioned the ratingsspiking presence in greensboro of tiger woods , who entered the tournament in the hopes of salvaging a lost season by advancing to the playoffs he needed a victory or solo secondplace finish , but woods , one of six former nos 1 in the field , ended up tied for 10th , giving him his lone top10 finish in 11 starts hudson swafford , a pga tour rookie , is ranked 278th , 21 spots behind woods , but he is 100th in the playoff standings , even though he is among more than 20 golfers in the field who did not play a major this season like woods , swafford recorded one top 10 this season , a tie for eighth at the last october during the fall series that is the same fall series that gave a blunt assessment of during a ryder cup news conference in february while applauding the decision to give more weight to dollars earned after the start of 2016 even though the season technically begins in the fall of 2015 if you count money for those last three or four months , mickelson said , you 're giving the bottom half of the tour a threemonth head start over ultimately the top guys the top guys take eight weeks off to recharge , as kaymer did after a 2014 in which he won his second major , helped europe to victory in the ryder cup and made 29 official starts worldwide the time that kaymer took off is comparable to what players on a world serieswinning team end up getting , but no matter the upside of kaymer s losing his pga tour membership is that he will be one of the few top20 players with a more manageable schedule in 201516 with the addition of the olympics to the mix , the coming season , which starts in northern california the week after the presidents cup in south korea in october , is shaping up to be an ultramarathon you 've got to conserve some energy for this run , said davis love iii , 51 , the oldest player in the barclays field and the captain of next year s american ryder cup team it s not the nfl playoffs or the nhl playoffs , where you 're going to get beat up that bad , but you still have to conserve some energy to make it through all four rounds so i can see a guy thinking of skipping one topranked jordan spieth , the leader in the fedex cup points standings , did not consider skipping one , and not just because he has the energy and stamina of a 22yearold i'm happy to be in that position now , but i 'd like to obviously hold it , said spieth , who could lose his no 1 ranking to mcilroy if he plays poorly that s right mcilroy can return to the top spot without swinging a club and go on to win the fedex cup title without gracing all three of the events leading to the tour championship in atlanta in 2012 , mcilroy finished second in the fedex cup playoffs despite grinding out wins in two of the first three playoff events and tying for 10th at the tour championship if spieth does not end up winning the fedex cup race despite the large lead he gained with his season for the ages , it will represent the biggest devaluation of a regular season since the undefeated new england patriots lost to the giants in super bowl xlii for those ranked no 1 or no 125 in these playoffs , one thing seems patently clear doggedness will get you far , but at some point a steel mind is no substitute for fresh legs
seoul , south korea the north korean leader , , said his country had developed a hydrogen bomb , its staterun media said thursday the claim was the latest of several that the isolated country has made about its nuclear capabilities that outside analysts have greeted with skepticism the north s official korean central news agency said mr kim had made the assertion during a visit to the phyongchon revolutionary site , which honors the works of his father and grandfather , who ruled before him his forebears' work turned north korea into a powerful state ready to detonate a selfreliant abomb and hbomb to reliably defend its sovereignty and the dignity of the nation , mr kim was quoted as saying the white house on thursday said it was doubtful that north korea had developed a hydrogen bomb at this point , the information that we have access to calls into serious question those claims , but we take very seriously the risk and the threat that is posed by the north korean regime in their ambitions to develop a nuclear weapon , josh earnest , the white house press secretary , told reporters , according to reuters although the report was the first time mr kim had claimed that the north had developed a hydrogen bomb , several years ago a staterun newspaper asserted that the north may have been trying to build one in may 2010 , the front page of rodong sinmun , north korea s top staterun newspaper , declared that its scientists had succeeded in creating a nuclear fusion reaction , a crucial technology for creating a hydrogen bomb at the time , many observers ridiculed the claim by north korea , which often uses bombastic assertions to increase leverage over its enemies in negotiations or to burnish its image at home but the claim was never completely dismissed hwang jangyop , a former secretary of north korea s ruling workers' party who defected to seoul in 1997 , said the north had long researched nuclear fusion while trying to build a hydrogen bomb , as well as atomic weapons mr hwang  north korea conducted underground tests to set off nuclear devices in 2006 , 2009 and 2013 it has since claimed to have developed diversified and miniaturized nuclear devices , but western experts remain unsure on thursday , south korean officials said that there was no evidence that the north had hydrogen bomb capacity but they also noted that north korea has repeatedly vowed to improve its nuclear arsenal , which is believed to include several weapons , though none as destructive as a hydrogen bomb in a paper published in may , lee chunkeun , a senior researcher at the science and technology policy institute of south korea , said north korea acquired laser nuclear fusion equipment from china in the 1980s and that it a reinforced nuclear weapon from nuclear fusion tests of such an advanced atomic weapon can be done in a lab without an actual nuclear explosion , he wrote further development of nuclear fusion technology would lead to the development of reinforced atomic arms and furthermore hydrogen bomb developments as well making a true hydrogen bomb is very difficult but weapon designers can easily boost the destructive power of an atom bomb by putting at its core a small amount of tritium , a radioactive form of hydrogen in a paper published by the institute for science and international security in washington in september , david albright and serena kellehervergantini said that north korea might be trying to use the only operational reactor at its main nuclear complex in , north of pyongyang , to produce tritium tritium would enable nuclear weapons designs that could have a greater explosive yield than weapons made from only plutonium or weapongrade uranium , they wrote whether north korea can make nuclear weapons using tritium is unknown although we believe that it remains a technical problem north korea still needs to solve
two years into xi jinping s tenure as china s president , many analysts consider him to be the most powerful leader since deng xiaoping , the man who oversaw china s opening to the world and its marketoriented policies after the chaos of the 196676 cultural revolution roderick macfarquhar , a scholar of elite communist party politics at harvard university , goes one step further mr xi , he says , is the most powerful chinese leader since chairman mao zedong , the great helmsman who declared the founding of the people s republic in 1949 and was worshiped almost as a god by millions of fanatical red guards yet for all of mr xi s personal power , his campaign against corruption is fraught with danger , putting at risk the future of the communist party he is determined to save , professor macfarquhar said in a recent talk at the university of hong kong in an interview , he explained why why do you think mr xi is the most powerful leader since mao , given that deng xiaoping had so much charisma and institutional power and experience from his revolutionary days \? deng had enormous power , of course , but surviving the cultural revolution with him were some very conservative leaders , one of whom was his senior in the party , chen yun and li xiannian , peng zhen , all very conservative that s why the 1980s , when deng was in his prime , are often described as opening and closing , opening and closing , because he had to ride the punch sometimes the conservatives forced him to close in and then he opened up again because he could see that it was bad for the economy so he had people of equal status who had the ability , especially after the 1989 suppression of protests at tiananmen , to impress upon him the dangers of what he was doing in the case of xi jinping , he has this unique aspect that he was chosen by his elders and peers and none of his colleagues were in other words , they were all open to be chosen he got chosen that gives him the kind of prestige that mao had in 1936 , when he started his rise to power after all the others , the late prime minister zhou enlai and others , now forgotten , had their chance of leadership and failed so i think that xi jinping is more powerful than deng because he doesn t have people of equal status who are able to challenge him because of their past record he won out in the lottery for the leadership mr xi was a child of the cultural revolution how do you think that might have influenced him \? a former student of mine who went through the cultural revolution has been quite high on what that means for xi , in the sense that he thinks that , if you re in the cauldron , if you have been thrown out of your family house and left to fend for yourself , you develop a selfconfidence if you survive if you can get through that , you can get through a lot more i think he has got that selfconfidence he s also got the selfconfidence of a princeling , of his family being revolutionary leaders not the very top , but revolutionary leaders that invests him in the revolution he wants to preserve it indeed , many people would say that the reason why he was chosen was because he had more invested in the revolution than some of his cohort of leaders so i think for both those reasons he is very selfconfident the others \? you don t get to the top of the politburo standing committee of china without having enormous talents of some kind political talents , administrative talents , infighting talents you can t write them off but xi beat them to the top , and that s his strength you said in your speech that mikhail s gorbachev was also a strong leader what s the difference between him and mr xi \? let me stress the similarities they both wanted to save the communist party because they both believed in communism i think probably gorbachev really believed in marxismleninism i don t think xi jinping probably believes in marxism , only in leninism i think that the cultural revolution was a disillusioning experience for people from deng xiaoping downwards the similarities are that both gorbachev in his attack in perestroika on the bureaucracy and xi jinping in his attack on the bureaucracy in anticorruption were trying to improve the party , purify the party , get it moving in a different direction the difference between them is that xi jinping knows what gorbachev did xi jinping has obsessed about gorbachev very early in his leadership , he was talking to his colleagues about gorbachev , saying , no one stood up to defend the party so , clearly , xi feels he is going to be tough , stand up to defend the party , eradicate corruption and recover the legitimacy of the party in the eyes of the people are there any examples in history where a communist party without ideology can sustain itself \? there is no example because leninist parties have only been around basically since the 1917 revolution in russia so there is no experience of this the party in cuba survived , i suppose , really because the opposition of the united states gave a certain national pride to the cubans , especially when they were able to rely on the soviet union for economic support the north koreans , of course , survived because the chinese are not prepared to cut them off , even though they hate the way they conduct themselves , because they don t want another communist regime to go down the tubes i don t think there is any other experience , and my own feeling is that this party cannot reform itself the choices for xi jinping are , one , ease off the corruption campaign in order to allow the economic reform program , which he s talked about but which hasn t got going , to proceed , because the economic reform may help to save the party in power but if he is going to attack corruption root and branch , tigers and fleas as he would call it , then there is real danger danger for the party collapsing as it did in russia , or danger of a leadership coalition against him is it conceivable that there could be an opposition to xi , a pushback \? no one was prepared in mao s time to ally against him and mao could also rely on the fact that probably if zhou enlai confided in the late president liu shaoqi and said the chairman is going off his rocker , we shouldn t allow this cultural revolution to continue , the chairman could rely on the possibility probability that liu shaoqi would come and report zhou enlai to him , and then dispose of zhou enlai that , i don t think , applies now people aren t frightened of xi jinping in the way they were frightened of mao people s interests , people s families , people s livelihoods are threatened comrades x , y and z can ally together against xi jinping he s not yet a figure that so terrifies his colleagues that they couldn t dream of suggesting to a comrade , let s ally against him , because they don t know that that comrade would not report him is the real danger to the party western values , a free press and a civil society \? how seriously does mr xi take that threat \? how does it compare to corruption as a threat \? there is an internal threat corruption there is an external threat bad ideas from the west he takes both seriously his problem is that , with the internal threat , he can take the discipline inspection commission , a very powerful weapon , backed by the whole apparatus of the central committee , the secretariat , and he can home in on what he wants to home in on the problem for the external threat of foreign ideas is that , as part of the whole process of opening up and reform , deng xiaoping and his successors have allowed hundreds of thousands of students to go abroad , and once china began to be rich , they all started to come back instead of staying wherever they went to study and so you ve got now tens of thousands of former students from america , europe , japan , who are back in their own country , and they ve seen a different future if they re comfortably off , if they work for the party , that may be enough they can say , ok , free press , it was fine when i was in new york , but doesn t matter here , i m all right but i think the danger is that if people feel that the corruption campaign is going to undermine the party and chaos could result that s what happened in the cultural revolution then people are going to start thinking , how can we change this system \? some will emigrate some have already emigrated certainly billions of dollars have emigrated children have been left abroad as a safety belt to hang on to and it s just a case of will people start thinking about alternative methods \? of course , it being a leninist party and leadership friendly , someone at the very top has got to have those ideas , that there s got to be change and that s , frankly , a very difficult thing to envisage deng xiaoping could do it , though he was at the very top , simply because the cultural revolution was such chaos , that you had to have something new we don t know at what stage of the campaign against corruption , the campaign on closing in of ideas from abroad , which could harm the economy , of course , at what stage someone inside china will say this is not going to work we ve got to change a successful campaign against corruption and closing off to western ideas are related then \? you say a successful campaign against corruption but the point about a successful campaign against corruption is that it s all very well to get a few tigers , have cheers from the multitude because you ve brought these people down but it s the fleas who are the real danger the peasants and the workers are afflicted by local cadres petty corruption some of which results in ecological damage to the neighborhood and therefore health problems for themselves and their kids those are the people that are really the threat to the population at large , and if he goes after them , who s going to work for the party \? who s going to be the new cadres \? a party without ideology is that a sustainable model \? without an ideology , you lack the glue that the confucian empire had , you lack the glue that the maoist period had and so you have nothing in common between party and people , between state and country and that s a very difficult thing to proceed with in china when you have a leninist party that by its very definition , when it was first formed in the late 19th century , relies upon ideology to convince people that we understand the history , we understand the present and we know where to go in the future that s a very powerful doctrine , if you believe in it without any such doctrine , he has coursed to this very negative policy of trying to keepouttheenemy doctrine it s much better if you re closed in the armor of your own doctrine than if you just have the old apparatus of the great firewall in order to keep out the enemy doctrine does china rely more on nationalism then \? doesn t that risk fascism \? i m not sure about fascism but i am sure that nationalism is one of the reasons why the foreign policy of xi jinping has been somewhat provocative perhaps in the east china sea , south china sea , vis vis america , as a device to get people behind him in his campaigns , particularly the corruption campaign but i think that in the long run that s a very dangerous path to pursue because as chinese governments in the past have found , if you unleash nationalism and then you are unwilling or unable to follow through with the right actions , then the people get fed up with you , they think that you are being unpatriotic yourself , that the government is failing and so nationalism is a very dangerous thing to unleash i don t think it is fascism so much i just think it is just a weapon for xi jinping if you don t have confucianism or marxism , and you aren t focusing on nationalism , what do you have \? nothing that s why xi jinping is so worried what is interesting about what he is trying to do is he has had a campaign , which i didn t quite understand at first , to say that the whole of the communist regime is one united period of history and he s argued against what apparently happens in china , that you divide it into two periods the maoist period , which basically had those great tragedies , the famine and the cultural revolution , and the reform period , which basically has been a move towards a better , brighter , more prosperous future because he realizes , he says in his attacks on gorbachev and what happened in the soviet union , one of the problems was that they attacked lenin and stalin , and that led to an undermining of the whole system and he realizes that , if you start allowing the first 20 years , 25 years or so , of mao s rule to be denigrated for all the mistakes that happened , then you are going to delegitimize mao and as the picture of mao s face on the tiananmen gate shows , mao is still the great legitimator of this regime that s all they ve got left they ve got no marxismleninism , they ve got no party that s got respect and authority any longer people are revolting against local cadres 500 times every day , apparently , in china they have mao how long that will last \? how much he means to the young people today \? i don t know
re putin sows divisions in eu to fight sanctions \( news , april 8 \) the use of such terms as turkey s military occupation and turkish invasion is problematic and divisive , just as we are trying , yet again , to pursue a settlement moreover , they remain factually incorrect and reflect neither the legal nor the historical reality of the island none of the united nations security council resolutions on cyprus describe the legitimate and justified turkish intervention of 1974 , undertaken in accordance with the treaty of guarantee of 1960 , as invasion and its subsequent presence in the island as occupation as the article notes , the west is aware of the close relationship between russia and the greek cypriot administration , supposedly a committed member state of the european union yet it is astonishing that the greek cypriot side pursues such policies with impunity , enjoying the recognition and political support of the west while the turkish cypriot people remain isolated from the world , contrary to numerous decisions of the united nations , the council of the european union and the council of europe the strong ties between greek cypriot and russian political leaders are a matter of concern for the united states and the european union they are also a matter of concern for the turkish cypriots who live on the island under embargoes and restrictions we have a right to be heard , and it is the responsibility and duty of the international community to ensure we are not left out in the cold with negotiations due to restart , it is of paramount importance that greek and turkish cypriots are treated equally the writer is the representative of the turkish republic of northern cyprus in new york re nuclear fears in south asia \( editorial , april 7 \) you paint a picture of pakistan as recklessly expanding its nuclear arsenal but pakistan was not the first to introduce nuclear weapons in south asia it was forced to develop a nuclear capability for selfdefense due to its troubled history with india and that country s accumulation of conventional and strategic capabilities nevertheless , pakistan has consistently declared that its nuclear weapons are for deterrence , not war pakistan has no desire to engage in a conventional or nuclear arms race in south asia similarly , the editorial s warnings about socalled internal turmoil in pakistan are off the mark pakistan continues to deal effectively with the menace of terrorism on the economy , only a glance at the international monetary fund s latest review shows that the country is in far better shape than you assert time and again pakistanis have proved their resilience and determination in difficult periods recycling theories about impending economic disaster or terrorists posing a serious threat to the state structure serves no purpose the writer is the press attach of the pakistan embassy re tunisia s hour of need \( opinion , march 28 \) while we agree with mustapha tlili that tunisia s democratic future needs the political and economic support of the west if we are to avoid extremist paths , his criticisms of the ennahdha party are unsubstantiated mr tlili writes that ennahdha , which voluntarily handed over power for the sake of safeguarding tunisia s transition and approving an inclusive progressive constitution , had pushed for theocracy quite the opposite ennahdha has for decades promoted a democratic civil state based on the sovereignty of the people and significantly contributed to the most progressive constitution in the region , recognizing equal rights and liberties and promoting women s rights the writer also claims that tunisia suffered from four years of financial mismanagement by ennahdha tunisia is recovering from decades of mismanagement and corruption , as well as postrevolution instability exacerbated by global recession it is entirely unfair to blame tunisia s difficulties on ennahdha and its partners during their four years in office ennahdha and its allies took major steps to stabilize the economy after its freefall in 2011 , and the party continues to contribute today as part of a government aimed at building a successful , sustainable and inclusive economy the writer is the international spokeswoman for the ennahdha party re as birthrates dip , europe rethinks approach to sex education \( business , april 9 \) it is fascinating that european classrooms have become so open to the topic of sex let s face it , teenagers are sexual beings and yet many schools in the united states still refuse to acknowledge this and stick to an abstinenceonly curriculum if we know that many teenagers are going to engage in sexual activities at some point , why not give them the proper knowledge to do so safely \? when will america s sex education practices catch up with the times we live in \?
florham park , nj it was secondandgoal , and had the ball at the 1yard line lined up to the outside was their hulking new receiver , brandon marshall , who feinted right and then broke inside , beating his defender quarterback geno smith rifled a quick slant , and marshall grabbed the ball in the end zone this scene played out on the jets' practice field thursday they expect to watch it repeated , again and again , in far larger venues this fall of the many reasons the jets traded for marshall in march , perhaps none are greater than his proficiency in the red zone , where marshall , 31 , can best put his talents and bountiful physical gifts size , leaping ability , catching radius to use no team fared worse last season in the red zone that compact area inside the opponent s 20yard line that shrinks passing lanes and demands trust and timing between quarterbacks and receivers than the jets , who managed touchdowns on 362 percent \( 17 of 47 \) of their visits no wide receiver has scored more in the red zone since 2007 than marshall , who has 47 touchdowns in that span , trailing only san diego tight end antonio gates \( 48 \) , according to pro football focus he has a little bit of that alpha demeanor , which you really like , general manager mike maccagnan said there is that marshall s oneonone matchups in training camp with darrelle revis , whom he beat for that 1yard touchdown on thursday , and antonio cromartie have provided terrific theater marshall wants the ball on every play , even when a run is called but there are other reasons marshall ranks among the most skilled redzone performers if there could be another megatron , it would be him , revis said , comparing him to the lions' calvin johnson in the league marshall declined to discuss his techniques or approach , but a survey of several teammates , jets personnel and a former nfl head coach yielded four primary reasons for his effectiveness build at 6 feet 4 inches and 230 pounds , marshall almost always presents a mismatch taller and stronger than most cornerbacks he encounters on the outside , marshall also tends to be faster than the nickels , linebackers or safeties who defend him in the slot when he races past , marshall uses his frame to his advantage , shielding defenders from the ball he jumps at the right time and is strong at the point of the catch , the former nfl coach steve mariucci , now an analyst for nfl network , said in a telephone interview there s an art to it , and he has a knack marshall attracts double coverage , or at least safety help , and his presence is likely to create more oneonone opportunities for eric decker and jeremy kerley hands soon after hearing that the jets had acquired marshall , smith started watching game film of him smith noticed that marshall almost never seemed to catch the ball with his body instead , marshall plucks it out of the air with his hands , the same strong hands that help him avoid jams at the line of scrimmage his sessions at the jugs machine , in which he stands about 10 yards away and grabs passes onehanded , have become a staple of camp you trust a guy like that , smith said you can locate the ball because you know that he s going to have his hands there if you want to throw it behind , you can put it there because he 'll stick his hands out and grab it if you put it out front , it s hard for defensive backs to reach around and swipe the ball route running for a tall receiver , marshall is considered a strong route runner not just a strider , mariucci said with a versatile repertoire he can run screens , fades , slants and backshoulder routes as efficiently as smaller passcatchers he comes in and out of his breaks well and has the shortarea quickness that is so valuable when trying to create separation in the red zone as a whole , not just the end zone he s a lot faster than you think he is , said coach todd bowles , who was on the dolphins' staff when marshall spent two seasons with miami attention to detail when discussing redzone matters with teammates , marshall demands precision and perfection marshall , the secondyear receiver shaq evans said , runs his routes at the exact depth expected , dipping his shoulders upon release to give the defensive back less space to impede him at the line of scrimmage when running a flag route , marshall zips toward the back pylon when running a scissors route , marshall dashes toward the front pylon if marshall stops his route even a foot too soon or too late , that could affect other receivers and compromise spacing everything s quicker , everything s faster , everything s tighter , so you have to make the details very important , evans said that s what he always preaches to us in the meeting room when the jets evaluated freeagent receivers this offseason , they noticed how some players , like jeremy maclin , who left philadelphia to sign a fiveyear deal with kansas city worth 225 million guaranteed , amassed a load of yards his 1 , 318 ranked ninth in the league without catching what they considered a commensurate number of touchdowns maclin had 10 what impressed the jets about marshall was how , even as he was slowed by ankle problems and , later , by broken ribs that caused him to miss the bears' final three games , he still had eight touchdowns among his 61 catches averaging a touchdown every 76 receptions , marshall ranked sixth among the 57 receivers who caught at least 50 passes , according to pro football reference to maintain this high level of production with the jets 23 of his 32 redzone catches the last three seasons have been touchdowns marshall must rely on an entity he can only partly control smith a very tall receiver can be a quarterback s very good friend , mariucci said , and so it is the jets' hope last season , smith completed 542 percent \( 26 of 48 \) of his redzone passes , continuing an ignominious tradition among jets quarterbacks the team s 31 passing touchdowns since 2012 tie the jaguars for fewest in the league , and its 11 scores , on 73 attempts , produced a success rate \( 151 percent \) ahead of only jacksonville , according to research by pro football focus the day the jets acquired marshall , smith started thinking about his effect in the red zone less than a week later , he flew to florida to train with marshall and begin forming a connection that takes years to build marshall has a history of friction with his quarterbacks , but four months in , his relationship with smith is strong at practice , they often walk toward the sideline together , debriefing each other how was their timing \? why did that play work \? why did they not complete the pass \? every day , smith learns something new about marshall , he said but this he figured out the first day he worked with him on redzone concepts i do n't think there s ever a bad time to throw it to him
kotzebue , alaska in this native village situated on a gravel spit above the arctic circle , life is changing more quickly than the alaskans who have lived off the land and water here for thousands of years can keep pace with the ice is the biggest thing , said dominic ivanoff , 28 , a leader of kotzebue s tribal council he used to need two footlong auger extensions to cut holes through the thick ice when he went fishing in april now , he said , the ice is thin enough that he needs none the situation is even more severe in smaller villages surrounding this remote slice of northwest alaska , where is not a political talking point or a theoretical scientific phenomenon but a punishing everyday reality some communities are sinking into the water , as erosion and melting permafrost wash away their foundations it was here that arrived on wednesday to deliver his alarmsounding message about the warming of the planet a phenomenon occurring twice as quickly in alaska as in the rest of the united states bringing with him promises of new aid for arctic communities whose shorelines and infrastructure are crumbling because of rising temperatures in a historymaking stop the first presidential visit to arctic alaska mr obama delivered a speech laying out new federal efforts to help these communities cope with coastal erosion and high energy costs and , in some extreme cases , relocate altogether coming at the end of a trip he used to and to rally support in the united states and globally to address it , the announcement of the new efforts was a bid to draw attention to places that are feeling the effects most acutely if your people are in a dire situation , if you allow whole communities to no longer exist , that reflects you as a leader , said diane ramoth of sewalik , an inland village of 900 people that has been trying for 10 years to relocate to higher ground but has struggled to find the money to do it our village is going to be under water on the mostly gravel and dirt streets of this town surrounded by water , where caribou and moose antlers adorn wooden houses on pilings and where pickup trucks and allterrain vehicles are the mode of transportation of choice , residents said they were grateful for the focus mr obama was putting on their difficulties , and for the new promises of federal support townspeople flocked under a gray sky to a gymnasium here to see mr obama , many of them wearing brightly colored traditional inuit parkas known as atigluks if there becomes , as a result of all of this , a focal point where communities that are really facing the brunt of this crisis can go to get their issues addressed or get answers or make their case , that would be the best that could come of this , said reggie joule , the mayor of the northwest arctic borough it means that america has chosen to engage in a way that can help our people , and we have a president at the helm saying that these are important issues but there is also a hefty dose of skepticism from a native population that has often felt ignored , marginalized and victimized by the federal and state governments , and a sense that mr obama s efforts do not come close to meeting their urgent needs the president announced that the denali commission , the federal agency that coordinates government assistance to communities in alaska , would oversee short and longterm programs to safeguard and repair the coastal villages , and was committing 2 million to such initiatives , including voluntary relocation efforts , where appropriate what is 2 million going to give us \? ms ramoth said with a rueful smile a dream \? at the borough hall on third avenue , not far from the sea wall built three years ago to cope with storm surges made worse by a rising sea , tribal leaders said climate change was affecting every aspect of their lives , fulfilling ageold prophecies of the transformations that would follow the arrival of white people in alaska that maniilaq prophecy said things would change , and now we 're seeing the change to climate , said merle custer of shungnak , referring to an inupiat healer and prophet who is said to have predicted in the 19th century , before europeans arrived in arctic alaska , that white people would come and transform the world , bringing boats that were powered by fire or flew in the air it s changing fast earlier , in dillingham , where mr obama visited with fishermen and clapped along and joined in as schoolchildren dressed in native attire performed yup'ik dances , he spoke of the importance of preserving ancient traditions and livelihoods it represents not just a critical way of life that has to be preserved , but it also represents one of the most important natural resources that the united states has , mr obama said of subsistence salmon fishing in bristol bay this is one of the reasons why we have shut off and gas exploration in this region it is too fragile , and it is too important but in kotzebue , where bearded seals bobbed their heads above the water and dived for fish in the bay , the issue of energy exploration is less clear cut oil and gas drilling is an important economic driver royal dutch shell has parked equipment nearby and situated some staff members in the village , and mr obama s recent decision to a few hundred miles north in the chukchi sea is popular it s a doubleedged sword for us , because we know that the industry does help to create climate change , but we understand that it s going to do that anyway , and if it has to happen , we want our people to benefit from that development , said maija lukin , the mayor of kotzebue mr obama briefly diverted on its way to kotzebue to fly over the isolated barrier island of kivalina , which is increasingly at risk of being wiped out by erosion and storm surges if another country threatened to wipe out an american town , we 'd do everything in our power to protect it , mr obama told a crowd in kotzebue that greeted him with seal barks , a traditional native alaskan cheer well , climate change poses the same threat right now he was introduced by millie hawley , a tribal leader from kivalina , who put the matter in stark terms , saying the eightmile island she calls home may soon be underwater my current home may not exist 10 years from now , she said

update , nov 4 carl zimmer has filed a fresh update from the scientists investigating the mass dieoff of saiga populations they see signs of weather conditions triggering a toxic change in normally harmless bacteria the numbers and images that describe a mass dying of the critically endangered saiga , the world s northernmost antelope species , on the grassy steppe in the betpakdala region of kazakhstan are stunning hastily bulldozed pits brim with corpses the count of dead animals , according to the united nations environment program , is more than 120 , 000 out of the 250 , 000 alive in the most recent survey below , you can read why i see good odds that this ecocataclysm was caused by a communal binge on noxious weeds that thrive in the region in warm , wet springs \( it has been wet there the closest city to the area where the dieoff occurred , astana , reported that a month s worth of rain fell on a single day , may 16 \) a n update from the field , appended below , indicates odds of a dietary cause are dropping  the enormous new saiga dieoff is particularly devastating to conservation biologists because efforts to cut poaching \( for meat and medicinal horns \) were gaining steam in recent years \( visit the websites of the saiga conservation alliance and wildlife conservation society for more \) the ancient species had numbered more than a million a century ago and in a crash similar to that of the american bison in the 19th century was reduced to a few tens of thousands of animals at its nadir that crash has been blamed on booming meat demand after the fall of the soviet union , but some research points to subtler issues in 2009 , the saiga conservationist elena bykova described the 1990s crash as the fastest decline ever recorded for a mammal species  over the past week , speculation on the cause has focused on various diseases , including ailments related to bacteria found in some specimens by an international team that has raced to the region this excerpt from the un news release , though , stresses that those pathogens are not triggers i t is becoming clear that two secondary opportunistic pathogens , specifically pasteurella and clostridia , are contributing to the rapid and widespread dieoff however , the hunt for the fundamental drivers of the mass mortality continues since these bacteria are only lethal to an animal if its immune system is already weakened andy coghlan has written an excellent overview for new scientist , including this reaction from richard kock , a scientist from the royal veterinary college in hatfield , england , who has done extensive research on the species it s very dramatic and traumatic , with 100percent mortality i know of no example in history with this level of mortality , killing all the animals and all the calves postscript has more updates from kock  carl zimmer has filed a news story for the times with additional context  friday morning , i began sifting the literature on saiga mortality and found strong hints of a possible cause in a study of smaller saiga dieoffs in 2010 \( 12 , 000 animals \) and 2011 \( just 450 \) in the animal s westernmost population , in the urals the paper has a ponderous title examination of the forage basis of saiga in the ural population on the background of the mass death in may 2010 and 2011 \( if you read russian , please provide the journal name ! \) but it s full of fascinating relevant information the first thing that struck me was the similarity in timing those events and this year s mass dying were in mid to late may the reported symptoms in the dead and dying animals are the same , as well foaming at the mouth , diarrhea and bloating the paper on the urals deaths also notes that well before the 2010 and 2011 events , there had been previous dieoffs including in 1955 , 1956 , 1958 , 1967 , 1969 , 1974 , 1981 and 1988 by email , i reached til dieterich , one of the authors of the paper on the uralregion dyings he said as with an airplane crash , there is not only one cause behind this and it is not unprecedented in 1988 there was a mass death with 434 , 000 animals dead \( 68 percent of the population \) more or less in the same region for more detail , read the abstract from his paper , cowritten with bibigul sarsenova mass death of saiga antelopes took place from 18 to 21 may 2010 in the north west of west kazakhstan province northeast and southeast of borsy \( about 12000 dead animals found \) in august and september the forage basis of saiga antelope in the mass death area was investigated mass growth of potentially poisonous brassicacea species for ruminants could be found on abandoned fields in the area \( lepidium perfoliatum , lepidium ruderale , descurainia sophia and thlaspi arvense \) due to favorable warm and wet weather conditions in spring 2010 the mass growth of these annual brassicacea species occurred on a big scale even though saiga is capable to eat large amount of this plants , they are poisonous to ruminants when consumed in large amounts in addition lush growth of brassicacea and poacea species \( poa bulbosa , eremophyrum triticeum , leymus ramosus , elytrigia repens \) providing high protein forage , can cause the observed symptoms of foamy fermentation , diarrhea and bloating the animals thus could have been killed by extreme bloating and or acute pulmonary edema \( fog fever \) after foraging on wet and highly nutritious fog pastures qualitative investigations in the field confirmed that the animals ate most abovementioned species in addition the animals have been congregating for calving , which does contribute to a higher background stress the results of the investigation suggest that a combination of at least some of the above listed factors is responsible for the tragic events here s the paper s concluding section in both years the saiga death events started just after the females and their 1 2 week old young started to move again during the first 10 days of the calving time the females did not leave their young and not even move to the nearby water places for drinking in both cases the calving sites where some meters higher and covered either by mainly steppe vegetation \( 2010 , stipafestuca steppe \) or leymus ramosus grassland on fallow fields thus the moist pastures where presumably more intensively used during the death event nevertheless the heavy rain events just before or during the death event , did certainly lead to very moist fodder especially in the morning hours in 2010 even fog was reported by the locals just before the dying started the local people also reported , that lepidium species do cause diarrhea in cattle and after heavy rain events herders do not let their livestock out to the pastures before noon wet and warm weather conditions have also been reported for the betbak dala population during the spring death events in 1981 and 1988 the animals have also been calving for the first time in the borsy area usually using pastures further south in the semi desert region part of the saiga population did actually calve further south in the semidesert area 2011 and no deaths were reported here wet weather conditions in spring combined with lush pastures are thus obviously problematic to saiga the paper includes recommendations to limit risks of such events going forward with this evidence on hand we recommend in similar wet years to keep saiga off such dangerous pastures and train the responsible rangers in identifying the described dangerous conditions if it turns out difficult or dangerous for the saiga population to keep them off dangerous pastures , the relevant areas should just be cut during the time when the animals are immobile during the first 10 days of calving cutting the dangerous pastures will prevent excessive development of toxins and protein in the plants even if the plants are eaten dry the risk of negative effects is minimized the authors warn against expanding agriculture in saiga territory , noting that plowing or herbicide use would simply lead to mass growth of the weedy toxic species in the cleared area this will enlarge the risk of pasture problems even more , they wrote there ll be much more to report in the coming days richard kock sent this cautionary note by email , stressing that weeks of analysis will be required to nail down what happened we just need to try to gather all the evidence we can from the animals and the environment in the end this will guide us to the pathogenesis of this problem until then much of what you will read is speculation we have a pretty good idea of the proximate cause of death but less understanding of possible triggers but noxious weeks i doubt , as the steppe was looking pretty good over this die off and the animals are highly selective so not likely to make mistakes on diet rich grass might upset the stomach and rain and warmth can promote this so perhaps a factor but we will need a lot of work to prove this hopefully it will be done a new update from kock cuts against a dietary cause it is dose that matters and no evidence any single plant was in abundance in the rumen other than grasses the ingestion of nutrient dense grasses might have led to some ruminal disorder and subsequent tympany and toxicosis the animals in these outbreaks were eating mainly wheat grass from my limited examination of grazed plants and a few more of their normal food plants no evidence for pure plant toxicity remember they are highly selective feeders ! but pasture analysis would help including toxicology to rule this out and also looking at other potential toxic factors perhaps in water although plenty of this around this year i doubt algal toxicosis as a trigger but all this should be ruled out kock , in an interview with the bbc , has pointed more toward environmental conditions as a trigger , and stressed that dieoffs are not unprecedented what we re seeing is sort of a perfect storm of different factors , prof kock explained two different bacteria , pasteurelosis and clostridia , have been found in every dead animal studied these bacteria are naturally found in the animals respiratory and gut systems , so something must have reduced the immunity of the animals one possible trigger is climatic this year a very cold winter was followed by a wet spring , and this may have affected the immune competence of the animals , making them more vulnerable to the bacteria this , or some other trigger , pushed the animals past a threshold at which the bacteria overcame saiga immune defenses and became deadly enough to transmit to their calves there s no infectious disease that can work like this , said prof kock he added that the wave of saiga deaths was not unprecedented this dieoff syndrome has occurred on a number of occasions in 1984 , 2010 and 2012 there were massive dieoffs , but none of these claimed such a massive proportion of the population despite these huge losses , saiga antelope are surprisingly well adapted to recover quickly from population crashes its strategy for survival is based on a high reproductive rate , so the saiga produce triplets and have the highest fetal biomass of any mammal it s built , in a sense , to recover from collapse , prof kock said  the saiga conservation alliance has set up to help support analysis of the dieoff and steps to protect the species
beirut , lebanon the syrian army soldier had long served in palmyra , but he was on leave when he heard that islamic state militants had attacked a village northeast of the desert city , killing dozens of his comrades he sent frantic text messages , trying to reach them no one answered he shared his anguish last week in a series of texts as he slowly pieced together bits of the story from survivors of the massacre soldiers told him they had run out of ammunition one officer radioed to headquarters , we 're finished worst of all , the soldier said , was the photograph he was shown of the decapitated body of a friend , the 19yearold daughter of a syrian general within a matter of days this week , the islamic state , also called or isil , seized with apparent ease the cities of ramadi in and palmyra in , in both cases seemingly coming out of nowhere to rout government forces on thursday , the militants were digging in , consolidating their grip and executing people with ties to the old order yet a closer look at the two battles shows the group following a longerterm strategy , in both cases biding its time , taking territory mainly from other insurgent groups then , after years of war , attrition and corruption had left the government forces demoralized and , particularly in , hollowed out , it attacked , overrunning them palmyra was a place where tensions had long simmered , a mainly sunni tribal city where a local rebellion was put down early in the war , and where relations between residents and security forces were complex a young officer serving there from the alawite heartland had confessed a year earlier that he felt no connection to the population and feared residents would kill him the first chance they had ramadi , the capital of anbar province , iraq s sunni heartland , was also divided in its loyalties those problems were on display in palmyra before and during wednesday s rout residents were caught between the latest islamic state onslaught and what sometimes seemed like a haphazard government response the scenes of chaos that unfolded belied the syrian state news media s claim that government forces had withdrawn only after taking families to safety residents supporters and opponents of president bashar alassad described officers fleeing , leaving civilians and lowly conscript soldiers to fend for themselves one business owner said he watched progovernment militiamen run helterskelter into orchards , not sure where to retreat treason , he called it residents videotaped airstrikes coming close to the town s medieval citadel and wondered why the militants had not been bombed earlier by the government or , for that matter , by the united statesled coalition waging a parallel air war against them while they were traversing miles of open desert roads but most of all , they said , they had lost any sense that the government could provide safety even to its loyalists on thursday , after the militants had taken over the city and begun executing people they deemed close to the government , many residents cowered in their houses and basements , terrified of militants in the streets and of government shelling and airstrikes from the sky some found it ominous that the state news media had incorrectly declared that most civilians had been evacuated , perhaps an excuse to increase airstrikes i can foresee the regime bombarding the town massively , especially after the huge loss among its soldiers , said khaled alhomsi , a member of the committee that organized antigovernment protests in palmyra in 2011 , before anyone imagined fullblown civil war , let alone a group like the islamic state the civilians are terrified , he said the only bakery is controlled by the army is bombing randomly mr homsi , 32 , a former hotel worker who uses a nom de guerre for safety , said he was nervous that the militants would seek revenge against him and other activists who oppose them and the government i'm happy that palmyra was liberated from the regime , but not happy it fell under daesh control , he said , using the arabic acronym for the islamic state in my view , as an activist , it is not a liberation in a rare wartime visit to palmyra a year ago , new york times reporters met a range of people , who have kept in touch in recent days , they provided a playbyplay view of the chaos , emotion and uncertainty there as the militants rolled in khalil alhariri , an archaeologist who keeps his hair dyed shoepolish black , fled his house on the northern edge of the city , which had become the front line , while his colleagues scurried to cart away ancient artifacts from the museum on palmyra s few shopping streets , metal gates rolled down , shuttering businesses like the zenobia caf , named for a legendary queen of ancient palmyra omar , a fellow activist of mr homsi s , began erasing computer files that he thought the militants would find incriminating mr homsi said he had nothing to hide poking fun at the islamic state s ban on smoking , he said , i 'll hide my cigarettes ahmed , who owns an antiquities shop near the museum , said on wednesday that his family had packed their bags to leave town but , he said , the government is not allowing us expecting to head to palmyra with reinforcements , the soldier , who is 27 and comes from a sunni family , sent a photograph maybe his last , he warned but the roads were blocked a cousin serving in palmyra told him stay where you are god loves you the soldier asked not to be further identified out of fears for the safety of he and his family after the militants took control , mr hariri , the archaeologist , reached again by phone , said that he had left with about four people nevertheless , he said , most of the civilians are still there he paused what can i say \? the situation is really bad another business owner spluttered in anger , this is the army s fault he was out of town when the assault came , but was unable to get his parents out he said his parents had reported militants' issuing a call from the minarets for people to hand over any soldiers or government workers yet , at the same time , the militants were fanning out through the city to offer services they are even handing out bread , god forbid , he said by thursday night , several dozen people had been publicly executed , residents said for mr homsi , the day s events had presented him with a new power to revolt against we will face and confront the destruction of the town s history and heritage , he said the revolution was and will remain my life we wo n't accept oppression from anyone as for the soldier , he had lived through bloody battles , but none had shaken him like the deaths of his comrades \( thirtyfive soldiers were buried in the provincial capital of homs on thursday alone , a resident who lives near the hospital there said \) i wish i were not a soldier , but a civilian living normal life , married with children , he confessed on wednesday his situation , he said , reminded him of a line from the beloved damascene poet nizar qabbani love me away from the lands of oppression and repression , away from our city which has had its fill of death then he headed off to try once more to reach the front he has not texted since
yasar kemal , the master storyteller who repeatedly clashed with the turkish state while emerging as his country s first novelist of global stature , died on saturday in istanbul , according to s staterun news agency , anadolu his age was uncertain , because no one kept records in the isolated village where he grew up , but he was born in 1922 or 1923 anadolu reported his age as 92 , but other news agencies said he was 91 mr kemal s home region cukurova in southern anatolia , known in antiquity as cilicia is the backdrop for his sweeping tales of rapacious landlords , callous bureaucrats and peasant heroes who fight injustice he wrote more than two dozen books , using a colorful narrative style that appealed to a broad audience , fiercely criticizing injustice and creating noble outlaws who became permanent parts of turkey s cultural landscape his bestknown hero was slim memed , who appeared in his most famous book , memed , my hawk , and in a sequel , they burn the thistles slim memed takes up the cause of his oppressed neighbors , flees to the hills and leads soldiers on wildgoose chases as local people feed , shelter and encourage him as an outspoken advocate of kurdish rights and a sharp critic of his country s leaders , mr kemal was often in trouble with the law during the 1980s and '90s , when he was considered a leading candidate for the in literature , newspapers and government leaders denounced the swedish academy for failing to choose him , asserting that it was motivated by antiturkish prejudice that same establishment , however , hauled him into court several times for his outspoken views some nationalists called him a traitor none of this intimidated him , any more than his peasant heroes were intimidated by the aghas , the feudal lords who brutalized and exploited them for a writer , he once explained , looking over your shoulder is suicide kemal sadik gokceli was born into a turkishkurdish family in the village of hemite \( now gokcedam \) in southern turkey by his own account , few of his male ancestors died in bed his uncle mahiro , he said , was the most famous outlaw in eastern anatolia , iran and the caucasus when he was 5 years old , he saw his father murdered , which left him with a severe stutter for years he began composing and reciting his own poems at the age of 8 after working as a cotton picker , tractor driver and threshing machine operator , he took a job at the library in adana there were few patrons , and he spent his time devouring world literature , especially the works of stendhal , cervantes and chekhov , whom he called my master if i had not discovered literature , he later mused , i would have become a bard , a singer of epic poems in 1951 , he went to istanbul and began more than a decade of work at the prestigious newspaper cumhuriyet wishing to escape the notoriety of his youth he had discovered marxism in adana and been imprisoned for several months on charges of spreading communist ideas he adopted a pen name , yasar kemal in 1962 , he joined the leftish turkish workers party , and he served as one of its leaders until quitting after the soviet invasion of czechoslovakia in 1968 although his books focus on the hard lives of peasants and the valor of rebels who spring up among them , his work is also notable for its focus on environmental destruction the burning of forests , the draining of swamps and the slaughter of dolphins are among the evils he portrays as ruinous results of greed as a young journalist , mr kemal played a key role in stopping the planned destruction of a historic armenian shrine , the holy cross church on akhtamar island in eastern turkey armenians are sympathetic characters in several of his novels in 2013 , the armenian ministry of culture gave him its krikor naregatsi decoration to recognize his tribute to armenian cultural heritage and his courage , as well as his commitment to universal values related to justice , freedom and human dignity if mr kemal had a stylistic comrade , it was turkey s greatest poet , nazim hikmet , who was also a communist and died in moscow in 1963 after being chased from his homeland both men rejected the heavy , formalized language of ottoman literature and instead wrote vivid narratives infused with traditional stories , myths , proverbs and colloquialisms in 1996 , after asserting in the german magazine der spiegel that kurds had a right to break away from turkey , and following that with an article in the london journal index on censorship denouncing the racist , oppressive regime that crushed all the people of anatolia like a steamroller , he was tried and given a suspended sentence of 20 months in prison for inciting hatred mr kemal lived long enough to see his government move toward democracy and change its approach to its kurdish population in his later years , he was showered with honors , including the presidential cultural and artistic grand prize , turkey s highest cultural award , in 2008 by that time , his global reputation was assured , but a younger generation of turkish writers , many of them modernists who emerged from the urban elite rather than the peasantry , was eclipsing him when orhan pamuk , the most prominent of them , won the nobel prize in 2006 , mr kemal s chances evaporated yet these novelists acknowledged their debt to him he is one of the few writers who can deftly blend the compassion and love he feels for his characters with astute irony , morbid criticism and sharp social observations , said one of them , elif shafak in each and every book , he touches and lifts up the beauty of becoming a free , soulsearching human individual , even in the most feudal social settings he is the architect of unforgettable literary heroes and a beacon for writers of the generations that followed him mr kemal married thilda serrero , who came from one of istanbul s leading jewish families , in 1952 , and before her death in 2001 , she translated many of his books into english , including wind from the plain trilogy , published as a boxed set in june 2011 by yale university press in 2002 , he married ayse semiha baban she survives him , as does an adopted son , rait gokceli in they burn the thistles , a villager who shelters the outlaw hero , slim memed , gazes at him as he sleeps and describes him in terms that might apply to the novelist himself in that man there s a brave heart , a good brain , and great humanity , he tells his wife he s so bighearted that both the aghas and the government are afraid of him terrified of him there were 500 bandits in the mountains , but that did n't bother the government why not \? because they were not generous , bighearted men
they brought and noah syndergaard to the interview room and sat them side by side in an unwitting reminder of how far these have come in an everchanging narrative of 2015 with the now two victories from the world series , the sight of syndergaard and wright in the aftermath of another declarative statement against one of baseball s elite pitchers harked back to early march in port st lucie , fla remember the spring training dispatch about how to his then 22yearold heart s content during an intrasquad game \? if there is a young player that is here , there is a reason they have talent and potential , wright said that day after a chat with syndergaard about where a young pitcher , ticketed to begin the season in the minors , belonged at that moment on the bench with the other wannabes i would encourage them to use this chance to take every opportunity to learn from it what we glean from the mets with thrilling regularity night after postseason night is that the onceentrenched sense of fatalism at citi field is increasingly futile , obscured or even overwhelmed by talent , potential and the opportunity created from the apparent realization that their time may really , truly be now wright s runscoring and slumpeviscerating double to deep center field off jake arrieta drove in the first of three firstinning runs , which were all syndergaard and the mets' bullpen needed to subdue the cubs in and take a twogamestonone lead in the national league championship series heading home to wrigley field , the cubs may need to sweep the three games in chicago to have a chance i 'd like 15 degrees more fahrenheit , might help a little bit , cubs manager joe maddon said yes , the temperature is supposed be better at wrigley and no , it was not ideal hitters' weather sunday night , when the game , of course , had to be played so those clever baseball marketers could match their premier series against an nfl reunion of tom brady and the indianapolis colts but if a team from chicago found it a little too blustery to hit in new york , maddon s young men may be suffering more from a deflated ego than the potential handstinging treacheries of october after punched a single into right field through the infield shift leading off the home first against arrieta \( regularseason earned run average 177 \) , wright crushed a ball to center in the swirling wind beyond dexter fowler , scoring granderson that brought up daniel murphy in a scene that seemed lifted straight from the the natural on an early swing on a breaking ball down , murphy , with an exaggerated followthrough , stroked a long fly that drifted to the wrong side of the rightfield foul pole , evoking many thoughts of hah , hah , he almost did it again a couple of pitches later , murphy did it again , his fifth home run of the postseason on the happy side of the pole and this from a guy who twice in his career as a mostly everyday player hit six for the entire season it was another breaking ball down , really down he hit it off the ground , granderson said two innings later , granderson now hitting 375 in seven postseason games , with an onbase percentage of 448 reached again leading off , this time with a walk he stole second while wright was striking out , and here came murphy maddon had seen enough of this movie i did n't want to mess with it , he said he had arrieta walk murphy intentionally , playing by the book of leftyrighty percentages , except he was putting another man on base for yoenis cespedes and his 105 regularseason runs batted in ces hit 35 bombs this season i was surprised , said murphy , when asked if maddon s move was more conventional wisdom or the waving of a white flag in his direction cespedes was so mad that he hit a ground ball in the hole for a runscoring single after granderson , who led the mets in stolen bases with all of 11 , took third , a third straight game a mets base runner has swiped that base even as mets fans enjoy this pinchme postseason , simmering beneath the surface are fears that cespedes will soon disappear but with the way murphy is going , are they worried about the wrong prospective free agent \? after nearly a decade of misery , who can blame them for thinking they are watching a fairy tale as opposed to a team that has dominated with pitching and demonstrated that its lineup may be inferior to no one s \? the series is not over , and we will see what happens at wrigley but cespedes , good as he has been , was only a part of the mets' tradedeadline and posttradedeadline upgrade the return of wright and travis d'arnaud from injuries , the promotion of michael conforto from the minors , the streaky power of lucas duda and the realization of granderson as much more than a beneficiary of the yankee stadium rightfield porch have all been instrumental in the fashioning of a lineup with excellent length it is one that has now beaten clayton kershaw , zack greinke , jon lester and arrieta in a little more than a week , the narrative ever changing while the false ones of yesterday continue to fade remember when terry collins was no more than a caretaker , not a manager for the long haul \? when sandy alderson was a general manager long past his prime \? when the mets were sunk by the spring drug suspension of closer jenrry mejia \? when even after their surge they were supposedly only capable of beating bad teams \? when , seemingly 20 minutes ago , matt harvey was selfish and a biggame choke artist to boot \? alongside syndergaard , wright was asked about this october , and this is what he said yeah , i mean , we 've beaten some of the best that the game has to offer , but i 'll argue that we have the syndergaards , the harveys , the matzes and the degroms , so i like our chances when we can run those guys out there but just an amazing run for us offensively to be able to get to some of these guys early and then allow these starters to go out there at the mention of these guys , who are his guys , wright glanced at syndergaard , with his flowing blond locks falling from under a blueandorange wool hat from balmy florida to blustery october , how much have we learned about talent , potential and how much the plot can thicken \?
helsinki , finland getting a speeding ticket is not a feelgood moment for anyone but consider reima kuisla , a finnish businessman he was recently fined 54 , 024 euros \( about 58 , 000 \) for traveling a modest , if illegal , 64 miles per hour in a 50 mph zone and no , the 54 , 024 euros did not turn out to be a typo , or a mistake of any kind mr kuisla is a millionaire , and in the fines for more serious speeding infractions are calculated according to income the thinking here is that if it stings for the little guy , it should sting for the big guy , too the ticket had its desired effect mr kuisla , 61 , with 12 furious posts in which he included a picture of his speeding ticket and a picture of what 54 , 024 euros could buy if it were not going to the state coffers a new mercedes he said he was seriously considering leaving finland altogether , a position to which he held firm when reached by phone at a bar where he was watching horse races the way things are done here makes no sense , mr kuisla sputtered , saying he would not be giving interviews before hanging up , he added for what and for whom does this society exist \? it is hard to say the nordic countries have long had a strong egalitarian streak , embracing progressive taxation and high levels of social spending perhaps less well known is that they also practice progressive punishment , when it comes to certain fines a rich person , many citizens here believe , should pay more for the same offense if justice is to be served the question is how much more \? on his facebook page , quite a few of mr kuisla s friends offered their sympathy but that did not seem to be the drift of public opinion elsewhere , it was easier to find finns who were shrugging over his predicament at the university of helsinki , jussi lahti , 35 , a graduate student in geography , said that he could understand why mr kuisla was upset , but that he considered the principle of an equal percentage fair and , he added , mr kuisla had a choice when he decided to speed the size of mr kuisla s ticket nonetheless drew considerable attention here as television shows and newspapers debated the merits of finland s system , which uses a complex formula based on income to calculate an individual s fines some wondered whether the government should stop imposing such fines for infractions at relatively low speeds some suggested that a fine so big was really a form of taxation but the idea that the rich should pay heavier fines did not seem to be much in question it is an old system , said pasi kemppainen , chief superintendent at the national police board it may lead to high fines , but only for people who can afford it in fact , the finnish day fine system , also in use in some other scandinavian countries , dates to the 1920s , when fines based on income were instituted for all manner of lesser crimes , such as petty theft and assault , and helped greatly reduce the prison population the fines are calculated based on half an offender s daily net income , with some consideration for the number of children under his or her roof and a deduction deemed to be enough to cover basic living expenses , currently 255 euros per month then , that figure is multiplied by the number of days of income the offender should lose , according to the severity of the offense mr kuisla , a betting man who parlayed his winnings into a real estate empire , was clocked speeding near the seinajoki airport given the speed he was going , mr kuisla was assessed eight days his fine was then calculated from his 2013 income , 6 , 559 , 742 euros , or more than 7 million at current exchange rates someone committing a similar offense and earning about 50 , 000 euros a year , or 54 , 000 , none of it capital gains , and with no young children , would get a fine of about 345 euros , or about 370 someone earning 300 , 000 euros \( 322 , 000 \) , would have to pay about 1 , 480 euros \( 1 , 590 \) when the day fine system was devised for petty crimes , finland did not even have any speed limits on its roads those did not arrive until the 1970s back then , the police had to rely on the honor system , that is , asking drivers to declare their incomes , before calculating the fine it seems not everyone was forthcoming in today s digital age , however , a few seconds is all it takes for the police , using mobile devices , to get information directly from the finnish tax office police officials say that there are really very few tickets issued of this magnitude , though they do not keep track until he was issued the speeding ticket , mr kuisla used his facebook page largely to post pictures of his winning horses or the lobbies and bars of the hotels he owns but the ticket seemed to focus his attention on finnish policies that he said discouraged entrepreneurs , apparently a reference to the country s progressive tax system and its high inheritance taxes high earners can face an income tax rate of more than 50 percent finland is now an impossible country to live in for people with a large income and wealth ! he posted on march 2 but online comments in newspapers suggested a strong showing for the other side this says a lot about the times when the stinkingly rich ca n't even take their fines for crimes , but are immediately moving out of the country farewell , we wo n't miss you , said one post in the helsingin sanomat , a daily newspaper and website but the ticket has tapped into a broader debate about the coherence of the finnish justice system mr kuisla s speeding infraction is actually classified as a crime here , which could seem severe when other parts of the system are relatively lenient for instance , people convicted of murder could serve as little as nine years and could be released in four and a half years , said kimmo kiiski , a senior transport adviser at the ministry of transport and communications he said that a commission considering such issues was expected to finish a report next year , and that it would probably move speeding tickets out of the criminal justice system altogether and stop levying such large fines for lowerend speeding tickets mr kuisla , mr kiiski pointed out , would have gotten a fine of about 100 euros if he had been traveling three kilometers per hour slower that kind of difference is too big , mr kiiski said there has to be some difference depending on income or there would be no justice but not that kind of difference mr kuisla s 58 , 000 ticket is not even the most severe speeding ticket issued in recent years according to another daily newspaper , ilkka , mr kuisla himself got an even bigger fine in 2013 when he was going about 76 mph in a 50 mph zone that ticket was for 63 , 448 euros , about 83 , 769 at the time bigger yet was the ticket issued to a 44yearold nokia executive in 2002 , when he was on his harley motorcycle and was hit with a 103 , 600 fine , based on a 125 million yearly income both tickets were appealed and in the end reduced usually , appeals are based on financial issues , such as a onetime sale of stock that year but judges have great leeway , experts said mr kuisla ended up paying 5 , 346 euros for the 2013 ticket
bayeun , indonesia mohammed salim sat on a straw mat in an openair tent , trying to avoid the stifling midday heat the 23yearold still appeared to be recovering from dehydration and mild malnutrition he was among the 433 migrants from and who had been aboard a on may 14 , adrift in the andaman sea near thailand and malaysia they had been on the boat for three months , abandoned by their captain and crew , and were desperate for food and water since their boat landed on the northern coast of the indonesian island of sumatra last week , the passengers have lived here , in tents on the grounds of an abandoned paper factory that has become a government migrant camp they sleep on mats or wooden pallets on the muddy ground , a thin sarong for a blanket , and bathe by collecting buckets of water from a well in a clinic staffed by volunteer and government doctors and nurses , the ceiling is caving in and some patients lie on the floor with iv drips in their arms mr salim dreams of living in a strong country , he said america , australia , anywhere for the foreseeable future , however , mr salim and the more than 1 , 800 other migrants who arrived in this month are not going anywhere indonesia s minister of social affairs , khofifah indar parawansa , whose ministry oversees the camps , said the migrants would remain where they are in my opinion , the existing camps now are good enough , she said in an interview , adding that the shelters provided for indonesians who were displaced by a volcano eruption in 2014 were similarly spartan of course , this is indonesian standard in addition to the paper factory in the village of bayeun , just outside the town of langsa in aceh province , the migrants are living in similar conditions in three other camps in aceh , including warehouses in a small stateowned port that is also near langsa , and an abandoned beachfront government compound near the town of lhoksukon , a twohour drive to the north , where they sleep on concrete floors aid groups are concerned that the conditions are unsanitary , could potentially spread disease and were never intended for longterm habitation these are shortterm camps , said steve hamilton , deputy chief of mission of the in jakarta none of them are really designed to be lived in if a storm comes through they are not designed for storms while mr hamilton credits the government with finding immediate shelter for the migrants , he and other aid workers said the government needed to quickly come up with a mediumterm housing solution like dormitories this was never intended to be a longerterm site , said thomas vargas , chief representative of the united nations high commissioner for refugees in jakarta , the indonesian capital it was an attempt by the government , and with the best of intentions , to provide for everybody when they arrived and meet urgent needs but i think everyone understands there are some gaps to fill and things to be addressed in terms of taking care of sanitary conditions and taking care of women and children international aid organizations say the migrants need facilities including canteens and schools for hundreds of children last week , to take in as many as 7 , 000 migrants for up to a year the bangladeshis , who are considered economic migrants , are likely to be repatriated , while the rohingya , who are seeking asylum , may eventually be settled in a third country indonesia and malaysia , however , did not specify how the migrants would be sheltered before this latest wave of migrants , indonesia already had around 12 , 000 registered asylum seekers and official refugees , according to the united nations high commissioner for refugees , most of whom are from south asia and the middle east and were trying to resettle in australia or a western country around 4 , 800 of them are being held in detention centers across the country , but the rest are either living in private accommodation with financing from international aid groups , or using their own funds mr hamilton , of the international organization for migration , said the indonesian government should absorb this most recent wave of rohingya into its asylumseeker population rather than leave them in makeshift camps he said the eventual repatriation of around 800 bangladeshis could take several months because of the slow process of confirming their citizenship in addition , he said , the process of finding a third country to accept the approximately 1 , 000 rohingya could take far longer than the oneyear deadline set by the indonesian and malaysian governments even if the countries say they want them out in a year , it s not necessarily a year , he said how the migrant groups fare remains to be seen there have been minor fights between the men from bangladesh and myanmar , also known as burma , who are segregated in each camp , according to aid workers the clinics initially treated migrants for exhaustion , dehydration and infections , though aid workers warn that disease could easily sweep through a large population living cheek by jowl in an enclosed area but given that only days ago they were in danger of drowning at sea or dying of exhaustion , starvation or lack of water , there have been few complaints since the first boat drifted ashore in aceh on may 10 in fact , migrants said they have been overwhelmed by the welcome they have received from the indonesians local governments , nongovernmental organizations and volunteer groups in aceh and north sumatra provinces mobilized to help the migrant camps , while local communities rallied to donate food , water , clothing , children s toys and even cash local residents have come to the camps to look around , take photos on cellphones with the rohingya and bangladeshi and even give them motorcycle rides around the compound , which one aid worker disapprovingly called migrant tourism at the kuala cangkoi migrant camp near lhoksukon , the indonesian red cross had to lay barbed wire around the medical clinic to keep local residents from milling about there were also reports of indonesians stealing donated clothes and food from the camp we 've cut off entry to anyone but the migrants so we can work , said chaidir , 37 , a member of the humanitarian group palang merah indonesia who , like many indonesians , goes by one name for mr salim , the conditions are not a concern , mostly because he is alive asked about what lies ahead , he said i do n't understand the word future in the future , i wanted to learn computers , but in burma , all i was thinking about was how long would it be before i'm dead
tashfeen malik , the woman accused by law enforcement officials of killing 14 people and injuring 21 others in a california conference center alongside her husband wednesday , remains largely a mystery to both investigators and her relatives in , who have responded to her actions with shock and horror officials said ms malik pledged allegiance to the islamic state group in a facebook status posted on the day of the attack , but they cautioned that there was no evidence that the terrorist group had directed the rampage there was little information about ms malik s past or her path to radicalization relatives in pakistan who spoke to reporters in the days after the attack described ms malik , 29 , as a bright and religious young woman who appeared to have a promising future they struggled to reconcile the woman they thought they knew with what the authorities said was a blackclad assailant who walked into the inland regional center in san bernardino shortly after leaving her 6monthold daughter with her motherinlaw hours after the rampage , ms malik and her husband , syed rizwan farook , were killed in a gun battle with the police all relatives here are shocked to hear about it , said javed rabbani aulakh , an uncle of ms malik s in pakistan he remembered her as the young woman who moved back to the country of her birth in 2007 to study pharmacology at bahauddin zakariya university she was conservative , he said , but appeared to have no interest in extremism or violence ms malik moved to saudi arabia with her father when she was young , her relatives told reporters , after an inheritance dispute between her father and their extended family led to a bitter falling out the relatives said they believed it was there that both father and daughter developed radical political and religious beliefs from what we heard , they lived differently , their mindset is different , hifza bibi , a stepsister of ms malik s father , she said the family was originally from a land of sufi saints , a reference to a mystical and openminded interpretation of islam that is looked upon with scorn by more conservative or radical adherents of the faith however , a spokesman for the saudi interior ministry , maj gen mansour turki , said by text message on saturday that ms malik did not live in saudi arabia but twice came to visit her father , who works in the kingdom , in 2008 and 2013 the reason for the discrepancy between the accounts of ms malik s relatives and the saudi authorities was not immediately clear ms bibi said that ms malik s father cut himself off from the rest of the family after he moved to saudi arabia he does n't care about anyone here , she said a man who did n't come to attend his own mother s funeral , what can you expect from him \? despite her father s estrangement from relatives in pakistan , ms malik returned to the country in 2007 to pursue a degree in pharmacology at bahauddin zakariya university , in the city of multan nisar hussain , one of ms malik s professors , said she had been a who at one point was at the top of her class in the university s department of pharmacology ,  she was religious , but a very normal person as well , said dr hussain she was a very hardworking and submissive student she never created any problem in the class she was an obedient girl i cannot even imagine she could murder people he said he did not believe ms malik had any kind of mental illness one relative , who spoke to on the condition of anonymity , said that ms malik s religious beliefs seemed to change during her time at the university and that relatives sometimes worried about her radical postings on social media ms malik also began to talk online with friends in arabic , a language that her family members in pakistan did not speak , according to the relative , who said they spoke urdu and a dialect of punjabi called saraiki none of our family members in pakistan know arabic , so we do not know what she used to discuss , the relative said ms malik left school in 2012 and moved to the united states two years later , after she met mr farook , an american citizen living in california , on a dating website she applied for and was granted a k1 visa , also known as the fianc visa , in pakistan in july 2014 and traveled to the united states that month
last year , began one long , final spin around the globe , under the banner of its official adi s tour the operative word there is adi s , and it carries more than the usual implications of a band bidding its audience farewell a feeling of departure weighed heavily , often dispiritingly , on the ensemble s soldout concert on wednesday , its second of two nights at the beacon theater , and its last scheduled stop in the continental united states buena vista social club was , of course , an album born of discovery and nostalgia named after a popular musicians' haunt in havana that had closed in the 1940s , it turned a spotlight on veteran cuban musicians , some of them well into retirement , if not a faded obscurity the album was produced by ry cooder , the american guitarist and rootsmusic polymath , and released in 1997 on world circuit records , eventually selling millions of copies worldwide , winning a grammy award , and inspiring a documentary film of the same name time and attrition have exacted a toll on the group , in ways that the concert took pains to honor , with unintentionally selfdeflating results montages of archival photographs and concert footage periodically played on a screen behind the stage , in memorial tribute to former band members this only sharpened the impression that orquesta buena vista social club is , at this point , a shadow of an echo maybe that sounds harsh , but here are the names of those departed musicians , in the order by which they were honored on screen the pianist rub n gonz lez \( 19192003 \) the bassist orlando l pez , known as cacha to \( 19332009 \) the singer ibrahim ferrer \( 19272005 \) the singer and guitarist compay segundo \( 19072003 \) and the singers p o leyva \( 19172006 \) and ma uel licea , known as puntillita \( 19272000 \) none were expendable none are replaceable there are , to be clear , some fine musicians in the ranks rolando luna s piano playing was full of energy and clarity , though a bit overeager and the trumpeter luis mirabal \( known as guajirito \) did standout work in a section that also included his grandfather luis manuel mirabal \( known as guajiro \) idania vald s and carlos calunga made up a lean , likable vocal team but mr cooder is no longer involved with the project nor is the cuban bandleader juan de marcos gonz lez , a catalyst for the original album who subsequently served as musical director , helping to turn an assemblage of musicians into an indivisible touring band the current bandleader of orquesta buena vista social club , the trombonist and singer jes s ramos , known as aguaje , exuded an industrious pep , but it was n't often that he pulled the band into unforced high gear one such moment came on , a soulful descarga originally recorded for the 2001 album cacha to \( it appears on a compilation called lost and found , released on world circuit this spring \) along with a burbling , percussive groove , it featured a typically thrilling la d solo by barbarito torres , an original member of the group orquesta buena vista social club includes two other original members , and each had time to shine eliades ochoa , whose soaring voice and rhythmic guitar playing were always a core feature of the group , began his miniset with a signature original , estoy como nunca , and followed it with mr ochoa s voice has lost some vibrancy and luster but none of its power as he proved again later in the show , on a persuasively rousing chan chan the other featured artist was the singer omara portuondo , who emerged to a standing ovation that she proceeded to justify with her performance ms portuondo recently turned 85 , and frailty has caught up with her movements but her voice was regal and her phrasing relaxed she worked with a frisky , curling cadence on quiz s , quiz s , quiz s , and seemed to surprise the band when she took a detour from into b same mucho , which elicited a singalong but even in ms portuondo s triumph there were flickers of sadness for an encore , she sang dos gardenias , a bolero famously sung by mr ferrer she has her own history with the song , and shared it here with the young spanish jazz singer andrea motis , the concert s opening act but for anyone who had been missing mr ferrer s exquisite tenor like a phantom limb , the moment was a bittersweet reminder of farewells already made , as well as those yet to come
i look forward eagerly , almost greedily , to the weekly arrival of journals like nature and science , and turn at once to articles on the physical sciences not , as perhaps i should , to articles on biology and medicine it was the physical sciences that provided my first enchantment as a boy in a recent issue of nature , there was a thrilling article by the nobel prizewinning physicist frank wilczek on a new way of calculating the slightly different masses of neutrons and protons the new calculation confirms that neutrons are very slightly heavier than protons the ratio of their masses being 93956563 to 93827231 a trivial difference , one might think , but if it were otherwise the universe as we know it could never have developed the ability to calculate this , dr wilczek wrote , encourages us to predict a future in which nuclear physics reaches the level of precision and versatility that atomic physics has already achieved a revolution that , alas , i will never see francis crick was convinced that the hard problem understanding how the brain gives rise to consciousness would be solved by 2030 you will see it , he often said to my neuroscientist friend ralph , and you may , too , oliver , if you live to my age crick lived to his late 80s , working and thinking about consciousness till the last ralph died prematurely , at age 52 , and now i am terminally ill , at the age of 82 i have to say that i am not too exercised by the hard problem of consciousness indeed , i do not see it as a problem at all but i am sad that i will not see the new nuclear physics that dr wilczek envisages , nor a thousand other breakthroughs in the physical and biological sciences a few weeks ago , in the country , far from the lights of the city , i saw the entire sky powdered with stars \( in milton s words \) such a sky , i imagined , could be seen only on high , dry plateaus like that of atacama in chile \( where some of the world s most powerful telescopes are \) it was this celestial splendor that suddenly made me realize how little time , how little life , i had left my sense of the heavens' beauty , of eternity , was inseparably mixed for me with a sense of transience and death i told my friends kate and allen , i would like to see such a sky again when i am dying we 'll wheel you outside , they said i have been comforted , since i wrote in february about , by the hundreds of letters i have received , the expressions of love and appreciation , and the sense that \( despite everything \) i may have lived a good and useful life i remain very glad and grateful for all this yet none of it hits me as did that night sky full of stars i have tended since early boyhood to deal with loss losing people dear to me by turning to the nonhuman when i was sent away to a boarding school as a child of 6 , at the outset of the second world war , numbers became my friends when i returned to london at 10 , the elements and the periodic table became my companions times of stress throughout my life have led me to turn , or return , to the physical sciences , a world where there is no life , but also no death and now , at this juncture , when death is no longer an abstract concept , but a presence an alltooclose , nottobedenied presence i am again surrounding myself , as i did when i was a boy , with metals and minerals , little emblems of eternity at one end of my writing table , i have element 81 in a charming box , sent to me by elementfriends in england it says , happy thallium birthday , a souvenir of my 81st birthday last july then , a realm devoted to lead , element 82 , for my just celebrated 82nd birthday earlier this month here , too , is a little lead casket , containing element 90 , thorium , crystalline thorium , as beautiful as diamonds , and , of course , radioactive hence the lead casket at the start of the year , in the weeks after i learned that i had cancer , i pretty well , despite my liver being halfoccupied by metastases when the cancer in my liver was treated in february by the injection of tiny beads into the hepatic arteries a procedure called embolization i felt awful for a couple of weeks but then super well , charged with physical and mental energy \( the metastases had almost all been wiped out by the embolization \) i had been given not a remission , but an intermission , a time to deepen friendships , to see patients , to write , and to travel back to my homeland , england people could scarcely believe at this time that i had a terminal condition , and i could easily forget it myself this sense of health and energy started to decline as may moved into june , but i was able to celebrate my 82nd birthday in style \( auden used to say that one should celebrate one s birthday , no matter how one felt \) but now , i have some nausea and loss of appetite chills in the day , sweats at night and , above all , a pervasive tiredness , with sudden exhaustion if i overdo things i continue to swim daily , but more slowly now , as i am beginning to feel a little short of breath i could deny it before , but i i am ill now a ct scan on july 7 confirmed that the metastases had not only regrown in my liver but had now spread beyond it as well i started a new sort of treatment immunotherapy last week it is not without its hazards , but i hope it will give me a few more good months but before beginning this , i wanted to have a little fun a trip to north carolina to see the wonderful lemur research center at duke university lemurs are close to the ancestral stock from which all primates arose , and i am happy to think that one of my own ancestors , 50 million years ago , was a little treedwelling creature not so dissimilar to the lemurs of today i love their leaping vitality , their inquisitive nature next to the circle of lead on my table is the land of bismuth naturally occurring bismuth from australia little limousineshaped ingots of bismuth from a mine in bolivia bismuth slowly cooled from a melt to form beautiful iridescent crystals terraced like a hopi village and , in a nod to euclid and the beauty of geometry , a cylinder and a sphere made of bismuth bismuth is element 83 i do not think i will see my 83rd birthday , but i feel there is something hopeful , something encouraging , about having 83 around moreover , i have a soft spot for bismuth , a modest gray metal , often unregarded , ignored , even by metal lovers my feeling as a doctor for the mistreated or marginalized extends into the inorganic world and finds a parallel in my feeling for bismuth i almost certainly will not see my polonium \( 84th \) birthday , nor would i want any polonium around , with its intense , murderous radioactivity but then , at the other end of my table my periodic table i have a beautifully machined piece of beryllium \( element 4 \) to remind me of my childhood , and of how long ago my soontoend life began
zawiyah , libya the nomoneydown offer was too tempting for the children to resist smugglers had offered the boys and girls transportation out of the refugee camps along the eritrean border , across the african deserts and the mediterranean sea , to a new life in europe there , they could quickly win asylum and bring along their parents , the smugglers assured them payment could come later by the time the smugglers had conveyed the boys and girls to , however , the offer had become an ultimatum the children , some as young as 8 , called their parents to relay a demand from the smugglers for more than 3 , 200 for parents , failure to send the money meant abandoning their sons and daughters to the chaos of libya zackarias hilo , 19 , the oldest of about 40 eritrean boys held by the authorities here at the time of a recent visit , said his father had initially exclaimed that he was too poor to pay then i am dead ! zackarias replied so to come up with the payment , my father went to the old city to sell all his goats , zackarias said it was the same for all of us , he said , surveying the younger boys adult refugees who traveled with them confirmed their accounts , which aid workers said were common in the case of one 8yearold , a father in and a sister in norway provided corroboration as well there are about 80 eritrean boys and girls now imprisoned in two detention centers here ill prepared to evaluate the smugglers' offers , such children are among the most innocent victims of the human smuggling machine that is now sucking so many african migrants into the libyan maelstrom and out onto the mediterranean waters out of roughly 170 , 000 migrants arriving in italy by sea from libya last year , more than 13 , 000 were children traveling alone , and 3 , 394 of those were eritrean , according to the , an intergovernmental agency based in geneva in just the first few weeks of this year s peak sailing season , about 30 , 000 have crossed , including more than 5 , 000 so far this month and a total of more than 1 , 680 unaccompanied minors more than 50 children , including some traveling with their parents , are believed to have drowned along with 700 others when their overloaded boat capsized in april on tuesday , aid groups said that as many as 40 other migrants had drowned as well , and last year , hundreds of children died the same way the families being extorted by the smugglers are invariably already impoverished in , the average per capita income is about 550 a year , according to the most recent world bank figures , so meeting the smugglers' ransom can consume the savings of a whole village or more the smugglers are very creative , said meron estefanos , an eritrean rights activist in stockholm who works with migrants once the smuggler gets the children to libya , the parents have no option but to send money , because there is no return if the children reach europe , she said , the first thing they ask me is always , can i bring my parents \? ' the unaccompanied children come from many countries , including 1 , 481 from somalia , 1 , 208 from gambia and 945 from syria last year , according to the international organization for migration in some cases , parents may consciously send children in the hope that they will be more likely to win asylum but the largest number of unaccompanied children come from eritrea , a dictatorship so severe it is sometimes likened to north korea western countries grant asylum to almost every arriving eritrean and the eritrean children , aid workers say , often slip away without the knowledge of their parents eritrea drafts every man and woman as young as 18 into a brutal system of military service that frequently lasts many years and can amount to slave labor at staterun industrial projects to escape , hundreds of thousands of adults have fled , often to refugee camps across the hilly border with ethiopia each year , hundreds of unaccompanied children following the same footsteps walk into ethiopia the camps currently house more than 1 , 500 without their parents , aid workers say they are referred to as orphans' inside the camps , said john stauffer , founder of the , a nonprofit group efrem fitwi and hermon angosom , 8yearolds at the detention center here , appeared in about migrants in libya i saw what happened to my brothers i saw my future , efrem said when asked at more length about his journey we do n't have any education , he said , squatting on the dirt courtyard of the detention center and speaking tigrinya , a language native to eritrea and ethiopia , while zackarias translated my brothers and sisters do n't have any school so we want to go to ethiopia most children who make the trek without telling their parents regret it as soon as they arrive , aid workers say but eritrea considers them defectors and criminals , barring any return they get stuck there in the camps , ms estefanos said it is very common the camps are also where the smugglers trawl for passengers efrem and other eritrean boys in the libyan detention center said their smuggler was ermias ghermay , an ethiopian who is wanted by the italian police for the drowning of 366 migrants off the coast of lampedusa in 2013 his name resurfaced recently in italian news reports about a police recording of a telephone call in which smugglers discussed where to invest their millions in profits they say i let too many people board the boats , mered medhanie , a 34yearold eritrean smuggler nicknamed the general , reportedly said but they 're the ones who want to leave right away from the refugee camps in ethiopia near the eritrean border , mr ghermay s crew packed the children in the back of a truck with a dozen other migrants to drive west to sudan and then north to libya , children and adult passengers said hermon and several other boys and girls said it was in sudan that they first called their families hermon called his older sister , haben , 22 she had recently traveled a similar route across the mediterranean and had finally reached norway , where she applied for asylum , she said in a telephone interview having experienced the journey s perils , she pleaded with hermon to turn back or stay in sudan anything but continue to libya and she initially persuaded him , both said but after they hung up , hermon felt afraid to stay alone in sudan and unsure how to go back , he said in an interview in the detention center we do n't have friends in sudan , we do n't have family there , and i am small and i am scared , hermon said i missed my mother and my father , so i wanted to get to the outside he allowed the smugglers to carry him on despite his sister s warnings the smugglers held hermon captive in a squalid collection house somewhere in western libya neither the boys nor the adults who traveled with them knew where until his sister in norway could send enough money , about 1 , 600 for the ride to libya and another 1 , 600 or 1 , 800 for the boat ride into the mediterranean he waited four weeks while she begged for money from family and friends finally , in the dark of night , the smugglers put hermon and efrem in an inflatable dinghy to carry them out to a fishing boat packed with more than 200 others the engine failed almost immediately , so they were pulled back to shore and arrested now , at the libyan detention centers , the boys and girls spend most of their time caged in concrete bunkers the boys on thin pads on the floor , the girls on rows of beds that fill the floor space the food is little more than rice and macaroni there are few opportunities for recreation and no chance of education the united nations refugee agency has largely withdrawn from libya because of the escalating violence so have most other international aid groups each of the centers held more than 400 adults as well as about 40 children , many apparently younger than puberty none of the boys and girls knew where they were or how they might get out many of the children speak only limited arabic in an eritrean dialect , and none of the guards speak tigrinya hermon was stoic at first then a visiting journalist said he had reached hermon s father in eritrea , who was glad to hear news of his son at that , hermon hid his face to weep , uncontrollably later , hermon was given a phone by a visiting journalist and allowed to call his mother but his guards insisted they stay in the room , and then mocked him for crying there he goes , crying and fussing to his mama , but his parents are the ones who sent him , a jailer said , accusing him of fabricating stories of mistreatment had he told his parent he was well treated , another asked , threateningly i told them i am in libya , hermon said in arabic i told them i am in prison another boy of about 8 , filimon burust , was allowed to speak by phone to ms estefanos , the rights activist he alternated between childlike terror and adult suspicion , she said i am not going to tell you where my father is , he told ms estefanos , warily just tell my mother to tell my father where i am she knows where he is hermon s sister , haben , had lied to her parents , assuring them that hermon was safely on his way , but her lie was exposed when ms estefanos reached his father in reality , haben said she had previously spoken only with the smuggler , mr ghermay he demanded another 600 for a bribe to secure hermon s release from detention , then put him back on another dangerous boat is my sister doing anything to help me , hermon asked in a phone call with ms estefanos was the price of his release in american dollars or libyan dinars \? you just concentrate on taking care of yourself , ms estefanos said she told him
abuja , nigeria on my second visit to chibok , i slept with a machete tucked between the headboard of the bed and the dresser , wondering if the reddish stains on the blade were rust or blood across the hallway , i saw a wooden door with shredded panels when i asked my friend about it , he said that some boko haram members had clawed through that door a few months ago in an attempt to attack the homeowner , a friend of his my friend , a chibok native and also a vigilante fighter against the islamist militants , said that the owner no longer slept there but he told me to make myself comfortable sleeping across from that tattered door , i knew that i had once again come close to boko haram i had returned to chibok , curious to see how the march presidential elections would go down in this town , which has become a symbol of boko haram s disturbing penchant for abducting girls chibok , in s northeastern borno region , became worldfamous in april 2014 when boko haram fighters abducted from the local high school more than 200 are  as i walked around chibok on election day , most people told me they had voted for the former army general muhammadu buhari , banking on his promise to fight boko haram chibok residents were disillusioned with the ineffectual response to the security crisis of the incumbent president , goodluck jonathan the first time i visited chibok , a few weeks after the mass abduction , i saw no soldiers this time , chibok was better protected the soldiers stationed there allowed me and my friend to leave on the sunday after election day i was headed back to abuja , but we were traveling with some government officials who needed to drop off chibok s ballot boxes at a nearby town called biu , and we planned to stop there , too as we left , the sky grew suddenly dark my friend turned off the headlights we do n't want to attract , he said he drove at a crawl , maneuvering over the bumps in the dirt road on either side was nothing but untouched wilderness finally , we reached damboa , a city about 20 miles north of chibok that had once been a haven for boko haram recruitment soldiers there told us there was no way we could proceed the road ahead was just too dangerous , they said just hours earlier , they 'd exchanged fire with a group of boko haram fighters and dismantled a checkpoint the militants had set up so we slept in the car on the side of the road in damboa when i awoke , the light of dawn revealed a marketplace where the stalls were charred and melted car parts lay about my friend said it had recently been attacked we took off at 7 am , thanking the soldiers for keeping watch over us the sky was bright and clear beside our two vehicles , there were no other cars on the road thirty minutes out of damboa , we were driving through an abandoned village called kuboa , a known waypoint for boko haram fighters moving to and from their camps in a nearby forest in kuboa , i saw a corpse the color of the man s shirt was indistinguishable from the blood spilled from his body my gaze was still on him when i heard the first explosion instinctively , i shrank down in the seat , tucking my knees beneath the glove compartment and stifling any noise i knew that calmness was the key i looked over at my friend , watching his fingers curl tighter around the steering wheel , eyebrows gather and lips purse his hunting rifle rested by his knee we both understood that stopping the car to use the rifle could be fatal three boko haram fighters in mufti , with blackandwhite cloth tied around their heads , stood in the road on my side , carrying ak47s two more , clad in camouflage , bearing rocketpropelled grenade launchers , were on my friend s side behind them were acres upon acres of rolling grassland bullets rattled against the side of the car the smell of gunpowder and pops from rifles collided with my senses my friend floored the gas pedal the car was racing almost as fast as my heartbeat i guessed they were aiming at the tires we lost sight of our four companions , the officials driving behind us we kept speeding until we were out of earshot of the gunfire our companions caught up their car had a cracked windshield , bullet holes everywhere , and one side looked almost ripped off by a hit from a rocketpropelled grenade miraculously , none of them were injured when we reached a checkpoint , we reported the incident to the soldiers we had encountered the hitandrun militants who villagers said use magic charms to disappear into the air young women who had lived in forced captivity with boko haram told me that they acted like men not from this world in interviews i 've conducted , victims described boko haram as demonic or ghosts reporting on boko haram over the years had brought me close , but never as close as that day not even in the town of buni yadi , where boko haram had slaughtered dozens of boys at a high school last year bloodied strips of school uniforms dangled on glass shards still attached to the burnedout window frames to many , the faces of boko haram are still a mystery , hidden behind an impenetrable religious austerity and desperation but the people in the northeast hope that this new president has the political will to tackle the insurgency boko haram is a mindless , godless group who are as far away from islam as one can think of , mr buhari said during his may inauguration his own identity as a muslim from northern nigeria gives him authority on the issue but this military man , who no longer wants to be referred to as general , also knows that it s his military experience that many nigerians hope will help him defeat boko haram , once and for all but mr buhari faces another challenge nigeria s divided reality those who live in southern nigeria have little idea of the brutal forces ripping through communities like damboa , kubwa and chibok i 've even heard whispers that the insurgency is a hoax the scope of the violence seems too great for them to comprehend when i talk to people in the south , i sometimes hear a sense of invincibility , a notion that boko haram is not a real threat because it could never penetrate into southern nigeria mr buhari , at least , knows the danger and means to stop it those of us who have seen boko haram up close hope he succeeds
here s a look at the best games of , and who we think will win them a debate has emerged on whether this cardinals team , which is one win from the franchise s first 12victory season , is the best in team history but that is selling the 1948 chicago cardinals short , not to mention the 1925 and 1947 teams , which won nfl championships despite not winning a title , the 1948 team may have been the best it won 11 games , like the current cardinals , but in a 12game regular season , its only loss coming against the crosstown chicago bears in the second game its average margin of victory was 141 points this year s is 118 the 1948 cardinals reached the nfl championship game , losing to the eagles ray mallouf , mal kutner and elmer angsman led that 1948 team to an nflleading 329 points per game , slightly more than the 312 points averaged by this year s squad , with an aerial attack led by carson palmer a key for the cardinals has been their depth larry fitzgerald has been their leading receiver , but john brown , michael floyd or j j nelson can also deliver a huge catch and with running backs chris johnson and andre ellington out with injuries , the rookie david johnson has proved himself capable of being an everydown back the eagles have played up to their competition in recent weeks , with wins against new england and buffalo , but against a relentless cardinals defense that is fourth in the nfl in yards allowed per game and fifth against the rush , it is hard to see them coming away with a victory the broncos continue to trudge along in what has to be among the most tumultuous 103 seasons in history their highpriced future hall of fame quarterback , peyton manning , was 72 as a starter even though , after missing four games , he continues to lead the league in interceptions by a wide margin his backup , brock osweiler , is 31 but seemed almost incapable of finishing drives last week , with more than 300 passing yards but no touchdowns denver has gotten away with subpar quarterbacking and an inconsistent rushing attack because of its impressive defense that unit will have its hands full with a redhot pittsburgh offense that has scored 30 or more points in five consecutive games while averaging 494 yards of offense though manning has practiced , he is not quite ready to return , so osweiler will start again he is likely to put up plenty of yards against a steelers defense that has been among the worst against the pass but expecting him to keep up with his pittsburgh counterpart , ben roethlisberger , is asking too much when a team has a shutdown cornerback like josh norman of the panthers , a lot of the attention ends up being focused on the other side of the field that looked as if it would be an issue this week , with bene benwikere , who had been manning the no 2 corner spot , breaking his leg against atlanta the options to replace benwikere appeared limited until charles tillman , who had been out with a knee injury , practiced during the week and may be ready to reclaim his starting role on offense , quarterback cam newton has been impressive manufacturing offense with a ragtag group of wide receivers , but the panthers will lose some flexibility with running back jonathan stewart out with a foot injury it could be even worse for carolina if tight end greg olsen is limited by a knee injury he aggravated last week the giants beat the 130 broncos in 1998 and the 180 patriots in the february 2008 super bowl , and they may be poised to take down another unbeaten this weekend last season , the bills had the defense no one wanted to play against it led the nfl with 54 sacks , was sixth in interceptions and was tied for 10th in fumble recoveries led by mario williams , marcell dareus and jerry hughes , the team added coach rex ryan , a defensive specialist , and was expected to get even better but through 13 games , the bills have 19 sacks , ranking 30th in the nfl they are also 13th in total yards allowed per game literally i can count this will be my first time that i 've ever been considered maybe the weakness of the team , the way i coach defense , ryan told reporters but we have n't been up to what we anticipated , any of us , fan base , myself , players , everybody needing to win the rest of their games to have a realistic chance at the playoffs , the bills this week will have to contend with redskins quarterback kirk cousins , who has had a passer rating higher than 100 in five of the last seven weeks \( including a perfect 1583 in week 10 \) and has his team tied for first place in the nfc east the redskins have not won consecutive games since weeks 7 and 8 last season , but that streak should end sunday the raiders have held opposing teams to fewer than 100 yards rushing in eight of their last 11 games , but in two of the other three they were burned for a combined 495 yards on the ground , by pittsburgh and minnesota oakland could be in for another long day against packers running back eddie lacy , who has rushed for more than 100 yards in three of his last four games and looked comfortable last week with coach mike mccarthy calling the plays again with quarterback aaron rodgers having a rough season by his standards , and raiders defensive end khalil mack having emerged as one of the most terrifying pass rushers in the game , it may come down to lacy and james starks running green bay to a road win but the dynamic duo is up to the task a j mccarron versus blaine gabbert who saw that coming \? while mccarron looks to be the first alabama quarterback to win an nfl game since 1987 , gabbert will continue his onthejob audition to be the 49ers' quarterback of the future it is an underwhelming pairing compared with what before the season was projected to be the polished andy dalton \( who broke his thumb last week \) versus the athletic colin kaepernick \( who was benched and subsequently put on injured reserve \) but mccarron and gabbert have shown an ability to move the ball , so it is a rare instance when a matchup of backups may prove entertaining the falcons have been in disarray for some time and were crushed last week by carolina they will get no respite against jaguars quarterback blake bortles , who has rebounded from an nflhigh 55 sacks as a rookie \( which took away 345 yards \) to throw 30 touchdown passes and engineer a leagueleading four gamewinning drives in the fourth quarter barring injury , bortles should also easily top 4 , 000 passing yards the vikings have been hit hard by injuries to their defense , and it may not get any easier this week linval joseph , perhaps their most important defensive player , is likely to miss a third consecutive game the vikings will have their secondary s depth tested mightily last week , the vikings sent out multiple rookie cornerbacks and moved terence newman , a veteran corner , to safety they may get some players back this week , but the hits have kept coming with everson griffen , a defensive end who has eight and a half sacks , missing practice they may cobble together enough to beat chicago , but they need everyone back if they expect to be a true contender new england will play without its best running back , legarrette blount , who is out for the season with a hip injury julian edelman is still working his way back from a broken foot , rob gronkowski seemed limited last week in his return from a knee injury , and danny amendola , the healthiest of the patriots' main offensive options , has been limited in practice by a sore knee still , new england is favored by a jawdropping 15 points and was given an 895 percent chance of victory by espn s power index the chiefs are on the verge of an eighth consecutive win , but as of this writing they did not know which baltimore quarterback to prepare for matt schaub , jimmy clausen or ryan mallett the good news for kansas city is that none of them are hard to prepare for the chiefs are the first team to go 70 after a 15 start since the 1970 bengals , and while much of their success seems artificial , coming against weak opponents , the playoff tickets they will probably be printing will be real houston has never won in 13 trips to indianapolis if the texans break that streak , they will take sole possession of first place in the afc south , a division that is giving the nfc east a run for its money as the least impressive in the nfl it will be a matchup of backup quarterbacks , with t j yates starting for houston and indianapolis hoping that matt hasselbeck is ok to go , but possibly having to rely on charlie whitehurst the uncertainty makes the game hard to analyze , and it does not help that both teams have lost in consecutive weeks but houston seems more talented , so it may finally prevail on its division rival s home field the browns looked much improved on offense last week , and with the possibility that seattle will be without safety kam chancellor , they may have success going over the middle but with the way quarterback russell wilson has been playing recently , it does not seem as if anything can get in seattle s way he has been playing without marshawn lynch or jimmy graham , and will now be without thomas rawls , but somehow he keeps getting stronger if this is their last season in san diego , the chargers are going out with a whimper eliminated from the playoffs , they have doubledigit losses for the first time in quarterback philip rivers s career they may be playing their last game in the city this week , with a proposed move to los angeles looming , and while they have created many fond memories , it has been a while since they have added a new one miami is hardly a great team , but with a chance to finish with a 500 record , the dolphins at least have more to play for
seoul , south korea in a deal to defuse tensions on the divided korean peninsula that were rapidly escalating toward armed conflict , south korea agreed early on tuesday to switch off its propaganda loudspeakers on the border , while north korea agreed to stand down from its semiwar state , a high level of military alert north korea also expressed regrets for the maiming of two soldiers from the south in landmine explosions , kim kwanjin , the chief national security adviser to president park geunhye of south korea , said during a news conference mr kim also said that the two koreas agreed to hold reunions of koreans who became separated from relatives during the 195053 korean war such reunions , last held in february 2014 , are seen as a barometer of thawing relations south and north korea agreed to hold a government meeting in seoul or pyongyang at an early date so that they can have dialogue and negotiations on various issues to improve relations , mr kim said , reading a joint statement that the two countries signed at the border village of panmunjom the north korean government also announced the agreement on tuesday , which also included boosting exchanges between nongovernmental groups on the two countries the agreement emerged from marathon talks between mr kim and vice marshal hwang pyongso , the second most powerful military officer in the north after the country s leader , kim jongun the two sides haggled for three days at panmunjom while the rival military forces stood ready for a possible armed clash if the talks broke down northsouth relations , which were already testy , deteriorated sharply after two south korean border guards were seriously wounded on aug 4 by in retaliation , south korea resumed blaring propaganda into the north from along the border , reviving a tactic it had suspended 11 years ago the north , which had warned that it would consider use of the loudspeakers an act of war , said that if the south did not shut the speakers off by 5 pm saturday , it would take strong military action , including attacking the loudspeakers and an on thursday raised tensions further the two sides agreed to open talks to defuse the situation a few hours before the deadline on saturday the landmine episode loomed large in the dispute ms park insisted on monday that the south would not turn loudspeakers off unless the north apologized , while the north denied any responsibility the interkorean agreement on tuesday fell short of a clear apology ms park had called for she had said an apology was needed to break the repeated cycle of north korea s provocations north korea has never issued an apology worthy of the name , said lee sungyoon , a professor and north korea expert at tufts university s fletcher school of law and diplomacy , referring to deadly attacks on south koreans in the past unless south korea and the united states tighten sanctions and undermine mr kim s personality cult by infiltrating his isolated country with information , mr lee said , they will fall prey yet again to pyongyang s pattern of provocationnegotiationconcession and live with an evergrowing threat as the panmunjom talks stalled , north korea more artillery pieces , submarines and other forces along the border in an apparent move to increase its leverage the negotiators apparently broke their impasse with a compromise in which north korea expressed its regrets for the mine explosions without explicitly acknowledging responsibility for them south korea left open the possibility of restarting its loudspeakers if an abnormal case occurs in return for allowing that compromise , south korea won a north korean agreement to hold a new round of reunions of separated families in time for chuseok , the annual harvest holiday , which begins on sept 27 the holiday is traditionally a time for family gatherings in korea , akin to thanksgiving in the united states ms park has repeatedly called for more reunions of relatives who lost contact during the korean war six decades ago and have not seen one another since then over the decades , the two governments have arranged a series of reunions , but the program has proceeded only fitfully , subject to the political mood on the divided peninsula about 70 , 000 south koreans , most of them 80 or older , remain on a government waiting list , hoping for a chance before they die to meet children or siblings they left in the north eightythree south koreans and 88 north koreans had with relatives at a north korean mountain resort last february , but there have been none since then
in january , a week after the brutal charlie hebdo killings , the gleaming , modern philharmonie de paris , the new home of the orchestre de paris , with a gala concert and a weekend of free in a visionary yet risky attempt to entice new audiences to classical music , the complex is in northeast paris , near the ring road that separates the city center from its poorer , workingclass suburbs the free events drew thousands of people , including families with children , who waited in long lines to pass through heightened security checks for the chance to take in a concert or workshop recently i 've been thinking of that hopeful weekend , now that paris is again grappling with terrorism in a , i questioned the wisdom of conductors attempting to make a big statement through a cycle of the welltrod beethoven symphonies the composer s piano concertos are less encumbered with extramusical baggage and in a project he called the beethoven journey , the exceptional pianist leif ove andsnes played the five works in at carnegie hall in february with the mahler chamber orchestra , conducting from the keyboard and delivering scintillating and probing performances that had the integrated quality of fine chambermusic playing the excellent young pianist david kaplan , who loves schumann s quirky , wondrous davidsb ndlert nze , a set of miniature dances , asked 16 composer colleagues to write a piece riffing on one of the schumann dances or to create something new to be tucked into the suite in a in march at le poisson rouge , the greenwich village music club , mr kaplan played schumann s work and the new miniatures the result was delightful and substantive i admired the way he and the composers claimed this great schumann piece as their own why not \? seldom has an opera premiere generated such high expectations crossing , by the prodigiously talented composer matthew aucoin , who also wrote the libretto , tells of walt whitman s volunteer work treating wounded union soldiers during the civil war though not flawless , the opera , presented by the american repertory theater in boston in may and june , proved a taut , teeming and inspired work , with mr aucoin , just 25 at the time , conducting the ensemble a far cry thanks to a recording and dvd of katie mitchell s production of george benjamin s written on skin , it was already clear that this harrowing work , about a love triangle in the middle ages , is one of the first masterpieces of the 21st century lincoln center s mostly mozart festival to the david h koch theater in august with a riveting cast alan gilbert drew a surging and nuanced performance from the mahler chamber orchestra what seemed at first like it would be just another revival of this verdi favorite became instead a of personal courage and artistic dedication the charismatic russian baritone dmitri hvorostovsky , after announcing in june that he was undergoing treatments for a brain tumor and canceling his summer commitments , rallied himself for three met performances as the count di luna in trovatore in september and october he and looked elated to be onstage practicing his art the whole cast was inspired , especially anna netrebko as leonora , and the ovations were tumultuous the supremely expressive and intelligent british tenor mark padmore the three schubert song cycles die sch ne m llerin , schwanengesang and winterreise in october to open lincoln center s white light festival at alice tully hall as conceived by mr padmore and his distinguished accompanist , the fortepianist kristian bezuidenhout , this threeevening series came across as an overwhelming artistic whole i'm still waiting to see where andris nelsons , in his second season as music director of the boston symphony orchestra , intends to take the institution artistically but at carnegie hall in october , he certainly conducted a blazing of strauss s elektra , with an exceptional cast headed by the powerhouse soprano christine goerke , who simply owns the daunting title role if some of peter gelb s artistic decisions as general manager of the metropolitan opera have been questionable , his vision was best exemplified by a of berg s lulu in november here was an ingenious staging by the artist william kentridge of this wrenching work , one of the greatest 20thcentury operas , with a superb cast headed by the amazing marlis petersen , singing the title role , one of her signature parts , for the final time the adventurous young members of the danish string quartet play almost everything excitingly naturally , they bring exceptional insight and character to the four quartets of denmark s own carl nielsen in november , the ensemble for a lucky audience at the very intimate rose studio in lincoln center here , in chronological order , are the performances this year that most memorably provided what i'm seeking from and through music excitement , virtuosity , thoughtfulness , a sense of

in verdi s la traviata , then opened the company s 201516 season in september as an unusually headstrong desdemona in that composer s otello it has been a thrilling run at the met , only diana damrau and vittorio grigolo , scorching of massenet s manon in march , were as galvanizing this year it was a lucky stretch that gave me no fewer than four performances by this he was deathhaunted in schubert s winterreise at alice tully hall in february in wagner s tannh user at the berlin state opera in april poignantly reserved of monteverdi s orfeo at the bavarian state opera in munich in july and most intimately and perhaps best of all a heartrendingly subtle guide to longing in songs by haydn , beethoven , schoenberg and berg in november i wo n't soon forget i spent in a living room in princeton , nj , listening to a farewell sung to a portrait an extraordinary 1748 painting of johann sebastian bach that was soon headed to leipzig , germany , where it was made by a chance of history , the painting had hung in the childhood home of john eliot gardiner , the eminent bach conductor , and he led his monteverdi choir in two of the master s chorales to celebrate , later capping the day on the princeton campus with an exquisite performance of monteverdi s orfeo slyly moving , stravinsky s operatic masterpiece riffs on mozartean classicism with an energy and tenderness that presses it past pastiche the met s elegantly stylized production , originally directed by jonathan miller , is one of the company s strongest , and james levine long a champion of the work presided over a in may

inimitable nancarrow , the mad scientist of the player piano was given over to a sevenhour marathon performance of his dozens of studies for that instrument an encyclopedic exploration of the ways in which rhythms can collude and collide , it was exhausting and exhilarating spectrum , an intimate loft turned performance space on the lower east side , fosters a sense of immersion in the music being performed , an allin quality that was rewarded in to this british composer , born in 1959 featuring chamber works performed by members of the ensemble tilt brass in tendril , the sound made by rubbing a harp s strings was doubled by electronic strumming noises equale , suffused with the sounds of brass instruments , morosely ebbed and flowed it was an engrossing look at a searching artist in the

production , which wove together song cycles by berlioz and mahler into an affecting , excellently played and sung reflection on lost love even otto schenk s wellworn 1977 production took on emotional weight in the met s stirring , , in october , of a wagner opera often perceived as stolid peter mattei s apollonian smoothness and johan botha s courageous endurance are known qualities what was more surprising was the soprano evamaria westbroek her voice is n't placidly beautiful , but here it vibrated with a passion that suited this story of lust , guilt and transfiguration the orchestra shone under james levine , who paced the action with radiant sobriety a giddy wind blew this ensemble , based in los angeles , eastward for in october at roulette , part of the american composers orchestra s sonic festival boisterously theatrical and exuberantly talented , the group barnstormed its way through works written by its own members , and a couple of punkrock arrangements , too understated yet alert to drama , this british pianist did n't wallow in sentiment while in november at alice tully hall yet neither did he breeze through them instead , as he did several years ago in the same hall , he subtly destabilized these pieces , tugging and stretching their rhythms , transforming their melancholy into cosmic yearning and their consolations into discomfitingly direct joy this performance space in williamsburg , brooklyn , has been open only a few months but it already feels like an invaluable part of the new york music scene its highceilinged , attractive theater , with black walls covered in white panels that intersect in geometric patterns , has already hosted an array of uptown and downtown artists ren e fleming and theo bleckmann are among the disparate musicians on the calendar this month in october , i attended a memorable performance by , the a cappella octet admired for its imaginative vocalizing many groups specialize in a particular genre or aesthetic , but these musicians have demonstrated their technical and expressive versatility in an eclectic range of styles , from inuit throat singing to georgian sacred polyphony the group , whose members include the pulitzer prizewinning , has championed many young composers the lineup here showed them at their versatile best in a superb selection of works by missy mazzoli , ted hearne , eric dudley , william brittelle , caleb burhans and anna clyne , whose gorgeous , harmonically luxuriant pocket book viii , set to shakespeare s eighth sonnet , concluded the concert unlike most of the visitors accosted on an october morning in the blanche and al levine court in the modern and contemporary art wing of the metropolitan museum of art , i had a vague idea of what to expect when i was approached by someone dressed in black , draped with an exotic cloak , offering the gift of a song but that did n't detract from the experience , part of lee mingwei s installation in which a rotating cast of gifted young singers performed schubert songs for , and directly at , the individuals seated opposite them \( who , having been selected more or less at random , accepted the gift \) the performances were not private , exactly , since onlookers were free to crowd around and take it all in , but the setup made for a particularly intense , almost electric connection between singer and chosen listener , another manifestation of mr lee s concern in his recent works with human contact , communication and sharing as it happens , i was nabbed by one of the most charismatic of the singers , , a 27yearold bostonbased chinese soprano her beautiful rendition of schubert s nacht und tr ume was captivating , so much so that i returned a week later to hear her charm others and to savor afresh the originality and effectiveness of mr lee s concept this year , i heard the cellist matt haimovitz , engaged and saw a young orchestra as trains drove by musicians have long broken free of the concert hall , but too often there is little to tie the music they perform to the new spaces they choose sometimes , though , musician , music and location seem a perfect match as in april , when frederic rzewski , 77 , played his the people united will never be defeated ! the enormously complex set of piano variations on a chilean revolutionary song that he completed in 1975 at wholey s fish market in pittsburgh i was n't there , though a few are available online the idea of it still makes me smile a piece based on a people s anthem that enacts social togetherness in musical form , played not for the likes of me to ponder , but for people to hear as they went about their days after all , as mr rzewski told of the pittsburgh postgazette i did n't expect people to come who wanted to hear music i expected people to come who wanted to buy fish sometimes the performances that leave the deepest impressions are those marked by passion , drama and struggle s at the baryshnikov arts center in june had none of those qualities and yet her reading of bach s partita in d , its chaconne sparkling with freshness and grace , became one of the most memorable renderings of this towering masterwork of the violin repertory i have heard ms podger s warm , clean sound , stenciled phrasing and rhythmic vivacity in this program of works by bach , tartini and biber showed why she has become one of the leading performers on baroque violin just as lasting was the impression left by her relaxed stage presence more than once , she addressed the audience with a pitchperfect blend of information , selfdeprecating british humor and a shared sense of excitement that invited the listener into the unfolding wonder of the music amid the metaphysical ruminations of guardian angel , biber s eerie finale to his mystery sonatas , she directed a little smile at the audience , eyebrow raised amazing , is n't it \? she seemed to be asking it was it was not just the , or the and prokofiev , or the fact that an american orchestra was at the of the nation s rapprochement with cuba that made the minnesota orchestra s tour of havana in may a high point of the year it was also the way the quicklyputtogether tour signaled that the orchestra , which had been brought to the during a bitter 16month lockout that ended in 2014 , was back and was thinking big for all its immense talent and creativity , the classicalmusic field often seems consumed by financial struggles , , labor strife , handwringing over missions , and the havana tour was one of those hopeful moments this year like seeing to stage wagner , or a longforgotten harlem renaissance , or any number of shattering performances at the metropolitan opera or carnegie hall or lincoln center that offered a vivid reminder of what music aspires to those mojitos were pretty good , too more highlights from the year , as chosen by our critics , , , , , , , and
new delhi and his indian counterpart broke through a fiveyear impasse on sunday to pave the way for american companies to build nuclear power plants here as the two countries sought to transform a fraught geopolitical relationship into a fresh partnership for a new era of cooperation opening a threeday visit amid pomp and pageantry , mr obama moved to clear away old disputes that have stalled progress toward an alignment between the world s largest and most powerful democracies , a goal that has eluded the last three american presidents few obstacles to that have been more nettlesome in recent years than the deadlock over nuclear power today we achieved a breakthrough understanding on two issues that were holding up our ability to advance our civil nuclear cooperation , and we 're committed to moving towards full implementation , mr obama said at an appearance with prime minister at hyderabad house , the princely palace used by the government and this is an important step that shows how we can work together to elevate our relationship the details remained vague , and it was unclear whether the understanding would convince american companies , such as ge and westinghouse , to invest in s civilian nuclear development the companies had pressed to rewrite its liability law , which sunday s understanding did not call for , and so they will have to judge whether it is enough to resolve their legal concerns but the fact that both governments were willing to dispense with a dispute that has frustrated them since 2010 underscored the mutual desire to reinvent the relationship mr obama and mr modi also renewed a 10year defense pact , agreed to joint military hardware production and resolved to reduce the threat of greenhouse gas emissions to the world s climate the climate agreement included mostly minor initiatives , none of the scale of the deal that mr obama but american officials were encouraged that after years of disavowing responsibility to help curb emissions , mr modi told mr obama that was an article of faith for him and expressed determination to fight it the amity between the two leaders was palpable from the start as mr modi broke with protocol to greet mr obama at the airport with a warm handshake and hug during their later public appearance , mr modi referred to the president as barack and thanked him for his deep personal commitment to their friendship in a toast at a state dinner sunday evening , mr obama returned the favor , calling mr modi my partner and friend this new partnership will not happen overnight , mr obama said at the earlier appearance it s going to take time to build and some patience but it s clear from this visit that we have a new and perhaps unprecedented opportunity , and deepening our ties with india is going to remain a top foreign policy priority for my administration mr obama s visit , his second as president , is a major event in india despite lingering distrust over washington s history of support for rival pakistan , the united states enjoys widespread popularity here for weeks , the hindi news media has dissected details of mr obama s visit , running halfpage graphics of his limousine and airplane , broadcasting a detailed report about his blackberry and advising michelle obama on couture saris to wear mr obama s visit was marred by his decision and skip a tour of the taj mahal on tuesday to fly to saudi arabia to pay respects to the family of king abdullah , but that was quickly set aside as mr obama was welcomed with a red carpet , an honor guard and a 21gun salute he threw flowers on the memorial to mahatma gandhi at rajghat he and mr modi took a walk through a garden and shared tea and mr obama was announced by trumpets at the state dinner mr modi s reference to mr obama by his first name drew notice it s never been done before in india , to my knowledge , said baijayant panda , an indian lawmaker this is clearly sending signals to a lot of people , a lot of heads of government that matter still , the spectacle outweighed the substance in most cases on , india agreed to move to phase down hydrofluorocarbons , or hfcs , according to a treaty known as the montreal protocol but more broadly , india set no specific goals limiting greenhouse gases , as beijing did in november india is the thirdlargest carbon polluter behind the united states and china but has resisted bolder measures , citing its need to lift hundreds of millions out of poverty instead , the two sides agreed to promote solar , wind and other clean energy , and mr modi said he would support a global climate pact to be shaped in paris this year mr modi said he felt no pressure to match china s commitment itself is a huge pressure , he said global warming is a huge pressure the nuclear understanding may finally bring to fruition an agreement that president george w bush in 2006 to end a moratorium on sales of nuclear fuel and reactor components to india , stemming from its first nuclear test in 1974 the promise of a thriving new nuclear trade never materialized because of a 2010 indian law that would hold american companies liable for accidents in a way that they said went beyond an international convention , a delicate issue in a country still scarred by the bhopal chemical disaster 30 years ago obama aides said indian officials had provided reassurances that their liability law conformed to the international convention and that it should provide what one american official called extra security for foreign companies moreover , india indicated it would set up a governmentbacked insurance pool to cover some of the risk , but not all of it american officials said they had also worked out an understanding of how to track americanprovided nuclear materials , as required by law critics said it appeared mr obama had given in on the tracking requirement officials denied that , but details of both agreements were scarce , and they still needed to be translated before being signed westinghouse and ge hitachi nuclear energy , a partnership with a japanese industrial corporation , welcomed the agreement without declaring whether it offered enough protection in a statement , ge said the test would be whether it brings india into compliance with the international convention of supplementary compensation , a global liability accord westinghouse praised the progress toward resolving issues that will enable westinghouse and other us companies to participate in india s growing nuclear energy market daniel roderick , the chief executive of westinghouse , is in new delhi to attend a business leaders' meeting with mr obama on monday , but it was not known whether he had been consulted some analysts said the understanding sounded vague and inconclusive it s a deal on principles rather than specifics , which as far as i'm concerned is not a deal at all , said abhijit iyermitra , a security analyst at the observer research foundation in new delhi a lot of it s just , you know , blowing the trumpet sujatha singh , india s foreign secretary , insisted that was not true let me underline we have reached an understanding , she said the deal is done c raja mohan , another analyst at the observer research foundation , said it showed mr modi s determination to resolve issues with the united states the traditional reluctance to be seen with the americans is over
in the twilight of his presidency , george w bush sought refuge in one of his foreign policy victories africa dogged by his global missteps and failures , mr bush traveled abroad in feb 2008 to trumpet his legacybuilding aids program when president heads to africa later this week , the focus wo n't be on a signature success story instead , the trip will highlight his lack of attention to the continent i was working for the united states agency for international development when mr bush arrived in rwanda to much fanfare he deserved the warm welcome and praise for his administration s aids program more than 15 billion dedicated to preventing and treating the disease mr bush s effort helped change the conversation from if the epidemic could be contained to how the number of people in subsaharan africa receiving antiretroviral drugs went from under 100 , 000 to 2 million such a defining accomplishment has proved elusive for mr obama and is unlikely before his term is up this is a major disappointment for many africa watchers , but it does n't mean the president should n't become more active across the continent in the time he has left mr obama has initiated some laudable policies the administration did a good job of anticipating and preparing for turmoil in burundi following president pierre nkurunziza s decision to run for a third term despite a twoterm limit the situation there continues to unfold and the country stands on the brink of chaos , but the obama administration s allocation of resources for preventing violence there have been significant the united states also played an active role in helping the parties avert the worst in the central african republic s deadly sectarian civil war and the american military s intervention in west africa to provide order and logistical support to the response did more to help curb the crisis than is often acknowledged mr obama s power africa initiative to increase access to electricity is the type of program that could pay big dividends in the future but none of these initiatives scratches the surface of what s possible for the united states mr obama has been mostly missing in africa the opportunity to look past the horizon has been missed washington s thinking on africa is outdated , feckless and held back by the quest to stop terrorism today instead of reducing its likelihood tomorrow and for a long time to come it s easy to make the case that the geopolitical importance of africa paled in comparison to other concerns on mr obama s watch how could the president devote time and political capital to the area when he has n't even been able to effectively extract america from the middle east and pivot to asia \? this may be a good argument , but it s also shortsighted the future of american policy toward africa needs to be less about aid and more about trade less about unholy security partnerships and more about relationships with regular people and less about turning a blind eye to the transgressions of allies and more about getting tough on democratic failings mr obama has little time left , but he can kickstart the changes that are necessary two areas stand out first , the president can bring more attention to major conflicts and increase pressure on human rights violators the civil war in south sudan where a power struggle , massive displacement of people and risk of famine threaten to tear the world s newest nation apart is a good place to start the obama administration has n't ignored the issue , but it could be more active in regional diplomacy and push harder with targeted sanctions to compel compromise by both sides second , and closely related , mr obama should turn away from corrupt , ineffectual leaders and build ties directly with their embattled constituents he should choose his friends wisely cozying up to nasty regimes or staying silent in the face of abuses has n't worked in the past it just kicks the problems down the road and often creates new ones the next generation of citizens , and leaders who defend democracy and protect rights , are the ones to establish connections with , the second stop on mr obama s trip after , is an example of a country with repressive leaders who are being rewarded for their counterterrorism support instead of backslapping security partners in addis ababa , mr obama should publicly criticize their efforts to quash internal debate and dissent he should stand with the people not the leaders by speaking in support of human rights and opposition leaders nigeria , despite its imperfections , would have been a better country to visit , following its democratic transfer of power this year it was a surprisingly fair and peaceful election and the first time an opposition candidate won the vote over the incumbent if there was ever a time to visit , it is now countries across the continent are developing and changing quickly and in unique ways with growing populations and expanding markets , there are huge opportunities for trade and investment but , for better or worse , united states policy in the region has often been characterized by aid development funds and projects have shaped relations this should also change as economics and business opportunities overtake aid in importance unlike his predecessor , mr obama will not be on a victory lap in africa his administration has n't done enough to drive american policy in the region forward but if he lays out a strategic vision and starts with these modest steps , the united states will finally be on the right track
maren mjelde , right , scored on a free kick in the 61st minute to help norway tie topranked germany , 11 , in ottawa anja mittag put germany ahead in the sixth minute , chipping in a rebound lisi wang scored in stoppage time in the second half to lift china to a 10 win over the netherlands in edmonton thanatta chawong scored in the 75th minute , a goal that proved to be the winner in thailand s 32 victory over ivory coast in ottawa canada , the host , managed just a 00 tie against new zealand in edmonton canada remained on top of group a , but has only one goal in two games after allowing an early goal , ingrid hjelmseth made seven saves to help norway withstand a potent german attack the germans had 27 shots \( eight on goal \) while norway had just four pia sundhage , the former united states coach who is now with her native sweden , spent a portion of her news conference thursday discussing comments she made in a , some of which were seen as critical she explained some of her comments but also reiterated some points , referring to goalkeeper hope solo as a piece of work but also as the best goalkeeper in the world none of the american players responded directly to sundhage s comments , instead giving her mostly pleasant reviews she really brings the best out in players , midfielder tobin heath said , because she s so positive and encouraging the united states will play its most anticipated match of the group stage on friday , against sweden and coach pia sundhage , who led the americans from 2008 to 2012 after a surprising 33 draw with nigeria , the swedes will most likely be feeling some pressure to earn a victory cameroon , which opened with a 60 victory over ecuador , has a much more difficult test against japan , the defending champion
washington if the new congress can agree on anything this year , it may well be the transpacific partnership , a trade deal between the united states and 11 other countries throughout the asiapacific region passions run high when it comes to trade deals these days , and the obama administration is working hard to sell it to labor unions , which roundly oppose it so far the pitch has been about what the deal , as written , will do to help the american economy a pitch that has n't won over many , on either side of the partisan divide but there s one thing the administration can do that will both win over some opponents and address one of the biggest issues in global trade add a chapter on currency manipulation it is not unusual for countries to manage their exchange rate the value of their currency relative to others to make their exports cheap while making others' exports to them more expensive this method has been used extensively by , among others , china , japan , malaysia and singapore aside from china , all signatories to the partnership the american dollar is a prime target for these currency managers first , the dollar is the global trading system s premier reserve currency , meaning dollars are freely traded and confidently accepted by international investors and americans are a highly acquisitive people a nice way of saying we buy a lot of stuff consumer spending as a share of gross domestic product is about 70 percent here , 55 percent in europe and 35 percent in china we 're steady customers for exportled economies there s nothing wrong with that , until these exporters start buying dollars to raise the value of the dollar relative to their own currencies , thus subsidizing their exports and taxing their imports in the united states , the result is persistent trade deficits that have been a drag on growth and jobs betterthanaverage manufacturing jobs for decades in a compelling argument for including a chapter in the transpacific partnership to restrict currency manipulation , c fred bergsten of the peterson institute for international economics that america s trade deficit has averaged 200 billion to 500 billion per year higher as a result of the manipulation by the rest of the world , resulting in the loss of one million to five million jobs the challenge is in the details countries buy foreign currencies for various reasons , not just to gain a trade advantage , and they should n't necessarily be held to account for doing so moreover , opponents of such a chapter argue that it would cover the actions of our own central bank , the federal reserve , and open it to charges that it also manipulates exchange rates \( when the fed lowers the shortterm interest rate , or engages in quantitative easing to lower longerterm rates , one clear consequence is to lower the value of the dollar \) but that argument does n't quite hold it s a matter of intent , and there is a clear test whether the central bank is engaging in domestic demand management or currency management , and the simplest way to tell is to observe whether the bank is buying foreign currencies the people s bank of china does a great deal of that our fed does almost none it s important to recognize that deals like the transpacific partnership are not necessarily about free trade they are instead a set of rules some , like lowering tariffs , lead to freer trade , while others , like expanding patent protections , are more protectionist rules governing currency tactics certainly fit the framework some purchasing of foreign currency should be fine under the transpacific partnership some developing economies collect dollars to cover their external debts in case of financial crises and large outflows of private capital with this in mind , mr bergsten suggests that holding enough foreign currency to cover a year s worth of external liabilities might be a sound benchmark anything more would be questionable once we 've agreed on what currency management looks like , what actions would a chapter on it take \? these could include a tax on the imports of offending countries , fines , the temporary canceling of certain trade privileges and my favorite , if countries can go into currency markets and buy dollars , then we must be able to do the same with their currency that s not currently possible with china and other countries , which use capital controls to block such large purchases speaking of china , even though it s not part of the partnership talks , rules like these , especially reciprocity , should be applied to it as well not to do so would put the signatory countries at a distinct disadvantage to a trade behemoth with a history of undervaluing its currency to maintain trade surpluses as a white house economist in the first few years of the obama administration , i learned that many of my colleagues shared my concerns about currency management but all administrations believe the only way to do something about it is through quiet diplomacy they believe that writing down rules in a trade agreement is too risky , with the potential to scuttle the whole deal diplomacy has n't worked a more direct approach is needed if the trade deal s supporters want an agreement worthy of broad support , this is a chance they ca n't afford to miss
in the command centers of republican presidential campaigns , aides have drawn comfort from the belief that s dominance in the polls is a political summer fling , like herman cain in 2011 an unsustainable boomlet dependent on megawatt celebrity , narrow appeal and unreliable surveys of americans with a spotty record of actually voting in primaries a growing body of evidence suggests that may be wishful thinking a review of public polling , extensive interviews with a host of his supporters in two states and a new private survey that tracks voting records all point to the conclusion that mr trump has built a broad , demographically and ideologically diverse coalition , constructed around personality , not substance , that bridges demographic and political divides in doing so , he has effectively insulated himself from the consequences of startling statements that might instantly doom rival candidates in poll after poll of republicans , mr trump leads among women , despite having used terms like fat pigs and disgusting animals to denigrate some of them he leads among evangelical christians , despite saying he had never had a reason to ask god for forgiveness he leads among moderates and collegeeducated voters , despite a populist and antiimmigrant message thought to resonate most with conservatives and lessaffluent voters he leads among the most frequent , likely voters , even though his appeal is greatest among those with little history of voting the unusual character of mr trump s coalition by no means guarantees his campaign will survive until next year s primaries , let alone beyond the diversity of his coalition could even be its undoing , if his previous support for liberal policies and donations to democrats , for example , undermine his support among conservatives and in the end , the polling suggests , mr trump will run into a wall most republicans do not support his candidacy and seem unlikely ever to do so even now , more say they definitely would not vote for him than say they support him but the is surprising at a time of religious , ideological and geographic divisions in the republican party it suggests he has the potential to outdo the flashinthepan candidacies that roiled the last few republican nominating contests and it hints at the problem facing his competitors and the growing pressure on them to confront him , as several , like jeb bush and scott walker , are starting to do his support is not tethered to a single issue or sentiment immigration , economic anxiety or an antiestablishment mood those factors may have created conditions for his candidacy to thrive , but his personality , celebrity and boldness , not merely his populism and policy stances , have let him take advantage of them tellingly , when asked to explain support for mr trump in their own words , voters of varying backgrounds used much the same language , calling him ballsy and saying they admired that he tells it like it is and relished how he is n't politically correct trumpism , the data and interviews suggest , is an attitude , not an ideology for voters like jan mannarino , a 65yearold retired teacher who drove an hour from her home in green oak township , mich , to see mr trump this month , his defiance of political norms is his single greatest virtue even if he does n't win , he s teaching other politicians to stop being politicians , ms mannarino said he comes on strong he could say it gently but i think no one would listen when people talk about the qualities mr trump would bring to the white house , they describe the raging , merciless executive who fired people for sport on television some mention trips to his golf courses , which they admiringly note are impeccably run a common refrain he s a person who gets things done that he has no experience in government is not a liability , many say , but rather one of the main reasons they want him in washington we do n't need a politician for president we need a businessman , said tom krzyminski , 66 , a hairstylist from bay city , mich that s what we need to get us out of the mess we 're in a new york times review of nine nonpartisan national polls and more public surveys in the early nominating states shows that , thus far , mr trump is outperforming his republican rivals with constituencies they were widely expected to dominate for example , he leads senator ted cruz of texas , a hero to fiscal conservatives , among supporters , 26 percent to 13 percent , according to averages of the last nine national polls he leads former gov mike huckabee of arkansas , a former preacher , among evangelicals , 21 percent to 12 percent and he is ahead of mr bush , the former florida governor and a favorite of mainstream donors , among moderate republicans , 22 percent to 16 percent national polls , and both public and partisan pollsters , have struggled to unravel the precise sources of mr trump s support , leaving many to ascribe it to anger and angst in the republican electorate but interviews with voters highlight the degree to which his popularity hinges on personality and offer an answer to an enduring mystery why have n't mr trump s outrageous statements , his lack of loyalty to the republican party and his caustic attacks on rivals hurt his standing \? his most offensive utterances have , for many republicans , confirmed his status as a unique outsider willing to challenge conventions , and satisfied a craving for plainspoken directness asked if mr trump had crossed a line with his language , carl tomanelli , 68 , a retired new york city police officer in londonderry , nh , seemed surprised by the question people are starting to see , i believe , that all this political correctness is garbage , he said i think he s echoing what a lot of people feel and say many say they support mr trump because of his unusual statements , not in spite of them lisa carey , 51 , of greenfield , nh , immediately cited mr trump s outspokenness when asked why his support remains so high as inappropriate as some of his comments are , i think it s stuff that a lot of people are thinking but afraid to say , she said and i'm a woman asked if they think his brashness would make it more difficult for him to work effectively as president , many voters argue the opposite i want people who are negotiating with him to believe my president when he says he s going to do something , said lori szostkiewicz , 54 , an educator from hampstead , nh i want to negotiate from a position of strength , not weakness in interviews with voters in michigan and new hampshire over the past two weeks , after events hosted by mr trump , none cited his policies as chief motivation for backing him many pointed , instead , to his wealth , saying they believed it set him apart from career politicians and freed him of the demands of donors he does n't need anybody s money , said maureen colcord , 60 , a clinical dietitian from derry even as dozens of national and state polls have charted mr trump s steady ascent , republican campaigns have taken solace in their conviction that those surveys are flawed and misleading in interviews , campaign pollsters argue that such polls , conducted largely by media organizations and universities , rely on feedback from many republicans who are unlikely to vote because the polls do not verify the party registration or voting history of respondents a fact that those conducting the surveys concede new data provided to the times by civis analytics , a firm aligned with democrats and founded by the former chief analytics officer of the obama reelection campaign , shows that there is merit to those concerns , but not enough to call mr trump s lead into question curious about the republican primary landscape , the firm decided to see what it could learn from its own survey , at first for internal research purposes unlike most public polls , civis s relied on a list of registered voters that included their voting histories , allowing it to measure mr trump s support among those who regularly cast ballots in primary elections the survey , which was conducted on landlines aug 10 through wednesday and has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus four percentage points , showed mr trump s support at 16 percent among registered voters who identified as republicans that tally is less than any public poll in more than a month , but still more than any other candidate ben carson was at 11 percent , and mr bush at 10 percent a poll weighted to reflect the characteristics of the adult population , like most conducted for national media organizations , would have shown mr trump faring some two points better than the civis data , which was adjusted to reflect the characteristics of registered voters who identify as republicans the survey included 757 republicanleaning respondents , considerably more than other polls of the republican presidential field in reality his real support is less than what we see in the polling today , said masahiko aida , lead survey scientist for civis the civis poll also hinted at a potential problem for mr trump states that allow only registered republicans to participate in nominating contests , including iowa and nevada he was at 14 percent among registered republicans in the states with party registration , compared to 18 percent of the voters who were unaffiliated with a party as expected , mr trump performed best among lessfrequent voters he had the support of 22 percent of republicanleaning adults who did not vote in the 2012 general election but he still held an edge , with 15 percent , among registered republicans who had voted in a primary since 2008 whether the person voted in two or eight or 12 elections , trump leads , mr aida said his falloff in support when infrequent voters were sifted out was not unique support for some of mr trump s rivals , including mr bush and mr carson , declined by similar amounts , or even more , among the most frequent voters , civis found mr trump s strength among lessfrequent voters is a challenge for his campaign , which may lack the organizing experience and infrastructure to motivate them and turn them out in large numbers for a primary or caucus but those irregular voters , like norman kasmikha , 41 , a grocer from shelby township , mich , represent a real opportunity for the republican party , which is determined to retake the white house in 2016 after losing the last two campaigns right now i do n't have a second choice , mr kasmikha said they all blend in to me it s donald trump and everyone else my second choice , he added , might be staying at home
port st lucie , fla in the notsodistant future , the will probably be relying on several pitchers who have had tommy john surgery three of them are young starters matt harvey , jacob degrom and steven matz the other two are relievers who have served as the mets' closer jenrry mejia and bobby parnell on sunday morning , another key met announced that he would have the operation the team s top lefthanded reliever , with a 132 earned run average in 47 appearances last season said he would miss the 2015 season that puts the mets in a bind they would like to have at least one lefty in their bullpen , and none of the four other candidates have pitched particularly well this spring the team was also awaiting the results of a magnetic resonance imaging test on starting pitcher zack wheeler s right elbow wheeler had told the mets that his right elbow felt tender he experienced something similar last season and pitched well afterward , but being cautious , the mets had him skip a start and had his elbow examined again as of sunday afternoon , no announcement had been made about the results edgin had taken a few days and sought a second opinion from dr james andrews , an orthopedic surgeon , before deciding to have the operation edgin s case seemed somewhat unusual his ligament was not simply torn doctors told him that he had a bone chip inside the ligament and that it was rubbing on his flexor tendon a future injury to that tendon was likely , and it would have been more consequential than having tommy john surgery now in the greater scheme of things , this was the best option , edgin , 28 , said he is expected to have the operation in the next few days , and he could possibly return by opening day next year in the meantime , the mets will look for a reliable lefthanded replacement the four candidates in their camp , , and have a combined 1093 era this spring we 'll continue to look at all options , general manager said we know what we have internally at this point we 'll hope that those options improve over the next couple of weeks , become more attractive , and we 'll continue to look externally as well as for wheeler , it may be premature for the mets to plan on not having him he said saturday that he had experienced elbow tenderness throughout his career and had pitched through it even though the problem flared up last year , the mets have said it did not affect how he was handled wheeler had two mri exams over the offseason , too , and both came back clean , the mets have said alderson characterized the soreness as a condition that the team simply had to monitor and manage , unless it intensified we just have to see how the symptoms manifest themselves and whether they continue , alderson said if they continue at a low level , if they continue at a more intense level , that s all part of the equation but , you know , zack s a tough guy if wheeler misses more than one spring training start , dillon gee could slide into the rotation the mets tried trading gee over the offseason , and when they came to camp with six starters , he was working as a reliever now he is scheduled to start on thursday but alderson said the plan had nothing to do with wheeler s elbow gee just needed to throw more innings to prepare for the season this possibility , or a possibility of something like it , is probably a reason we 've been hesitant to trade pitching in general , alderson said this is what happens with pitching you see guys going down all over the place i think it s why we 've been hesitant to trade any of our pitching depth
washington representative alma adams , a freshman democrat from north carolina , set a record the moment she took the oath of office after winning election in november , she was sworn in immediately to fill a vacant seat , and for the first time in history , there were 100 women in congress perhaps none , however , has had as unlikely a path as ms adams , who has a phd in art education , a collection of about 900 hats and an upfromthebootstraps story to tell she taught art at the historically black bennett college in greensboro , nc , and spent 20 years in the north carolina legislature before coming to congress from the 12th district she spoke about her \( rather poignant \) past in this interview , which has been edited and condensed you are 68 , an age when many americans are retiring why run for congress now \? i 've worked all my life and i 've served all my life , and i still felt as if i had a lot to offer i had done 40 years at the college it was time for me what prompted you to pursue a life in education \? i had a very strong mom growing up she s 89 now my mother did domestic work she cleaned people s houses she did that because she knew that it was important for me not to do it my mother always said , you 've got to go to college i got married in sophomore year i would n't advise that , but i 've got two wonderful children and four wonderful grandchildren we were married 13 , 14 years then i went back to get my master s i was the only africanamerican woman at that time in the art education department at ohio state tell me a little about growing up i grew up in new jersey in newark and east orange , montclair i had a sister who was two years older my sister had sickle cell anemia , and she lived for 26 years , almost until her 27th birthday my mother had to go to work every day , so i would have to get up sometimes at 2 , 3 o'clock in the morning to go with her to take my sister to the emergency room , because that s how we got our care i started working at 13 for a seamstress in montclair she taught me how to sew i kind of grew up with responsibilities , helping caring for folks , and that s what i had to do i met my father for the very first time when i was 15 years old , and that s an interesting story i hope i will have a chance to write about i never knew him my mother raised us pretty much by herself she had her own feelings about that but i got to know my father , and i actually got to love him i met him on the street in montclair he just pulled up and was inquiring on my sister i remember it was a sunday afternoon we would go to the movies on sunday , and we were just walking and he asked me if i knew linda shealey that s my sister s name and i said well , maybe i might who are you \? and that s when he told me he was her father and i said she s my fullblooded sister if you 're her father , you must be mine it was very surreal , but that s the way it happened what lessons do you draw from that \? as i told students when i spoke at bennett college in january , where you start out in life does n't have to determine where you end up or how far you can go what got you started in politics \? when jesse jackson ran for president in 1988 , i helped organize his presidential campaign here in greensboro , in guilford county when people came and asked me to do that , i kind of thought they were crazy i said , i do n't know anything about politics and then i ran for school board , and i was the first africanamerican woman to be elected to the school board , and it was a turbulent two years i was on the campus of bennett college , and people knew me as a professor and not as a rabblerouser , but i was labeled that way because i brought attention to a lot of discrepancies in our school system i was very outspoken about it and the newspapers painted me when they would write , they would say , alma adams , the militant black professor from bennett college why was i called the militant parent when other parents who do n't look like me are called concerned \?

kabul , afghanistan with s fractious coalition government already struggling , a new deadline looms that could further hurt its credibility the afghan parliament s term is set to expire on sunday , with no elections scheduled and no agreement on how to hold them as a lastditch measure , president ashraf ghani s office issued a decree on friday to extend parliament s term in a statement , his office said parliament will continue its work until elections could be held , and that a date for those elections would be announced within a month but some critics said the move was unconstitutional it was unclear whether the extension decree would satisfy international donors , who had earlier said they for new elections because of the impasse an overhaul of the electoral process in time to elect a new parliament was a central element of the powersharing deal , brokered by the united states , between mr ghani and his rival in last year s disputed presidential vote , abdullah abdullah the agreement nominally ended a political crisis that some feared could and mr abdullah joined the government with the largely undefined title of chief executive but in the 10 months since the government took office , conciliation between mr ghani and mr abdullah has been hard to find , officials say the government has struggled even to permanently fill key positions like defense minister , attorney general and chief justice of the supreme court even with parliament now extended temporarily , there is still no branch of the afghan government whose legitimacy has not been clouded in some way at the outset of the new government , first our executive power lost its legitimacy , because it is formed based on a socalled political agreement , said gul rahman qazi , a law professor who was chairman of the constitutional oversight commission in the previous administration besides that , we are witnessing that the judiciary s power is being run by an acting head that entirely has no legitimate reference in the constitutional law , either as a final point , we have our legislative power , whose term will end both mr ghani s and mr abdullah s camps agree that no elections should be held until the process is overhauled they disagree on how to proceed , and even on who should oversee the overhaul that has led officials on both sides , as well as other afghan and western officials , to suggest that the electoral issue will pose the biggest challenge that the fragile governmental partnership has yet faced adding to concern is that mr abdullah s extraconstitutional role as chief executive also has an expiration date his agreement with mr ghani called for the constitution to be amended within two years through a loya jirga , or grand council of elders according to the constitution , that jirga cannot be held until after elections for parliament and for district councils , whose members make up a large portion of the jirga the question is n't just whether we will be facing a vacuum of legitimacy , said zekria barakzai , the director general of democracy watch , a civil society group the question is , how long are we going to continue with this trend of destabilizing elections \? ' mr abdullah and mr ghani did not even begin serious discussions on the issue until march , six months after the government was inaugurated when they did meet , they could not agree on who would head an electoral reform commission mr ghani drew criticism for nominating one of his more vocal campaign allies , the lawmaker shukria barakzai , for the post mr abdullah immediately rejected her ms barakzai has since taken her bitterness over the episode to parliament during a televised session , she questioned the legality of mr abdullah s post as chief executive in the ensuing furor , an abdullah supporter and member of parliament , hafiz mansour , shouted at another lawmaker , i will smash your face one of the thorniest issues is the fate of the officials who oversaw the contested 2014 presidential vote , which cost international donors nearly and was denounced by the monitors said all sides were to blame , but mr ghani was thought by many to have benefited the most from irregularities mr abdullah says no elections can be held until the fate of those election officials is decided but none of the election officials have been charged with any crime , and they cannot easily be removed from office mahmoud saikal , a senior adviser to mr abdullah , said his camp would not stop short of unveiling the faces behind the huge fraud in 2014 for both leaders , the discussions are charged claims of victimhood mr abdullah s aides have said the 2014 election was stolen from him mr ghani s advisers have complained of bullies in the abdullah camp , who forced them to accept the coalition government agreement by threatening unrest
new orleans lawyers for abortion clinics squared off with texas state attorneys in a federal appeals court here on wednesday , arguing over the constitutionality of that would force more than half the remaining abortion providers in texas to close but more is at stake than whether large portions of south and west texas will be left with no abortion clinics , , for safety reasons that doctors and clinic owners call a pretense the case argued here along with others arising from the hundreds of adopted by in recent years poses issues that are likely to end up before the in the next year or two , many legal experts say , with the potential for significant effects on the ability of women to obtain abortions in much of the country the core question raised by the texas case and others is where the constitutional boundaries lie , as antiabortion forces , unable to ban the procedure outright , seek to use clinic regulations to raise costs and limit access rulings \( stemming from roe v wade , a 1973 decision \) have held that women have a right to an abortion until the fetus is viable , usually around 22 weeks after conception but the court has allowed states to impose restrictions on abortion provided that they do not present an undue burden the case argued here before the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit involves the most farreaching provision of the antiabortion law adopted by texas in 2013 , a requirement that all facilities , even those performing simpler , earlystage abortions and nonsurgical medicinal abortions , meet the costly construction , equipment and staffing standards of ambulatory surgery centers no waivers were granted for longstanding clinics with good safety records obstacles to abortion , if the law takes effect , would fall particularly on hispanic and lowincome women , the clinic owners say how many clinics do you have to close before the court says , enough' \? asked b jessie hill , a law professor at case western reserve university who is not involved in the case can you leave a state the size of texas with only seven clinics \? would that be an undue burden \? she asked , referring to the illdefined limit on abortion regulations set by the supreme court in 1992 , and at the center of several court cases in a spirited hearing that went past its allotted time , a panel of three judges , including two who upheld texas abortion restrictions in previous actions , questioned whether many of the new requirements would improve patient care but they also criticized a lower court for voiding the entire surgerycenter law , rather than specifying which parts were justified and which were not from the questioning , it appeared possible that the appeals court would send the case back to the district court in texas that blocked the surgerycenter requirement last fall , requiring it to parse the rules more finely rather than voiding the law wholesale if , on the other hand , the appeals court , which is known as conservative , upholds the law , the clinic owners are almost certain to appeal to the supreme court clashing court decisions on other issues such as mandatory ultrasounds and counseling messages , and requirements for doctors to have admitting privileges at local hospitals could also reach the supreme court , experts say as the constitutional issues percolate in courts across the country , antiabortion groups , buoyed by republican gains in the november elections , say they will pursue more restrictions in dozens of states this year if highimpact measures like the texas surgerycenter rule are ultimately declared legal , then state disparities in the availability of abortion could widen even more on the other side , advocates for abortion rights have won some important legal battles in the last year , including a decision by the fifth circuit preventing the closing of mississippi s only abortion clinic it s an ongoing national question , whether women will have meaningful access to abortion across the country , or only in a subset of states , said suzanne b goldberg , director of the center for gender and sexuality law at columbia law school the texas surgerycenter rule has already taken a dizzying path through the courts last , judge lee yeakel of the federal district court in austin blocked the measure , saying it would affect some women drastically and would not bring significant medical benefits he also partly lifted another disputed requirement , that doctors have admitting privileges at local hospitals , for two clinics in isolated locations , mcallen and el paso the state appealed to the fifth circuit , arguing , as it did again wednesday , that the legislature should decide whether a law protected health , that abortion providers could choose to build more surgery centers and that since at least 83 percent of the population would still live within 150 miles of a clinic , the undue burden standard had not been violated on , the appeals court lifted judge yeakel s stay of the law , causing all but eight abortion centers , none of them west of san antonio , to close \( an earlier appeals court ruling , upholding the state s requirement that doctors have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital , had already helped cause the number of abortion clinics to decline to fewer than 20 , from 41 \) but then on , the supreme court reinstated the injunction against the law , allowing clinics to reopen pending the further consideration that started with wednesday s hearing the panel hearing the case wednesday , picked by lottery , included jennifer w elrod and catharina haynes , appointees of president george w bush who previously voted to uphold parts of the texas abortion law , and edward c prado , who was also appointed by mr bush to the surprise of many in the courtroom , the two conservative female judges aggressively challenged the texas solicitor general , jonathan f mitchell , asking whether many of the new building requirements made medical sense and whether it might be dangerous to force women to drive hundreds of miles home after an abortion it seems like we 'll have women driving a long way and suddenly have a bleeding episode , judge haynes said is n't this the antithesis of what the state is trying to achieve \? the judges also pressed the lawyer for the clinics , stephanie toti of the center for reproductive rights she argued that there was no rational basis for the new regulations because they will actually increase the risks that women face but the judges said that the clinics had failed to show that a large fraction of texas women would live too far from abortion clinics and asked why the courts should not demand more limited changes in the law one way or another , many legal experts say , a major new abortion case is likely to reach the supreme court in the next year or two , most likely involving a single state law and issue beyond the case argued wednesday , which provides a stark test of the undue burden standard , several other abortion cases are in the judicial pipeline , including some with directly clashing decisions from federal appeals courts last month , the court of appeals for the fourth circuit , in richmond , va , a north carolina law that required women to undergo ultrasounds as the doctor described the fetus whether the patients wanted to hear it or not and offered scientifically disputed advice on the safety of abortions the north carolina attorney general has promised to appeal the decision because it contradicts , he argues , a 2012 decision by the fifth circuit , upholding a similar ultrasound and patient counseling law in texas state requirements that abortion clinic doctors have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals are also percolating in the courts , and federal appeals courts have issued divergent rulings on state laws restricting the use of medication abortions ultrasound , admitting privileges , ambulatory surgery centers i think that by next term at least one of these issues will be before the supreme court , said ms goldberg , of columbia law
many exhibitions are good , some are great and a very few are tantamount to works of art in their own right for their clarity , lyricism and accumulative wisdom the museum of modern art s staggering is in the third category large , ambitious and unavoidably , dizzyingly peripatetic , this is a onceinalifetime event it sustains its vision through a ring of 11 grand spaces on the museum s fourth floor , tracing the serial genrebending forays into three dimensions wrought by this 20thcentury titan of painting each bout lasted a few years and was different from the one before , and each has been given its own gallery , more or less with one stunning exception the voluptuous saturnine the women in picasso s life do n't herald stylistic changes in the round as they tend to on canvas in sculpture , the materials become the muses the show , which opens on monday , is the latest in a string of landmark pablo picasso exhibitions for which the modern has been justly famous since 1939 it is full of loans that perhaps only this museum has the clout to secure , including about 50 pieces from its collaborator , the mus e picasso in paris the approximately 140 sculptures here were made between 1902 and 1964 encompass at least 10 media among them wood , plaster , sheet metal , clay , beachsmoothed pebbles and , in assemblage , all manner of found objects great and small the galleries are dotted with works never before exhibited in new york , and reunite related efforts not seen together since they were in picasso s studio the show s two grandest , most thrilling reunions are the gathering in its second gallery of all six glass of absinthe sculptures of 1914 , those tiny weirdly keatonesque charmers of painted bronze that can suggest drunken faces and profiles and in its fourth , the five monumental tumescent heads in white plaster of marieth r se , more than have ever been shown together , at least in the united states seen from the vantage point of the absinthe glasses , the first marieth r se bust looms in the distance , as if at the end of a garden high points aside , there has n't been a picasso sculpture survey of this scope in this country since 1967 that s when the first large exhibition of sculpture that picasso ever permitted reached the modern after incarnations in london and paris he kept his sculptures close , like family , and none closer than the great plasters , which were apparently absent from the '67 presentation he lived among great jumbles of them from the 1930s on , as attested by the photographs that brassai took in the artist s studios between 1932 and 1945 two dozen brassai images line a small gallery here , adding to the show s ricocheting crossreferences and insights like its predecessor , this exhibition raises the question of whether picasso was a better sculptor or painter it s a tough call in each medium , he disrupted art with a trackswitching masterpiece in painting there is the vehement demoiselles d'avignon of 1907 , on view in the fifthfloor galleries , one of the central pylons on which he and braque erected cubism and he did art perhaps an even greater favor with the boxy constructed wall piece guitar a 1914 work that initiates modern sculpture by establishing space itself hollowness , volume , weightlessness as one of its primary materials picasso was more completely himself in three dimensions a magician , a magpie genius , a comedic entertainer and a tinkerer with superb reflexes his many gifts versatility , voraciousness , a need for constant reinvention are more sharply apparent in real space and tangible materials we ca n't miss his consummate grasp of tactility and form or of the potential for found objects and materials to lead double lives screws could be legs of a girl reading a book a spigot could be the crest of a crane whose body and tail feathers were once the head of a shovel a small flatfaced deity carved from a scrap of wood is reddened and rubbed until it looks like ancient terra cotta with the exception of cast bronze , which he seems not to have cared for , picasso never met a material he could n't subdue , exalt and transform at the same time , nor come across an idea in other art whether ancient or contemporary that he could not use there s no wasted motion , not an extra grain of matter , just a supreme economy even pedestrian pieces have redeeming aspects the inexplicably beloved bronze man with a lamb of 1943 may strike you as the best ever , or maybe a monument to , but the big clumsy hands with which the man grasps the struggling creature are extraordinary and , in fact , picasso mastered bronze when he personalized it by painting it , as he had with the absinthe glasses that s just one way he brought painting with him to sculpture in the show s eighth gallery , covering 1945 to 1953 , he paints with glaze on ceramic vessels in the shape of figures and animals , on bronze casts of assemblages , including the shovelbacked crane , and on a woman and toddler cobbled together from flimsy scraps of lumber that might be a work by an outsider artist here also , he makes monstrous assemblage flowers for a ceramic pot and a watering can from wood , metal and crockery shards ingeniously stuck together with plaster and painted their bristling energy and yellow colors suggest a homage to van gogh s sunflowers and then , in the same time span , he goes tiny and smooth , incising stunning little faces on impeccably chosen beach pebbles , outkleeing paul klee with a little cycladic thrown in for good measure picasso s constant motion is much more apparent , and maybe more fruitful , in sculpture in the show s opening gallery , which covers 1902 to 1909 , we see him first in capable thrall to gauguin with a pintsize unfired clay rendering of an old seated woman , whose sensitive face is clearer in a brassai photograph later in the show but soon come the double jolts of iberian and african sculpture , evidenced by a scary little wood idol , carved from what once seems to have been a table leg painted green its furious black eyes are the heads of tiny screws he also always cut his losses in this first gallery , the 1909 bronze head of a woman is powerful as ever , but also more clearly one of the great dead ends in early modernism a futile attempt to bring the flickering facets of analytical cubism , and c zanne into three dimensions the future of sculpture lay with braque s innovation , cubist collage goaded by african art , picasso then arrived at the groundbreaking guitar by coaxing collage s flat clean shapes into three dimensions this mirage of hovering planes , voids and shadows in sheets of cutout , darkly rusted ferrous iron is simultaneously a mask , a body and a musical instrument in addition to breaking open sculptural space , it made selfevident structure almost de rigueur next to it hangs its crucial dry run , an exact but radiant replica in creamy paper and paperboard they preside over the absinthe glass bronzes like proud parents all these works the guitars , the glasses pointed toward abstraction , but again picasso moved on , leaving it to others to develop almost every sculpture he ever made during the rest of his long life was a recognizable thing , usually a living one , whether human or animal as this show proves , it was as if having irrevocably altered sculpture with the guitars he then set out to reveal all the ways to depict the figure that remained to be explored and yet the guitars in particular haunt many of these efforts their hollowness is implicit in the great vegetal shapes of the plaster busts of marieth r se walter , who looks dominant and alert in sculpture as she rarely does on canvas , and who might be given braquelike billing as collaborator the guitars' planar composition is explicit in the protoinstallation piece the bathers , whose six flattened sentinels picasso made in 1956 , using more decrepit lumber and the occasional ingeniously placed open frames the planes and weightlessness recombine in the faces and figures and one wizardly chair formed from bent and painted sheet metal in the show s final gallery some of these works are mostly white others served as tensile canvases for color , most notably , woman with hat , a popout reprise of a frequent picasso motif a woman in an armchair all of them seem ready to take flight over the modern s garden just beyond the window picasso sculpture has been wrested into being by ann temkin , chief curator , and anne umland , curator , both in the modern s department of painting and sculpture , and virginie perdrisot , the mus e picasso s curator of sculpture and ceramics we are in their debt each gallery of this brilliantly installed effort is an exhibition unto itself , full of subtle links , allusions and contrasts that tie the works together or hold them apart the last gallery delivers you back to the entrance and the circular path a great chain of being in art is fitting picasso s sculptural progress was nonlinear , and , anyway , one s impulse is to keep circling through , taking in more and more with each rotation this is one of the best exhibitions you 'll ever see at the museum of modern art , especially in its current iteration the fourthfloor galleries , which usually house the permanent collection , postwar division , have never looked better the show s spacious installation every piece \( save wall pieces \) can be seen in the round redeems at least this part of the museum s soulkilling 2004 expansion it also suggests that too many works on display may mean that people look less , because they move faster and more obliviously if the modern s curators can reinstall fewer works after the close of this show ,

the dalai lama , who may be the only octogenarian spiritual leader with a profoundly mischievous streak , has a suggestion for china s communist leaders take up reincarnation i'm interviewing him in his hotel room in manhattan , at the end of an overseas tour , and we 're talking about what happens after he dies he is the 14th dalai lama , each considered a reincarnation of the previous one , and usually after one has died a search is undertaken for an infant to become the next but he has said that he may be the last of the line , or that the next dalai lama or might even be a girl this talk infuriates beijing , which is determined to choose the next dalai lama \( to use as a tool to control tibet \) so , startlingly , the atheists in the chinese communist party have been insisting that buddhist reincarnation must continue the chinese communist party is pretending that they know more about the reincarnation system than the dalai lama , said the dalai lama , laughing the chinese communists should accept the concept of rebirth then they should recognize the reincarnation of chairman mao zedong , then deng xiaoping then they have the right to involve themselves in the dalai lama s reincarnation the dalai lama hinted that he would hold some kind of referendum among tibetan exiles , and consultations among tibetans within china , about whether a new dalai lama should succeed him the issue will be , he said one reason to end the line , he suggested , is that a future dalai lama might be naughty and diminish the position his biggest concern seems to be that after he dies , china will select a new pet dalai lama who may act as a quisling to help the chinese control tibet and to give legitimacy to their policies there sadly , the precedent has been set , he said , referring to the panchen lama , the second most important reincarnated lama in tibetan buddhism after the , china kidnapped the baby chosen by tibetans as his successor and helped anoint a different child as the 11th panchen lama nobody knows what happened to the real panchen lama i admire the dalai lama enormously , and in 2007 he bravely used to send an important olive branch to beijing only to be criticized by fellow tibetans as too conciliatory , and rejected as insincere by china but i told him that i also thought there were times when he had been too cautious and had missed opportunities for rapprochement with beijing my examples in the 1980s , when the leaders hu yaobang and zhao ziyang sought compromise on tibet after the 10th panchen lama died and in the runup to the beijing olympics the dalai lama was having none of that he does n't think he missed opportunities but he acknowledged that zhao had been sympathetic and added that if zhao and hu had not been ousted , the tibetan issue would already be solved , no question to my surprise , the dalai lama was also enthusiastic about xi jinping , the current chinese leader he spoke admiringly of xi s anticorruption campaign , said xi s mother was very religious , a very devout buddhist , and noted xi himself had spoken positively of buddhism so , president xi , if you 're reading this , the dalai lama would like to visit china how about an invitation \? i had asked my followers and to suggest questions for the dalai lama , and here are his responses to some of the issues they raised  as he has before , the dalai lama strongly condemned the violence he added if buddha would come at that moment , he definitely would save or protect those muslims the dalai lama said he had been a pure vegetarian for 20 months but then developed jaundice , so his doctors told him to start eating meat again he now eats meat twice a week and is vegetarian the rest of the week , he said , but added that he thinks vegetarianism is preferable i admire his stance , the dalai lama said he dismissed one german bishop for too luxurious living i was so impressed i wrote a letter to him i expressed my admiration the dalai lama says he considers himself a feminist and would like to see more women leaders because he thinks women are often innately more sensitive and peaceful i insist that women should carry a more active role , he said if eventually most of the leaders of different nations are female , maybe we 'll be safer
senator of vermont says he will not attack in harshly negative ways but pollsters for his campaign are quietly testing pointed critiques of mrs clinton as too close to wall street or as unreliably liberal for initially supporting trade deals and the iraq war mr sanders says he wants to avoid becoming a typical politician , yet he did n't exactly break the mold on pbs s charlie rose on monday night if people are satisfied with establishment politics , you 've got a candidate , he said of his leading opponent for the democratic presidential nomination if you want real change , i'm the candidate the next morning , mr sanders framed mrs clinton as a johnnycomelately on policy priorities for liberals i am delighted that in the last couple months , hillary clinton has come on board positions that i have held for many , many years , he said on nbc s today after weeks of inching toward a more aggressive posture against mrs clinton , mr sanders is now walking a fine line he is trying to draw sharp contrasts between their records , yet not attack her on a personal level he questions her political shifts on the oil pipeline , the pacific rim free trade deal and rights , for instance , while trying to avoid impugning her honesty and judgment , a favorite republican tactic his aim , advisers say , is to peel away more lowerincome democrats , liberal women and others from mrs clinton s base of support in earlyvoting states like new hampshire and iowa , where he is counting on victories to create momentum elsewhere defeating mrs clinton without resorting to nasty attacks may be the most difficult challenge yet for mr sanders as he tries to prove that his campaign which is racing to grow and evolve as fast as it must can compete at the same high level as mrs clinton s vaunted political operation but to raise doubts about her could also undermine what many voters like about mr sanders that he says he abhors the ugly side of politics and will avoid it even if it costs him the campaign already , some sanders supporters say that although they agree he needs to draw contrasts with mrs clinton , they fear that he could jeopardize his allabouttheissues image his greatest strength is his authenticity as a different kind of leader , said pramila jayapal , a washington state senator who is a prominent sanders supporter in seattle denigrating mrs clinton as a purveyor of establishment politics struck ms jayapal as namecalling , and she said , i 'd prefer what he 'd been doing before pointing out the real , specific problems facing the country and in politics today another sanders supporter , state senator richard segerblom of nevada , said it was one thing to draw contrasts , but to get in the mud with hillary clinton is not a winning strategy at all for sanders , because his message is that he is different from her according to sanders campaign advisers , mr sanders and his political strategists decided together that he would start criticizing mrs clinton by name and making detailed contrasts between his record and hers two tactics he rarely employed until recently mr sanders wanted to fight back against what he saw as the first negative attack of the campaign , when mrs clinton twisted his remark about people shouting in support of tougher gun laws \( mrs clinton has called for new gun control legislation mr sanders has endorsed background checks for gun buyers but also cited the difficulty of passing major new legislation \) at the democratic jeffersonjackson dinner in iowa on saturday , mrs clinton alluded to women being accused of shouting when they actually are n't an indirect suggestion that mr sanders was guilty of sexism , which his campaign denounced as unfair mrs clinton has also singled out some of his congressional votes on gun control to suggest that he is not as reliable on the issue as she would be tad devine , a senior adviser to mr sanders , warned of more to come if mrs clinton s campaign keeps taking senator sanders s words and positions out of context if they start going further down that negative road , i think we 're going to start looking at whether or not she can really tell the big banks to reform when so much of her money comes from wall street , mr devine said that would be step 1 step 2 would be you go to goldman sachs and give a speech for an hour and get 200 , 000 and you are going to be able to stand up to the banks \? mr devine said there was a line between drawing sharp contrasts and going negative , and voters give you a lot of leeway when you are drawing contrasts on issues that they care about , like breaking up the big banks you 'll never see us going after her negatively , like with a tv ad that uses her face and systematically attacks and undermines her in a personal way , he continued she can go as negative as she wants , but that s just not who bernie is a spokeswoman for mrs clinton said mr sanders was the one going negative her campaign has been about how to make a difference in american families' lives a cause she s fought for her entire life , said the spokeswoman , christina reynolds it s a shame senator sanders s campaign has decided to make the campaign about political attacks voters want to hear about how their candidate will fight for them , not fight each other mr sanders s own speech at the dinner struck some in the audience as too focused on comparing his positions and his campaign with mrs clinton s i think when an unconventional candidate starts using conventional strategies , there s a dissonance to that message , said jeff link , a veteran democratic operative i think there s a real risk to that one clinton supporter , former gov howard dean of vermont , whose 2004 presidential run is often compared to mr sanders s , said that mr sanders faced the difficulty of modifying his message to try to attract clinton supporters and undecided democrats instead of just pleasing his own liberal base that was the big problem that i had and in fact it s the reason i did n't win , mr dean said yes , he does have to make that turn , and it s very hard to do it s hard to make changes in the middle of a campaign mr devine scoffed at the notion that mr sanders was having growing pains , noting that mr sanders had run tough campaigns before he said the campaign was taking the necessary steps to compete against a tough opponent , including conducting polling to test mrs clinton s vulnerabilities he declined to go into details , but other operatives said the polling dealt with mrs clinton s shifting positions on issues and ties to wealthy and corporate interests mr devine said he thought such political polls did not constitute a harsh , negative maneuver that ran afoul of mr sanders s pledge to focus on the issues we have to be prepared , and frankly we also need to do research on senator sanders to understand which attacks could really hurt us and which attacks could be answered pretty quickly , said mr devine , who is now finalizing campaign commercials that will start on television soon none of those ads will mention her or make contrasts , by the way bernie has and always will hate negative ads

today in syria i told press i'm horrified by total disregard for civilian life by all parties in this conflict http tco l7xaysnp5g
when i was a young economist trying to build a career , i lived or thought i lived in a world in which ideas and those who championed them met in relatively open intellectual combat of course there were people who clung to their prejudices , of course style sometimes trumped substance but i believed that by and large better ideas tended to prevail if your model of trade flows or exchange rate fluctuations tracked the data better than someone else s , or resolved puzzles that other models couldn t , you could expect it to be taken up by many if not most researchers in the field this is still true in much of economics , i believe but in the areas that matter most given the state of the world , it s not true at all people who declared back in 2009 that keynesianism was nonsense and that monetary expansion would inevitably cause runaway inflation are still saying exactly the same thing after six years of quiescent inflation and overwhelming evidence that austerity affects economies exactly the way keynesians said it would and we re not just talking about cranks without credentials we re talking about founders of the shadow open market committee and nobel laureates obviously this isn t just a story about economics it covers everything from climate science and evolution to bill o reilly s personal history but that in itself is telling academic economics , which still has pretenses of being an arena of open intellectual inquiry , appears to be deeply infected with politicization so what should those of us who really wanted to be part of what we thought this enterprise was about do \? that s the question brad delong has been asking i see three choices 1 continue to write and speak as if we were still having a genuine intellectual dialogue , in the hope that politeness and persistence will make the pretense come true i think that s one way to understand olivier blanchard s now somewhat infamous 2008 paper on the state of macro he was , you could argue , trying to appeal to the better angels of freshwater nature the trouble with this strategy , however , is that it can end up legitimizing work that doesn t deserve respect and there is also a tendency to let your own work get distorted as you try to find common ground where none exists 2 point out the wrongness , but quietly and politely this has the virtue of being honest , and useful to anyone who reads it but nobody will 3 point out the wrongness in ways designed to grab readers attention with ridicule where appropriate , with snark , and with names attached this will get read it will get you some devoted followers , and a lot of bitter enemies one thing it won t do , however , is change any of those closed minds so is there a reason i go for door 3 , other than simply telling the truth and having some fun while i m at it \? yes because the point is not to convince rick santelli or allan meltzer that they are wrong , which is never going to happen it is , instead , to deter other parties from false equivalence inflation cultists can t be moved but reporters and editors who tend to put out viewsdifferonshapeofplanet stories because they think it s safe can be , sometimes , deterred if you show that they are lending credence to charlatans and this in turn can gradually move the terms of discussion , possibly even pushing the nonsense out of the overton window and the inflationcult story is , i think , a prime example yes , you still get coverage treating both sides as equivalent but not nearly as consistently as in the past when paul hyperinflationinthehamptons singer complains about the krugmanization of the media , who have the impudence to point out that the inflation he and his friends kept predicting never materialized , that s a sign that we re getting somewhere it really would be nice not having to do things this way but that s the world we live in and , as i said , there s some compensation in the fact that one can have a bit of fun doing it
in a bid to silence critics who claim that his two wins were products of either conventional or socalled mechanical doping , chris froome on thursday released results of several physiological tests that demonstrated he was in top physical condition but the unconventional nature of the release in in the british edition of esquire magazine and the tests , which were arranged by his wife , may mean that froome , the leader of team sky , will still face questions about his performances as with the disgraced american rider lance armstrong , froome s sometimes during the tours of 2015 and 2013 , when he first won , drew doping allegations they escalated in the middle of this year s tour when antoine vayer , a french cycling coach , physical education teacher and antidoping gadfly , leaked physical race data from froome online while those numbers were far from conclusive , vayer suggested that the power output produced by froome could only be explained by the assistance of a secret electric motor hidden inside the british rider s bicycle while no one has been caught using mechanical doping , bikes are sometimes inspected for motors professional cyclists are data collection machines in addition to speed and distance , other devices record heart rate and power output while some riders regularly post that information online , froome s team has resisted doing so , although it did make available the results from one of this year s tour stages vayer and others also called on froome to release a rating of his maximum aerobic capacity , a figure more commonly known as vo max at the time , froome said he did not know the number because he had not undergone a test to determine it for several years rob jorgensen , a spokesman for team sky , said the new tests , which were conducted at a sports medicine lab in london owned by the british drug maker glaxosmithkline , and their release had nothing to do with the team according to the article in esquire , they were arranged by froome s wife , michelle , and conducted during the summer on two key measures , froome produced exceptionally high results adjusted for his weight during the 2015 tour de france , froome s vo max was 882 according to the lab , it measures 34 to 40 for most people the magazine also published the results of tests on froome made in 2007 , when he weighed more , a factor which would decrease the count that test set his maximum aerobic capacity at 802 charlie rose , a spokesman for the , said that none of the scientists involved in the test were available for interviews he added that the lab planned to submit the results in a peerreviewed journal , but that both the journal and the timing of any paper had yet to be determined phillip bell , one of the scientists who measured froome , told esquire that froome s values are close to what we believe are the upper limits for vo peak in humans jeroen swart , a south african sports physician interviewed by esquire , said that the relative consistency between the recent test and the one from 2007 , when froome was not a leading cyclist and weighed about 17 pounds more , suggests that froome s rise to the top was natural the engine was there all along , swart told the magazine he just lost the fat in the tests , froome also produced exceptionally high levels of power his maximum output was 525 watts , or 751 watts for each kilogram of his weight , what swart called a massive figure froome was able to produce a sustained power level of 419 watts or 625 watts per kilogram , also a very large figure according to vayer s scale for analyzing riders' performances , both figures would be suspicious , but swart told the magazine that he rejected that assessment on thursday before the results had been released , vayer dismissed the tests , calling them advertising he followed the rules lance , did too , vayer said what are the rules \? not be caught it s their rules not pure sport rules sky did not make froome or anyone from the team available for comment after the article s publication during an interview with the magazine , froome seemed weary about the need to dispute the doping allegations i can understand where the questions are coming from , he is quoted as saying questions do need to be asked as long as the questions are fair , i'm happy to answer them what gets my back up is when those questions turn into straightforward accusations he added i know my results will stand the test of time , that 10 , 15 years down the line people wo n't say , ah , so that was his secret' there is n't a secret
wellington , new zealand when new zealand coach steve hansen suggested in the middle of the six nations that rugby was in danger of becoming boring with its showcase world cup just months away , most people would have agreed with him up until the final weekend of europe s premier tournament , the games were lacking in both excitement and tries it took a chaotic super saturday , when the six nations championship was decided on the final day on points differential , to bring the teams into life wales , ireland , england and france knew they needed to score tries to win the trophy , and none held back a total of 27 tries were scored in a 221point blitz across the three matches ireland ended up as champion the six nations has resisted adding bonus points for scoring four tries or more in a game , something done in both the major southern hemisphere competitions super rugby and the rugby championship if the six nations did embrace the concept of extra points for scoring tries , then the freeflowing , attacking rugby seen regularly in the southern hemisphere could become a staple in the north hansen , whose all blacks team will defend its world cup title in england later this year , may have made his comments to stoke the flames before the cup he is a coach who is not afraid to use mind games to unsettle opponents but he did have a point fans will not want to watch endless kickandchase tactics or scrum resets at the world cup they will want to be entertained the final round of the six nations showed that a usually more conservative team like ireland and to a lesser extent england and wales can turn on the creativity when it has to , but more often it chooses the safer route new zealand , australia and increasingly south africa are more ambitious on attack and prefer to play more with the ball in hand or take a more aggressive approach with their kicking games hansen also said that getting a positive attitude from coaches and players was critical to ensuring that the messier aspects of rugby the breakdown after a player is tackled and the scrums were cleaned up by that he meant that teams needed to stop looking at using negative tactics , often involving rule infractions , to get an advantage in those two areas at the breakdown , those tactics include entering a ruck when players of both teams are contesting for ball possession after a tackle from an offside position or a player leaving his feet to illegally slow the attacking team in many situations , kicking becomes the first option , because it is safer than giving away a penalty or losing possession while trying to run the ball back at the opposition but it is also less entertaining scrums continue to be a major issue at every level of the professional game , particularly as teams try various tactics to induce opponents to commit penalties shenanigans during scrums have been a blight in super rugby so far this season , with the endless collapsed scrums and resets leaving players , fans and coaches frustrated referees have resorted to sending prop forwards to the sin bin for 10 minutes for repeated infringements , but quite often the player being punished is the wrong one that was the case in the crusaderscheetahs game on march 21 when cheetahs tighthead prop coenie oosthuizen was yellowcarded after a series of collapsed scrums , when in fact it was the crusaders loosehead prop , wyatt crockett , who should have been penalized tom coventry , assistant coach of the new zealand team the chiefs , said it comes down to players' doing their jobs legally instead of testing the referee s limits by not pushing straight or binding correctly in the scrum i think for the benefit of our game , the players need to buy in to what the referees are trying to do , coventry said if you start yellowcarding players you 're invariably going to start sending players off and you 're going to weaken your scrum and you 're going to get less opportunities to play i'm like everyone else , he said i want the game to start quickly , but i also understand how important it is for a side to be able dominate at scrumtime , and if you have dominance , you want to exert that constantly rugby s governing body , world rugby , said it would review the rules and could run trials of new ones after the world cup echoing hansen s comments , steve tew , the chief executive of the new zealand rugby union , said that there was a growing frustration on the overemphasis on defense and that the breakdown was too confusing the breakdown is clearly the area we are focused on because there is a lack of clarity for the fans and for the players because they often look up when the whistle goes and are never quite sure who will be penalized , tew said but tew acknowledged that there was no simple solution and that the contest for the ball after the tackle remained a crucial part of the game i would n't say we 're satisfied with the breakdown , but we are satisfied it needs to remain part of our sport , he said
jalalabad , afghanistan parveena almost got away she was on her way home from a visit to her parents in a remote corner of eastern with her children by her side and a small group of women two men , their faces covered by kaffiyehs , pulled up on a motor scooter who is parveena , daughter of sardar \? said one , looking at the group of women , their faces hidden behind blue burqas no one answered one of the men took his kalashnikov and used the muzzle to lift the burqa of the nearest woman in conservative afghan society , a gesture akin to undressing her in public it was parveena , who like many afghans used only one name she grabbed the muzzle , according to her father and her brother , and said , who is asking \? but the gunmen had seen her face , and they fired 11 bullets into her parveena s story she was one of six policewomen killed in 2013 is an extreme case , but it reflects the dangers and difficulties of afghan policewomen and the broader western effort to engineer gender equality in afghanistan the plight of women under the captured the western imagination , and their liberation became a rallying cry a flood of money and programs poured into afghanistan , for girls' schools and women s shelters and television shows , all aimed at elevating women s status but these good intentions often foundered against the strength of afghan sexual conservatism as the tale of afghan policewomen shows , repressive views of women were not just a taliban curse , but also a deeply embedded part of society now , as western troops and money flow out of afghanistan , the question is just how much the encounter with the west and its values has really changed the country , and whether any of the foreign ideas about the status of women took hold in 2001 , when the taliban regime fell , women in afghanistan were among the very worst off on earth they had no access to education , women s health care was scant , and governmentsanctioned public beatings were widely accepted women rarely ventured out at all , and when they did , they had to be accompanied by a man and covered head to toe with a burqa fourteen years later , there is a palpable sense of possibility for women , especially in urban areas girls are going to school in large numbers , at least up to age 11 , and there is more access to women s health care even in some remote parts of the country however , in rural areas and in the pashtundominated east and south , most women still live confined lives they are subjected often to forced marriage , child marriage and beatings , and sometimes to honor killings and conditions for afghan women over all still rank close to the bottom among developing countries hiring and training policewomen have been key priorities of western governments and funders they reasoned that afghan women and girls , who face high levels of violence , sometimes on a daily basis , would be more likely to report abuse or seek help if they could turn to other women , and that meant ensuring there were women on the police force but those hopes ran up against the sexual taboos that haunt every interaction between men and women in afghanistan policewomen have been branded as little more than prostitutes , dishonoring their families that stigma means that mostly desperate women , usually illiterate and poor , have joined the force in a society where coercive sex is a frequent tool , many endure sexual harassment for fear of losing their jobs afghan policewomen , struggling to maintain good reputations , face a legion of logistical problems poorly understood by western donors a need for separate changing rooms in police stations , for example , since women are afraid to wear their uniforms on their way to work after a decade and millions of dollars , even the modest goal of recruiting 5 , 000 policewomen remains a mirage in fact , only 2 , 700 are on the force , less than 2 percent of the 169 , 000 members , according to the united nations' office in kabul based on numbers from the afghan interior ministry the situation in afghanistan is not prepared for women to work with men , and our community is not ready for female police to work here , said col ali aziz ahmad mirakai , who heads recruitment for conservative nangarhar province , where parveena worked colonel mirakai , who supports having more policewomen , sighed the police commanders i work with say we do n't need them to work with us until noon and go home instead of female police , send us male police' he said , alluding to the reality that many women have to leave work early to care for their families to assemble a portrait of policewomen s experiences , the new york times interviewed more than 60 policewomen , male police commanders , interior ministry officials , western military officials and staff members of nongovernmental organizations a united nations report given to the ministry in 2013 but never publicly released in part because of fears of possible reprisals against policewomen found that 70 percent of the 130 policewomen interviewed had experienced sexual harassment , with smaller numbers reporting rape or more explicit pressures to have sex the interior ministry s and afghan society s generally negative view of policewomen , the lack of a confidential complaints mechanism , corruption , lack of facilities , discrimination and sexual harassment remain primary barriers , said georgette gagnon , the head of the united nations' human rights division in afghanistan the clash between western ideals and afghan realities means a program established to promote women has all too often backfired , subjecting the recruits themselves to abuse and retribution the small but real achievements have been in some of the familyresponse units , which give female victims a chance to talk to a policewoman and gain access to female lawyers it s the absurdity of imposing our liberal western beliefs , said a western diplomat who has spent many years in afghanistan and asked not to be named because of the sensitivity of the subject for governments that have invested heavily in training afghan women for the security forces it s easy for us to put these women out there and tout their accomplishments , but then we leave , cut them loose , and what happens to them \? like all the women who work with her in kabul police district no10 , sharifa aziza is too frightened to wear her uniform outside the office she does not want her neighbors to know she is a policewoman unlike most of her colleagues who stay inside a rickety trailer working as searchers and patting down women who enter the police compound , ms aziza works in the familyresponse unit and occasionally helps with criminal cases she counts herself lucky that she is subjected less to the harassment of younger male police officers , who bother the female searchers almost constantly one spring day , the windows of the female searchers' small trailer were open and a policeman kept poking his head in , saying kiss me to a young female colleague of ms aziza i have told him no , ' the young woman said forcefully i will not leave until i bite your face , he said in a tone that was meant to be playful but that had an edge to it the woman looked at the floor there is no effective confidential complaint system when policewomen are harassed senior police officials could not remember any complaints from women that had been formally prosecuted , and they minimized the problem some women are pressured into giving in good women are pushed into doing bad things , said madina , 21 , a policewoman in eastern afghanistan who would allow only her first name to be used to protect her safety ms aziza s boss , nooria sediqi , a second lieutenant who is about 50 , displayed considerable knowledge of prostitution arrangements within the police the salaries are low , she said of police pay for a session of sex , a woman could earn 100 or even 200 , she said that is half a month s salary for a junior policewoman , and a great deal even for a more senior one occasionally older policewomen have acted as madams , procuring younger ones either for men within the police force or outside it , according to two of the policewomen interviewed for this article as well as western officials who work with the police interviews suggest that many policewomen , aware they have few useful skills and untrained in how to behave professionally , are vulnerable to sexual pressure they are easy targets for more senior males who can withhold their pay or assign them to jobs far from home , and so policewomen are fearful of complaining ten years ago , ms aziza followed two of her brothers who had joined the security forces and enlisted with the police , hoping to earn enough to help sustain her family in those early years of president hamid karzai s administration , afghanistan was full of promise women in cities had begun to take off their burqas and there was a widespread sense of a new start it seemed to me then a very good and clean job , she said then her husband died of cancer and she had to take in the wife and children of her brother , who is a drug addict even though she earns twice as much as cleaners for the education ministry , her 240 monthly salary is nowhere near enough after paying 100 for rent and as much as 80 for electricity , there is rarely more than 60 left for food , medicine and clothing this is the room of a widow woman , ms aziza said , gesturing to the dark tworoom hovel where she lives on an abandoned construction site outside , a broken bedspring sat between torn bags of cement , a promise of construction that was never realized the sharp smells of urine and sour milk pervaded the house it was a friday , her day off , and she flung open her sole cupboard to show her prized possessions her crisply pressed police uniform was draped in plastic to keep out the relentless dust she showed certificates for attending police seminars , describing which dignitaries presided over each ceremony then she rummaged until she found a picture of a pretty 8yearold girl smiling into the camera my daughter , she said here , when a woman is widowed , she has to marry her husband s brother and i refused , she said it was a moment of independence , but it quickly turned tragic her motherinlaw , concluding that ms aziza must be morally lacking when she turned down a chance to be respectable , took the child from her while afghan law allows a widow to have custody of her children , as a practical matter the lack of money often results in the children staying with relatives ms aziza sees her daughter now only once a year , on her birthday she took my daughter by force , said ms aziza , staring into the photo as if the girl might walk out of it and into her arms tears came to her eyes embarrassed , she looked away soon it would be time to make dinner and there was not much other than some bread left from the morning and a bag of okra ms aziza s family obligations are common among women in the police force , and often limit what they can accomplish on the job they have to look after their children , cook , make dinner , clean they have to leave early to take care of family matters , said col ali akbar mahmoudi , the former police chief in ms aziza s district , who is a supporter of policewomen none of the women police are coming during the night just in some exceptional cases when we send them a police vehicle to pick them up for a raid the men , by contrast , he said , are flexible , they work all jobs , 24 hours they pull guard at night in fact , many of the women said they had been left to make their own way home after raids and only recently had been given separate toilets and changing rooms ms aziza s day starts in the dark hours before dawn when she rises to make tea before setting out at 6 30 am for work , which begins at 8 usually she takes a series of minibuses , squeezing into vehicles so packed with people that they are in danger of tipping over the need for transportation for women in a society where respectable women do not go out of their homes alone was one of the many details that escaped western organizations that gave money for women s empowerment , said anastasiya hozyainova , who worked as a consultant to the united nations and the european union the policewomen do n't receive transportation help , for instance , so how can a woman even get to work \? she said under pressure by western funders to meet gender targets , police officials hired any woman who would sign up but there were few recruits in the countryside col saboor khan , who until 2014 was the longtime deputy for gender , children s rights and human rights at the interior ministry , said that in traditional afghan culture , it s a shame for a woman to work , and that also reflects on the family ms aziza works in the gender and family response unit of district 10 , a section that exists at least nominally in every police department in afghanistan to deal with domestic violence but many women are not allowed to leave the house except with a male relative , and often that relative is either the person who was beating her or someone in the family allied with him and even if a battered woman is able to get away , there is a profound shame associated with talking about such matters to someone outside the family even other women the result is that 12 years later , there are still relatively few cases for the units of the 13 policewomen in the 318member force in district 10 , most are searchers one , feriba , stood in the trailer s small entry , looking out at the scrawny shrubs in the yard her salary supports a disabled husband and six children do you think we want to do this \? she asked i would do anything else , she said , answering her own question ms aziza nonetheless believes that district 10 is better than most both the former interior minister , umar daudzai , and the new one , nur alhaq ulumi , have tried to push commanders to find jobs more suitable for women they listen to women more here , ms aziza said in the past year , at least they gave us a separate toilet maybe they received much pressure from the world community and that has created pressure to take care of the women , she said early in 2014 , when there were still substantial numbers of american and nato troops in afghanistan but i am worried , she said after 2014 , what should we do \? zarif shaan naibi is that rare figure among afghan policewomen a success story the first female warden of kabul s women s prison , she stands out among the overwhelmingly male command structure of the interior ministry her realm is a barren patch of ground on the northeast side of kabul with the threestory prison at its center six days a week ms naibi goes to her office in a building next to the prison , and after attending meetings and signing paperwork , she wades into the prison itself once painted white , the prison building is now badly scuffed , and the female prisoners seem to pour out of it the prison has been overcrowded for years at the end of 2014 , it housed 33 percent more women than the 120 it was supposed to hold , according to prison officials the women jostle to lean out of the windows and crowd at the front door , but there is nowhere to go other than the small bare yard , where even weeds seem to have a hard time growing before she even reaches the stairwell , ms naibi is besieged by women asking her for medical care , to arrange lawyers' visits , or for help settling disputes a woman of medium height with hair either swept under a police cap or under a neat hijab , ms naibi neither puts on airs nor appears particularly dominating , but her sense of purpose is unmistakable she steadily navigates the prison s maelstrom of emotion , keeping herself at arm s length she relies on her rare ability to create privacy for conversations she pats one inmate on the arm and then does the same to another , a gesture that is at once maternal and admonishing she asks them to hug each other and makes them promise to stop fighting her success appears to be rooted partly in her training in the late 1970s and the 1980s , when afghanistan s government was imbued with communist ideology the period offered exceptional opportunity for women , especially in urban areas as ethnic hazaras , a group that was persecuted by the taliban and has now embraced education and the modern world , ms naibi s mother and brothers allowed her to join the police , and when she married , her husband allowed her to continue he is now in the defense ministry ms naibi recalls that in her day all her teachers at the police training center were women now they are almost all men under the communists , women s education was valued and candidates for the police were vetted , she said if she was n't educated , they would n't take her if she had graduated from high school , they would send her to the police academy but these communist ideals encountered resistance from much of afghan society then under the taliban , most policewomen were banished , and ms naibi s family , as hazaras , had to flee when the police were reconstituted after the taliban s ouster in 2001 , the afghan leadership was desperate for women to serve , calling former policewomen back to work as well as recruiting new ones for ms naibi , it was a second birth when the ministry put out the word , she went immediately still wearing her burqa , required garb under taliban rule , because she could not quite believe it was safe to take it off many other women came , too we were standing in this room and then we began to recognize each other s voices coming from under our burqas and we were saying is it really you \? are you still alive \? ' more than half of her charges in prison today are there for moral crimes , a vast category that includes running away from home and intending to commit adultery either crime can taint a woman for the rest of her life also among the inmates are policewomen , most of them in prison for running afoul of morality laws of the six there during a visit last winter , only one was accused of a violent crime \( she tried to kill her husband \) two appeared to have been victims of an unsuccessful effort to blackmail them into paying a bribe to avoid jail , but since they had no money , they ended up in prison forlorn and confused , they were embarrassed that they had accepted an invitation to have dinner with the son of a police commander , setting them up to be arrested for being alone with a man to whom they were not married watching ms naibi is a lesson in what could be possible for women in afghanistan one morning , she was arguing with the male security guards about their schedules just keep on one guy who knows everything , she said the guards sat in silence , leaving it unclear whether they understood her instructions one then complained that the ministry did not act quickly on personnel matters she sighed audibly yes , ok we 'll fix everything , i 'll sort it out the male guards saluted her when they left as they would a male commander yes , there will be negative discrimination against women , but it s up to you to command authority , ms naibi said it does n't matter if you 're a man or a woman it s your duty that defines you with five children and a disabled husband , parveena , 28 , was both desperate for work and overwhelmed by the task of caring for her family there were few choices and none that would pay as well as being a policewoman , she said in an interview barely a month before she was killed in july 2013 parveena was attending a seminar for junior policewomen in jalalabad , the largest city in conservative eastern afghanistan , where tribal law often trumps government authority in contrast with a number of fully veiled women in the room , parveena wore a white shawl over her head and had a warm open smile of the 3 , 850member force in nangarhar province in 2013 , there were just 32 women , which meant most women worked alone in a sea of men , struggling to preserve their reputations i am the only female where i work , parveena said then i do n't talk to anyone , i do n't give anyone my phone number or take anybody s phone number i just come at 8 and leave at 12 and then take the leftover food that people do n't eat for my kids , she said , referring to the leftovers from policemen s lunches even then , she knew the risks my inlaws do n't support me , she said , but then suggested that she had never told them about her job they do n't know only my brothers know still , parveena was enthusiastic about her work her father , a frail man of 70 , said she liked it so much , she persuaded her younger brother to join the police as well her commanders said they respected her hard work , so much so that they entrusted her with the dangerous mission of recruiting more women for the police force when she was visiting her home district of lal pur , near the pakistani border recruiting women for the security services can be dangerous even in a large city , but in a region where the government had no presence , it turned deadly all the more so because as much as a year before she was killed , the taliban learned of her job , said wali khan , 21 , her younger brother she was doing the job secretly , he said , telling only her immediate family and not wearing a uniform then a year ago one of our relatives who was in the taliban found out and he told people that put her life at risk agnesa shinwari , a member of the local provincial council , said , in afghanistan , if your husband allows you to work or your father allows you , it does n't matter the woman is still not safe , she said , if another family member does not approve she said she had heard that cousins of parveena were involved in her death the provincial police accused the taliban , but local taliban commanders denied involvement after the killing , the family quickly called relatives who were in the taliban and they heard there had been a spy , a person they knew in the community who had tipped off the taliban to her visit to her home district her brother s casual reference to taliban relatives is a chilling reminder of how hard it is to know which side people are on or if they are on both her father summed it up bitterly as he sat on a lumpy cot in the bare room in jalalabad where he was visiting his son who killed her \? god knows , god knows better than i everyone is pulling a shawl on their face and calling themselves taliban , he said as word spread that parveena had been killed , some whispered that she had had an affair or had been bold with men madina , 21 , a policewoman who attended seminars with parveena , said the talk of immoral acts was a lie she was a good and clean and honest woman , she said yet the stigma of being a policewoman remains so powerful that even after parveena s father and brothers picked up her body , they could find no mullahs in their village who would bury her or say the funeral prayers there were six mullahs in our village , and after she was killed they disappeared intentionally , her brother wali said the taliban had told the mullahs , do n't do a funeral ceremony for those people , ' and not one would say the prayers for my sister
this is the last in this series of 2015 interviews with philosophers on race this week s conversation is with the scholar , critic and public intellectual bell hooks , who is currently the distinguished professor in residence of appalachian studies at berea college she is the author of many books , including writing beyond race living theory and practice george yancy george yancy over the years you have used the expression imperialist white supremacist capitalist patriarchy to describe the power structure underlying the social order why tie those terms together as opposed to stressing any one of them in isolation \? bell hooks we can t begin to understand the nature of domination if we don t understand how these systems connect with one another significantly , this phrase has always moved me because it doesn t value one system over another for so many years in the feminist movement , women were saying that gender is the only aspect of identity that really matters , that domination only came into the world because of rape then we had so many raceoriented folks who were saying , race is the most important thing we don t even need to be talking about class or gender so for me , that phrase always reminds me of a global context , of the context of class , of empire , of capitalism , of racism and of patriarchy those things are all linked an interlocking system gy i ve heard you speak many times and i noticed that you do so with a very keen sense of humor what is the role of humor in your work \? bh we cannot have a meaningful revolution without humor every time we see the left or any group trying to move forward politically in a radical way , when they re humorless , they fail humor is essential to the integrative balance that we need to deal with diversity and difference and the building of community for example , i love to be in conversation with cornel west we always go high and we go low , and we always bring the joyful humor in the last talk he and i gave together , many people were upset because we were silly together but i consider it a high holy calling that we can be humorous together how many times do we see an africanamerican man and an africanamerican woman talking together , critiquing one another , and yet having delicious , humorous delight \? it s a miracle gy what is your view of the feminist movement today , and how has your relationship to it changed over time \? i believe wholeheartedly that the only way out of domination is love bh my militant commitment to feminism remains strong , and the main reason is that feminism has been the contemporary social movement that has most embraced selfinterrogation when we , women of color , began to tell white women that females were not a homogenous group , that we had to face the reality of racial difference , many white women stepped up to the plate i m a feminist in solidarity with white women today for that reason , because i saw these women grow in their willingness to open their minds and change the whole direction of feminist thought , writing and action this continues to be one of the most remarkable , awesome aspects of the contemporary feminist movement the left has not done this , radical black men have not done this , where someone comes in and says , look , what you re pushing , the ideology , is all messed up you ve got to shift your perspective feminism made that paradigm shift , though not without hostility , not without some women feeling we were forcing race on them this change still amazes me gy what should we do in our daily lives to combat , in that phrase of yours , the power and influence of white supremacist capitalist patriarchy \? what can be done on the proverbial ground \? bh i live in a small , predominantly white town in the bible belt rather than saying , what would jesus do \? i always think , what does martin luther king want me to do today \? then i decide what martin luther king wants me to do today is to go out into the world and in every way that i can , small and large , build a beloved community as a buddhist christian , i also think of buddhist monk thich nhat hanh s saying , let s throw this pebble into the water , it may not go far in the beginning , but it will ripple out so , every day , i m challenging myself , what are you doing , bell , for the creation of the beloved community \? because that s the underground , local , insistence that i be a fundamental part of the world that i m in i ve been to the farmer s market , i ve been to the church bazaar this morning i really push myself to relate to people , that is , people that i might not feel as comfortable relating to there are many kentucky hillbilly white persons who look at me with contempt they cannot turn me around i am doing the same thing as those civil rights activists , those black folk and those white folk who sat in at those diners and who marched it s about humanization and i can t think of another way to imagine how we re going to get out of the crisis of racial hatred if it s not through the will to humanize personally , i draw incredible strength from the images of black people and white people in social movements i personally did not think selma was a great film , but the strength that i gained from the film was thinking about all of those people , those white folks who see selma and say , my god , this is unjust ! let s go do our part and it s awesome when we re called there are many times in this life of mine when i ask myself , what are you willing to give your life for , bell \? when are you willing to get out in the streets knowing that you re risking your health \? and if those older black women who were there in selma , ala , can do this stuff , it just reminds you how incredibly vital this history of struggle has been towards allowing you and i to be in the state of privilege that we live within today gy that point hits home , especially as i think about my own intellectual identity and yet often fail to think about the privilege that comes with it the connecting tie to black , white , hispanic , native people , asian people is the greed and the materialism that we all invest in and share bh i am a total intellectual i tell people that intellectual work is the laboratory that i go into every day without all of those people engaged in civil rights struggles , i would not be here in this laboratory i mean , how many black women have had the good fortune to write more than 30 books \? when i wake up at 4 or 5 in the morning , i do my prayers and meditations , and then i have what i call my study hours i try to read a book a day , a nonfiction book , and then i get to read total trash for the rest of the day that s luxury , that s privilege of a high order the privilege to think critically , and then the privilege to be able to act on what you know gy absolutely you ve talked about how theory can function as a place of healing can you say more about that \? bh i always start with children most children are amazing critical thinkers before we silence them i think that theory is essentially a way to make sense of the world as a gifted child growing up in a dysfunctional family where giftedness was not appreciated , what held me above water was the idea of thinking through , why are mom and dad the way they are \? and those are questions that are at the heart of critical thinking and that s why i think critical thinking and theory can be such a source of healing it moves us forward and , of course , i don t know about other thinkers and writers , but i have the good fortune every day of my life to have somebody contacting me , either on the streets or by mail , telling me about how my work has changed their life , how it has enabled them to go forward and what greater gift to be had as a thinkertheorist , than that \? gy how do you prevent yourself from being seduced by that \? i think that there is that temptation by intellectuals scholars , who are well known , to be seduced into a state of narcissism how do you resist that \? bh first of all , i live in a city of 12 , 000 people where most of them don t have a clue about who bell hooks is for the most part , or where someone asks is bell hooks a person \? there is humility in the life that i lead , because one thing about having my given name , gloria jean , which is such a great appalachian hillbilly name , is that i m not walking around in my daily life usually as bell hooks i m walking around in the dailiness of my life as just the ordinary gloria jean that s changing a bit in the little town that i live in because more of me as a thinker , writer and artist is coming out into the world of the town that i live in i think that i ve been coming out more and more in the fact that the work that i m writing is about spirituality , because one of the central aspects that has kept me grounded in my life has been spirituality growing up , when my mom used to tell me , you re really smart , but you re not better than anyone else , i used to think , why does she go on about that \? and , of course , now i see why it was to keep me grounded and to keep me respecting the different ways of knowing and the knowledges of other people , and not thinking oh , i am so smart , which i think can happen to many wellknown intellectuals i always kind of chuckle at people labeling me a public intellectual i chuckle because people used to say , how have you written so much \? and i d say , by not having a life there is nothing public about the energy , the discipline and solitude it takes to produce so much writing i think of public intellectuals as very different , because i think that they re airing their work for that public engagement really , in all the years of my writing that was not my intention it was to produce theory that people could use i have this phrase that i use , working with the work so if somebody comes up to me , and they have one of those bell hooks books that s abused and battered , and every page is underlined , i know they ve been working with the work and that s where it is for me gy is there a connection between teaching as a space of healing and your understanding of love \? bh well , i believe wholeheartedly that the only way out of domination is love , and the only way into really being able to connect with others , and to know how to be , is to be participating in every aspect of your life as a sacrament of love , and that includes teaching i don t do a lot of teaching these days i am semiretired because , like any act of love , it takes a lot of your energy i was just talking with a neighbor about what it feels like to be working at a needbased college like berea , where none of our students pay tuition , and many of them come from the hills of appalachia we often get discouraged anytime we feel that our college isn t living up to its history of integration and of racial inclusion but then we d see we have students who are doing such amazing things , from the hills of virginia , or tennessee you just know , i am right where i am meant to be , doing what i should be doing , and giving and receiving the love that comes anytime we do that work well poverty has become infinitely more violent than it ever was when i was a girl you lived next door to very poor black people , but who had very joyful lives that s not the poverty of today gy you ve conceptualized love as the opposite of estrangement can you say something about that \? bh when we engage love as action , you can t act without connecting i often think of that phrase , only connect in terms of white supremacy right now for instance , the police stopped me a few weeks ago here in berea , because i was doing something wrong i initially felt fear , and i was thinking about the fact that in all of my 60some years of my life in this country , i have never felt afraid of policemen before , but i feel afraid now he was just total sweetness and yet i thought , what a horrible change in our society that that level of estrangement has taken place that was not there before i know that the essential experience of black men and women has always been different , but from the time i was a girl to now , i never thought the police were my enemy yet , what black woman witnessing the incredible abuse of sandra bland can t shake in her boots if she s being stopped by the police \? when i was watching that video , i was amazed the police didn t shoot her on the spot ! white supremacist white people are crazy i used to talk about patriarchy as a mental illness of disordered desire , but white supremacy is equally a serious and profound mental illness , and it leads people to do completely and utterly insane things i think one of the things that is going on in our society is the normalization of mental illness , and the normalization of white supremacy , and the evocation and the spreading of this is part of that mental illness so remember that we are a culture in crisis our crisis is as much a spiritual crisis as it is a political crisis , and that s why martin luther king , jr was so profoundly prescient in describing how the work of love would be necessary to have a transformative impact gy and of course , that doesn t mean that you don t find an important place in your work for rage , as in your book killing rage \? bh oh , absolutely the first time that i got to be with thich nhat hanh , i had just been longing to meet him i was like , i m going to meet this incredibly holy man on the day that i was going to him , every step of the way i felt that i was encountering some kind of racism or sexism when i got to him , the first thing out of my mouth was , i am so angry ! and he , of course , mr calm himself , mr peace , said , well , you know , hold on to your anger , and use it as compost for your garden and i thought , yes , yes , i can do that ! i tell that story to people all the time i was telling him about the struggles i was having with my male partner at the time and he said , it is ok to say i want to kill you , but then you need to step back from that , and remember what brought you to this person in the first place and i think that if we think of anger as compost , we think of it as energy that can be recycled in the direction of our good it is an empowering force if we don t think about it that way , it becomes a debilitating and destructive force one of the things white people gave us when they gave us integration was full access to the tormenting reality of desire , and the expectation of constant consumption gy since you mentioned sandra bland , and there are so many other cases that we can mention , how can we use the trauma that black people are experiencing , or reconfigure that trauma into compost \? how can black people do that \? what does that look like therapeutically , or collectively \? bh we have to be willing to be truthful and to be truthful , we have to say , the problem that black people face , the trauma of white supremacy in our lives , is not limited to police brutality that s just one aspect i often say that the issue for young black males is the street if you only have the streets , you encounter violence on all sides black on black violence , the violence of addiction , and the violence of police brutality so the question is why at this stage of our history , with so many wealthy black people , and so many gifted black people , how do we provide a place other than the streets for black males \? and it is so gendered , because the street , in an imperialist white supremacist capitalist patriarchy , is male , especially when it is dark there is so much feeling of being lost that it is beyond the trauma of racism it is the trauma of imperialist white supremacist capitalist patriarchy , because poverty has become infinitely more violent than it ever was when i was a girl you lived next door to very poor black people , but who had very joyful lives that s not the poverty of today gy how is the poverty of today different \? bh let s face it , one of the things white people gave us when they gave us integration was full access to the tormenting reality of desire , and the expectation of constant consumption so part of the difference of poverty today is this sort of world of fantasy fantasizing that you ll win the lottery , fantasizing that money will come i always cling to lorraine hansberry s mama saying in a in raisin in the sun , since when did money become life \? i think that with the poverty of my growing up that i lived with and among , we were always made to feel like money is not what life is all about that s the total difference for everyone living right now , because most people in our culture believe money is everything that is the big tie , the connecting tie to black , white , hispanic , native people , asian people the greed and the materialism that we all invest in and share gy when you make that claim , i can see some readers saying that bell is pathologizing black spaces bh as i said , we have normalized mental illness in this society so it s not the pathologizing of black spaces it s saying that the majority of cultural spaces in our society are infused with pathology that s why it s so hard to get out of it , because it has become the culture that is being fed to us every day none of us can escape it unless we do so by conscious living and conscious loving , and that s become harder for everybody i don t have a problem stating the fact that trauma creates wounds , and most of our wounds are not healed as africanamericans we re not really different in that way from all the others who are wounded let s face it wounded white people frequently can cover up their wounds , because they have greater access to material power i find it fascinating that every day you go to the supermarket , and you look at the people , and you look at us , and you look at all of this media that is parading the sorrows and the mental illnesses of the white rich in our society and it s like everybody just skips over that nobody would raise the question , why don t we pathologize the rich \? we actually believe that they suffer mental illness , and that they deserve healing the issue for us as black people is that very few people feel that we deserve healing which is why we have very few systems that promote healing in our lives the primary system that ever promoted healing in black people is the church , and we see what is going on in most churches today they ve become an extension of that material greed gy as you shared being stopped by police , i thought of your book black looks race and representation , where you describe whiteness as a site of terror has that changed for you \? bh i don t think that has changed for most black people that particular essay , representations of whiteness in the black imagination , talks about whiteness , the black imagination , and how many of us live in fear of whiteness and i emphasize the story about the policeman because for many of us that fear of whiteness has intensified i think that white people , for the most part , never think about black people wanting to be in black only spaces , because we do not feel safe in my last book , writing beyond race living theory and practice , i really wanted to raise and problematize the question where do we feel safe as black people \? i definitely return to the home as a place of spiritual possibility , home as a holy place i bought my current house from a conservative white male capitalist who lives across the street from me , and i m so happy in my little home i tell people , when i open the doors of my house it s like these arms come out , and they re just embracing me i think that is part of our radical resistance to the culture of domination i know that i m not who he imagined in this little house he imagined a nice white family with two kids , and i think on some level it was very hard for him to sell his house to a radical black woman , a radical black feminist woman i think all of us , in terms of houses , have our idea , when we love our home , of who we want to be in it but i think black folks in general across class have to restore that sense of resistance in the home when we look at the history of antiracist rebels among black people , so much organizing happened in people s homes i always think about mary mcleod bethune let s just start the college in your living room selfdetermination really does begin at home we re finding out that one of the reasons for why so much black rebel antiracist movements failed is because they didn t take care of the home as a site of resistance so , you have very wounded people trying to lead movements in a world beyond the home , but they were simply not psychologically fit to lead gy that s an important segue to the question about your concept of soul healing with respect to black men what does soul healing among black men look like \? and what role do you think black women play in helping to help nurture that soul healing \? bh every now and then , george , i write a book that hardly anyone pays any attention to one such book in my life is my book on black masculinity , we real cool black men and masculinity an aspect of that book that i found deeply moving is when i use the metaphor of isis and osiris osiris is attacked , and his body parts are spread all over isis , the stern mother , sister and lover , goes and fetches those parts and puts him back together again that sort of metaphor of harmony and friction that can be soulhealing for black people is so real to me often i feel sad , because i think we are in a culture that keeps black men and women further apart from one another , rather than meeting us in that place of shared history , shared story i am so grateful for the black male friends in my life like so many professional black women , i don t have a partner i would like to have one , but i ve been grateful for having conscious , caring , black male comrades and friends , who keep me from any kind of integration of black masculinity , who just keep me in this space of loving blackness to have that kind of bonding is precious these are the constructive moments of our time , and they re not televised when malcolm x said we have to see each other with new eyes , i think that s where selfdetermination begins and how we are with one another let s face it , so many black males and females have suffered mental abandonment , and more than police brutality , that s the core for many of us of our trauma betrayal is always about abandonment and many of us have been emotionally abandoned these are the wounds we have yet to correctly attend to so both black children and biracial children can have the opportunity to truly care for themselves in a way that s optimal for all gy how are your buddhist practices and your feminist practices mutually reinforcing \? bh well , i would have to say my buddhist christian practice challenges me , as does feminism buddhism continues to inspire me because there is such an emphasis on practice what are you doing \? right livelihood , right action we are back to that selfinterrogation that is so crucial it s funny that you would link buddhism and feminism , because i think one of the things that i m grappling with at this stage of my life is how much of the core grounding in ethicalspiritual values has been the solid ground on which i stood that ground is from both buddhism and christianity , and then feminism that helped me as a young woman to find and appreciate that ground the spirituality piece came up for me in my love of beat poetry i came to buddhism through the beats , through gary snyder and jack kerouac they all sort of gave me this other space of groundedness i talk about spirituality more now than ever before , because i see my students suffering more than ever before , especially women students who feel like so much is expected of them they ve got to be the equals of men , but then they ve got to be submissive if they are heteronormative , they have to find a partner it s just so much demand that has led them to depression , to addiction , or suicide and it s amazing how spirituality grounds them feminism does not ground me it is the discipline that comes from spiritual practice that is the foundation of my life if we talk about what a disciplined writer i have been and hope to continue to be , that discipline starts with a spiritual practice it s just every day , every day , every day this interview was conducted by email and edited previous interviews in this series \( with linda martin alcoff , judith butler , noam chomsky , charles mills , falguni a sheth and others \) can be found  george yancy is a professor of philosophy at emory university he has written , edited and coedited numerous books , including black bodies , white gazes , look , a white ! and pursuing trayvon martin , coedited with janine jones follow the new york times opinion section on and on , and sign up for the

people end their lives four states oregon , washington , montana and vermont already allow physicians to prescribe lifeending medication to some patients the california bill , which passed friday in the state senate by a vote of 23 to 14 , will now go to gov , who will roughly triple access to doctorassisted suicide across the country if he signs it mr brown has given little indication of his intentions the california bill is modeled on the law in oregon , with several notable changes the california law would expire after 10 years and have to be reapproved , and doctors would have to consult in private with the patient desiring to die , as part of an effort to ensure that no one would be coerced to end his or her life a primary concern for opponents of the law leaders of the death with dignity movement said they hoped the passage of the california law could be a turning point it allows for individual liberty and freedom , freedom of choice , said mark leno , a democrat from san francisco who compared the issue to gay marriage since oregon approved the country s first law in 1997 , supporters have struggled to expand their reach , amid opposition from religious groups , some medical organizations and lawmakers whose skepticism crosses party lines i'm not going to push the old or the weak out of this world , senator ted gaines , a republican , said on the floor i think that could be the unintended consequence of this legislation more than half the states , plus washington , dc , have put forward bills this year to legalize some kind of assisted suicide , according to the , which is based in portland , ore so far , none of them have become law if it becomes the law in california , that s going to be very , very significant nationally , said george eighmey , vice president of death with dignity and a former state legislator in oregon in spite of the bill s provision about coercion , dr aaron kheriaty , director of the medical ethics program at the university of california , irvine , school of medicine , said that lowincome and underinsured patients would inevitably feel pressure from family members to end their own lives in some cases , when the cost of continued treatment would be astronomical compared with the cost of a few lethal pills he pointed to a involving barbara wagner , a patient who said that her insurance plan had refused to cover an expensive treatment but did offer to pay for physician aid in dying as soon as this is introduced , it immediately becomes the cheapest and most expedient way to deal with complicated endoflife situations , dr kheriaty said you 're seeing the push for assisted suicide from generally white , uppermiddleclass people , who are least likely to be pressured you 're not seeing support from the underinsured and economically marginalized those people want access to better health care mr eighmey said that the argument about pressure from families had the issue backward it s always the loved ones who want the dying person to try one more round of chemo , one more treatment down in mexico until after a in 2006 threw out a justice department effort to block oregon s law , no other state permitted assisted suicide washington adopted its measure in 2008 several northern european countries , including the netherlands , belgium and switzerland , also allow assisted suicide the british parliament on friday voted down a measure that would have permitted physicians to help terminally ill people end their lives previous bills to legalize assisted suicide have failed in california , including one this year , when pressure from the roman catholic church helped stall a similar measure in the assembly \( the bill was resurrected for a special session , where it could bypass assembly committees \) but this year in california , the aidindying movement , as advocates prefer to call it , had a public face , a bay area woman who received a diagnosis of terminal brain and moved with her family to oregon last year so she could end her life on her own terms ms maynard , who died in november at 29 , drew nationwide news media attention for her crusade to die legally under conditions of her own choosing her family has since been involved in lobbying for the california bill opinion within the medical community here has also begun to shift after decades of opposing physicianassisted suicide , the california medical association switched its position this year , adopting a neutral stance and stressing that the decision was a personal one for doctors and patients to make on the senate floor on friday , members told one personal story after another of watching loved ones die , as they argued both for and against assisted suicide senator hannahbeth jackson , a democrat , told of her mother s two requests while suffering from leukemia not to die alone , and to maintain her dignity we are talking about giving people a choice , she said they want to be able to transition out of this life with their dignity though mr brown has been silent about his position on the bill , he has been critical of the decision to bring assisted suicide forward in a special session , where the legislative process is curtailed but backers of the bill have discussed bringing the issue to the voters through a ballot measure if mr brown vetoes it a found that nearly 70 percent of americans support physicianassisted suicide , up 10 percentage points from last year
houston stephen curry was busy assembling another special performance for the golden state warriors on saturday night when adam choice , an admissions official at packer collegiate institute in brooklyn , started exchanging text messages with justin sherman , one of his former college teammates i still ca n't believe that steph is this good , choice recalled writing in leading the warriors to a threegamestonone lead over the houston rockets in the western conference finals , curry has managed to ritualize the extraordinary , whether that means setting a record for 3pointers in a postseason , scoring 40 points against the rockets in game 3 or outmaneuvering every defender who attempts to slow his march to history a victory against the rockets on monday night at toyota center would secure the warriors' first trip to the nba finals since 1975 but for a small group of former players at colby college , a division iii program in waterville , me , every feat by curry presents another opportunity to reminisce about the time they held him in check kind of , sort of when he was a freshman at davidson college on nov 21 , 2006 , before a modest crowd at davidson s john m belk arena , curry shot 10 of 24 from the field against the colby mules sure , he finished with 29 points and yes , davidson eventually plowed its way to a 9969 victory against an undersize opponent but the experience alone was something for the players from colby to savor i remember their next game after us was duke , said drew cohen , the team s starting center and its mystique has only grown as the years have passed at the time , none of the players could have known that curry would go on to become the nba s most valuable player what this guy has become , cohen said , is crazy lightly recruited out of high school , curry was still largely known for being the son of the former nba player dell curry he was not particularly imposing , either , with a slight build and a sixfoot frame but mark gaudet , a guard for colby , kept telling his teammates , this kid is going to be good dick whitmore , who was then the coach at colby , reinforced that message by showing his players film of curry scoring 32 points in a 10point loss to michigan that month colby had opened its season against babson college and washington university , both fine programs but babson was not michigan nick farrell , a guard who would be tasked with defending curry for much of the game , recalled watching the film and thinking , if this guy is torching michigan , what s he going to do to us \? still , for division iii players from maine , an escape to north carolina in late november to face a division i opponent was a thrill at least until their plane landed we get there , and it s snowing , said artie cutrone , a guard who was a sophomore at the time whitmore , meanwhile , was trying to figure out how to contend with davidson s size colby had an outstanding shot blocker in cohen but was otherwise undermanned in the frontcourt whitmore decided that he would have his perimeter players collapse and at least make life more difficult for davidson s post players if davidson was going to beat colby by launching jumpers from the outside , so be it but whitmore , who retired from colby in 2011 , felt it would be more effective than letting davidson feast on layups as for dealing with curry \? he was a firstyear guy , whitmore said , so we said , well , we 'll let him shoot' in hindsight , it was an unconventional strategy but for a while , it seemed to work after falling behind early , colby adapted to davidson s fullcourt pressure and mounted a small run late in the first half i think they came out not expecting us to put up a fight at all , farrell said bob mckillop , davidson s coach , called for a timeout with his team holding a slim lead it was one of those moments where it s kind of why you coach , whitmore said , because my guys get back in the huddle , and it s like , my god , we 're closing in on a division i team mckillop was so vocal during the timeout that players from colby could hear him from their bench his message \? colby might be division iii , but these guys can play so wake up ! bob got his guys going , whitmore said after that , the game became much more complicated for us as curry warmed up , davidson s lead began to swell from 10 to 20 to 30 colby went to a 23 zone for long stretches , but nothing seemed to affect curry i remember that his demeanor never changed , farrell said it did n't matter how you were guarding him even if he was missing shots , he knew he was going to make some curry wound up setting program records for 3pointers made \( nine \) and attempted \( 20 \) it was not his most efficient effort , but he made such an impression on the players from colby that several of them sent him friend requests on facebook after the game curry accepted them all and even wished the players luck for the rest of their season he s got a verified account and all that now , choice said , but i know i'm still friends with him on facebook whitmore wrote in his postgame notes that curry had the quickest release of any player he had ever coached against i mean , he was just amazing even at that time , whitmore said some guys catch and shoot he was touch and shoot many of the former players from that colby team have kept in touch with one another cutrone said he was expecting nine of his teammates to attend his wedding this summer and curry is a consistent topic of conversation when curry scored 54 points at madison square garden two seasons ago , choice sent a message to several of his friends we must be better than the knicks , he wrote
so far the gender revolution has been a onesided effort women have entered previously male precincts of economic and political life , and for the most part they have succeeded they can lead companies , fly fighter jets , even run for president but along the way something crucial has been left out we have not pushed hard enough to put men in traditionally female roles that is where our priority should lie now this is not just about gender equality the stakes are even higher the jobs that many men used to do are gone or going fast , and families need two engaged parents to share the task of raising children as painful as it may be , men need to adapt to what a modern economy and family life demand there has been progress in recent years , but it has n't been equal to the depth and urgency of the transformation we 're undergoing the old economy and the old model of masculinity are obsolete women have learned to become more like men now men need to learn to become more like women will this transformation be good for men \? in the long run , we think so but in any case they do n't really have a choice recent changes in women s status and in the economy are n't going to be reversed men must either adapt or be left behind many men have felt a double whammy a loss of economic status as jobs in traditionally masculine sectors have disappeared and a loss of social status as women have advanced male wages are stagnant and among the less educated , they have fallen median earnings for men with only a high school diploma have dropped in real terms by 28 percent since 1980 these disturbing trends have led many observers to call on boys and men to regain their competitive edge over women , so they can once again be successful breadwinners and leaders but that s the wrong message rather than trying to recreate a patriarchal past , men have to embrace a more feminine future instead , some men , especially those with the bleakest economic prospects , are retreating into what some scholars have labeled hypermasculinity at the extreme this leads to violence and misogyny , and may be a form of compensation for low status or loss of respect but given their own limited prospects , these men are the very ones who most need female partners , along with a partner s paycheck , to survive in today s economy the male malaise starts in the classroom girls have overtaken boys at every stage of education , with higher grades from the early years through high school and college men are now a minority on college campuses ,  the greater success being enjoyed by girls results not from superior intellect but from better study habits girls typically demonstrate more focus , effort and selfdiscipline boys and young men are more likely to be distracted by video games , or even derailed by drink or drugs armed with a better education and more skills , women have also advanced steadily in the workplace , and look set to continue to do so this is not to say that the gender gap has closed america s boardrooms and legislatures are still maledominated women still , on average , 8 for every 10 that their male counterparts bring home but the wage gap is shrinking rapidly among younger workers the labor market is becoming steadily more femalefriendly jobs are being created as the economy recovers from the blow it received during the great recession the problem is that they are largely women s jobs , so men are n't taking them women have moved into formerly allmale provinces like law and business , but men have not made the reverse trek into health and education lately , there has been a laudable push to get girls and women into jobs that require stem skills \( science , technology , engineering and math \) but it is equally important to train and encourage men to take jobs that require skills in health , education , administration and literacy , socalled heal jobs right now , heal jobs are dominated by women men make up 20 percent of elementary and middleschool teachers , 9 percent of nurses , 16 percent of personal care aides and 6 percent of personal assistants until men seize opportunities in these pink collar sectors , they will continue to lose out in this dynamic area of the labor market women currently dominate the sectors expected to produce the most jobs unless the gender imbalance in the 30 fastestgrowing occupations changes , women will take up a million jobs that would otherwise have gone to men there are no legal obstacles to men becoming schoolteachers or nurses , so this is largely a question of culture and attitude we need to match the campaigns to help girls and women see traditionally male jobs as appropriate for them with equally effective efforts in the other direction small messages can be powerful here we know that girls are less likely to apply to study science if they see boyoriented posters , featuring star trek or boys almost surely react the same way to images and environments with a feminine feel stewardesses have become flight attendants good so why not call nurses health attendants \( if entry level \) or health associates \( if more highly trained \) \? getting more men into teaching would have two advantages widening male job prospects and at the same time providing more diverse role models for boys in the classroom men need to adapt on the home front , too women are now the primary breadwinners in of all households with children under 18 , according to the pew research center most of these women are single parents but the proportion of married mothers outearning their husbands has also risen , from 4 percent in 1960 to 17 percent in 2015 in half the families where both parents work full time , the mother earns as much as or more than the father men are doing some 73 hours per week in 2011 , compared with 26 hours in 1985 , but there has been no increase , and in fact a slight decline , in their contribution to housework there needs to be much faster progress toward a more equal division of domestic labor family leave policies can be designed to help here , though the frequency with which they are relabeled maternity leave shows how far behind we still are right now , the united states is the only advanced country without a national paid leave policy there are some small signs of hope from the campaign trail hillary rodham clinton proposes a national mandate requiring employers to offer all new parents three months of paid time off senator marco rubio suggests a 25 percent tax credit for companies that provide at least four weeks of paid leave to employees we should go further , and institute leave rights specifically and solely for fathers policy is usually built on the assumption that if there is a father in the picture , he should either be earning or paying child support his role as a potential caretaker is typically ignored or stigmatized sweden and germany have already successfully introduced this kind of use it or lose it leave policy \( in other words , only the father can make use of it \) , and a similar program in quebec demonstrates what can be accomplished since 2006 , parents in the province have been offered a generous benefit of 70 percent income replacement for a year a critical feature of the policy is that five weeks of leave are reserved for fathers as a result , the proportion of fathers taking time off from work jumped from 21 to 75 percent the amount of time these fathers took off also increased , by an average of three weeks the fatheronly element of the policy may have helped to destigmatize men who stayed home , by the economist ankita patnaik the effects lasted , too in the three years following the leave , mothers and fathers continued to pursue a more egalitarian division of both domestic and market work there is an important message here policies deliberately aimed at helping fathers to take on a bigger role at home can have profound and rapid effects on gender roles more symmetry in gender roles will also reshape \( and is already reshaping \) what economists unromantically label marriage markets the old model of the marriage contract was lopsided women would marry men who were more educated , more successful and older than they were \( social scientists , even less romantically , call this hypergamy \) but the idea that men will be the senior partner in a marriage is no longer realistic soon , there will be as many successful women as men this means men need to get used to the idea of marrying up and women to the idea of marrying down this seems to be happening to some extent already in 2012 , 27 percent of newlywed men married up educationally more men ought to be doing what women did historically improving their economic prospects by marrying well with apologies to jane austen , even a man who is not in possession of a fortune will still be in want of a wife ideally one who has a fortune of her own the problem is that many men and women , disoriented by the shakeup of gender roles , are not marrying at all lesseducated adults , especially resulting in a classbased marriage gap marriage rates among men under 35 have dropped by 23 percentage points since 1980 outdated ideas are doing some damage here too many men and women are holding out for a traditional marriage when the traditional conditions that supported it have largely disappeared men with poor job prospects do not see themselves as husband material many of the women they know agree with them more educated couples are meanwhile reshaping marriage into a more symmetrical and egalitarian institution married men seem to be adapting more quickly , probably because they are more educated and more economically secure in feminist thought , marriage is typically seen as a patriarchal institution twentyfirstcentury marriage seems in fact to be providing fertile ground for a renegotiation of gender roles in an egalitarian direction but rather than encouraging the transition to these more equal marriages , public policies are too often formulated , framed or communicated in a way that reinforces , rather than replaces , outdated gender stereotypes there is , for example , a growing desire among some policy mavens to create more marriageable men by providing them with the kinds of apprenticeships and wage subsidies that will enhance their marriage prospects this whole enterprise is shot through with a breadwinnermale definition of marriage that is well past its sellby date none of this is to say that better wages and more skills are n't needed for men they are , desperately but it is just as important to keep lifting up women s skills , earnings and incomes we do n't want a world in which men can get better jobs than women simply because they are men nor are we going to restore marriages based on the superior earning power of men resistance to these kinds of changes in familial roles is often based on assumptions about innate biological differences there is little doubt that evolutionary differences exist but it is hard to say how much they influence the adoption of certain roles under current cultural conditions we suspect beliefs about innate differences are often an excuse for preserving the status quo if the role of biology is exaggerated , society will suffer cultural recalibration to the new economic and social realities certainly wo n't happen overnight think how easily the terms working mother and career woman still trip off the tongue , by comparison with working father or career man about a third of adults in the united states still agree that it is much better for everyone involved if the man is the achiever outside the home and the woman takes care of the home and family this is a clear improvement over the 1970s , when more than half concurred but attitudes have shifted most slowly among men and women with the least education among those without a high school diploma , a majority still believe in the solebreadwinner model \( even the women split 5050 on the question \) it has been clear for a long time that cramped gender roles are bad for women it is becoming obvious that now they are hurting men , too so a transformation of our ideas of male roles and masculinity is required , if many of the economic and social shifts described above are actually going to occur this kind of cultural change is hard , of course but it can happen sometimes quickly think of the gains that women have made in the last 50 years , or changing attitudes toward gay rights , and interracial marriage america now seems to be experiencing a renewed bout of cultural turbulence over what it means to be a woman , or a wife a man , or a husband gay marriage , even after legalization , sharply divides opinion women s reproductive freedom is being curtailed the growing confidence and strengthening rights of the transgender community are causing wildly disproportionate anxiety the way forward , we believe , is for men to embrace and adapt to the new , more androgynous world there is no point in harking back the world in which highpaid manufacturing jobs could support a family , and where women were expected to focus only on being wives and mothers is gone women have shown they are ready for this transition but what about men \?
this post has spoilers for sunday s episode of true detective season 2 , episode 3 , maybe tomorrow well it s been a suspenseful couple of weeks but our first big mystery is solved ray velcoro is the true detective it hadn t been clear which , among him , ani and paul , was the truest of the three \( we were pretty sure it wasn t paul \) but going by the standard of unkillability established last year by rust cohle \( catastrophic stab wound \) and marty hart \( ax to chest \) , it is ray who claims the title by shaking off last week s seemingly fatal shotgun attack sure , the show would have us believe ray s assailant used the sort of shells like cops use in riots to inflict only a couple of cracked ribs \( i couldn t make out exactly what kind of slugs he meant , thanks to the mumbly dialogue issue that has vexed our commenters \) but i choose to believe that , like rust and marty , ray is simply too true to die whatever the reason , we should all be thankful because with the possible exception of the drunken mayor and his nutty family , with their eye medicine and their hookers dropping from the sky , ray is the best thing about this show by a mile \( more on him in a minute \) as for the rest of it \? well it s still pretty convoluted on sunday more was revealed about the acidblinded , groinblasted ben caspere , none of it flattering his lifestyle car , house , trips to the highend sex club was being largely underwritten by that catalyst group and because there wasn t enough else going on , we learned that he also had a bunch of diamonds in a safety deposit box \( can we please get a prequel about the life of ben caspere \? the caligula of city hall would make the wolf of wall street look like the red balloon \) of course , this being true detective , everyone s too mired in their relationship miseries to pay any of this the proper attention ani s doofus ex nearly became the first person to lose his teeth this week , an honor that later went to danny santos paul is contending with his own conflicted urges as well as the affections of an old army buddy , the jack to his ennis  and then there s frank , whose continuing diminishment took him from an unnatural liaison in the fertility clinic to a wake in a warehouse to a clumsy fistfight in his old club with santos \( sorry , danny your grill ain t that thing no more , what it used to was silver lining maybe it was what was making you spout such nonsense \) you ll recall that last week frank crushed his respectable eyeglasses , signaling his reembrace of criminality in order to reclaim what s been taken from him on sunday he continued along that trajectory , adding a construction shakedown to the bookie protection scheme he seemed to be setting up last week so what did we learn on sunday \? well we now know the cadillac of death belonged to a film production that is shooting in vinci , one overseen by a manbunned asianamerican director \( now where have i seen that before \? \) that this man is portrayed as a highly unpleasant degenerate is , i m sure , in no way a jab at cary fukunaga , the director of the first season of this show who rightly gets much of the credit for its memorable look and feel \( there have been persistent rumors of tension between the mr fukunaga and nic pizzolatto , the series creator , but the latter has repudiated them , for what it s worth \) said cadillac went up in flames , would you believe it , a block away from ani and ray as they investigated its disappearance they gave chase to what turned out to be yet another masked perp before a semi and ray s busted ribs brought an end to the pursuit we also learned that caspere s camera and hard drive were taken , which , wouldn t the birdman have taken them when he killed the guy \? finally , we perhaps , got some further insight into who the birdman might be or might be working for , based on the fact that he let ray live i m no columbo \( loved that scene \) , but here are a few candidates lt burris there s something off about this guy , right \? he even has a raptoresque face , speaking of birdmen he appeared to be the first one on the scene and he s also , obviously , a cop \( remember ray talked about the ammo being shells like cops use \) burris is also aggressively steering ray toward a pimp or some other perpetrator related to caspere s perversities , discouraging deeper investigation i could see him being involved , perhaps in league with the mayor we saw his bloodthirsty side on sunday when he learned that ani visited his house i don t think he d do any actual killing himself but could he be using henchmen to consolidate his power \? or working with someone like osip who seems almost too obvious as a suspect to force frank out \? whatever he may be up to , he would have to know a dead cop would draw more scrutiny from the state authorities a turncoat in frank s camp we saw what little respect frank s criminal cohorts have for him these days , and who , besides his own people , would realize how much money he d given to caspere \? now another of frank s associates has been murdered and his enterprise continues to crumble but why would one of frank s guys spare ray \? because they think he s a burnout who will bag the case after a good scare \? a spraytanned rick springfield not actually a suspect i just hope he comes back or it could be someone else entirely , a yettoberevealed villain who realized he stupidly left the camera behind , amid all the eyeburning and pelvis shooting , and went back to find ray snooping around feel free to share your own theories in the comments as for ray himself , well however implausible his survival may or may not be , i m happy to have him around , as i said it s a welltrodden role , the able but faded and compromised lawman , one that plays to mr farrell s strengths as an actor his soulful eyes and hangdog demeanor , not to mention the droopy bolo tie , signal a man who s given up on himself and plenty of other things , too these are the kinds of guys who are handed hot potatoes because they ll do whatever they re told in order to get rid of them ray accepts dualities must be effected to serve public interests , lt burris said last week and what has that gotten him \? his selfloathing drove away his family , the state attorney general wants to arrest or flip him or both , and his buddy sent him to be shotgunned in a sex den by a guy in a bird mask he began sunday s episode shot up , urinesoaked and being lipsynch serenaded by a dimestore conway twitty if that s not rock bottom , i m not sure what is it looks like the gunshots actually might have been just the thing to get ray off of his back by midepisode he was angry , drinking water \( ! ! \) and lit from within by a new resolve , though where it all takes him is anyone s guess oh son , fred ward , the latest of this season s complicated fathers , tells him in a dream sequence they kill you they shoot you to pieces it may still happen but for now it seems like whatever thrills we ll derive from this season of true detective will come from ray bouncing back to find himself again a few thoughts while we schedule a physical it s possible to live with unhealthy habits , but it helps if you don t have every one under the sun , ray s incredulous physician tells him noted speaking of selfabuse , was that the boozehound cop stan that was snapping photos of paul and his buddy \? i couldn t quite make it out always happy to have fred ward involved by the way , that was some pretty amazing vitality range he showed on sunday , going from a hale policeman in the dream sequence to a decrepit , halfpensioned stoner watching kirk douglas flicks on the couch what do you think \?

las vegas it is called a ring , even though it is square , and on saturday night , it will be a center of attention when a boxing ring is the most intimate of sporting venues , a 20footby20foot elevated square , framed by thick bands and topped by canvas , with none of the vastness of a football field or loose dimensions of a baseball park yet it is afforded none of the same reverence a couple of weeks ago , jay cline walked out of the mgm grand garden arena , where he is the operations director , into the bright daylight he crossed an alley and entered the ground floor of a parking garage this is it , he said , pointing to a heap of disparate parts stacked on two carts , occupying a space about the size of a parking spot it was the ring that would contain one of the biggest fights in boxing history stripped of its significance , dismantled of its identity , the ring looked like spare parts from an abandoned project , maybe leftover pieces of scaffolding not long before , workers had dug into the pile to make sure all the pieces were there they were there were four steel corner posts \( one red , one blue and two neutral white \) , 32 support beams , 36 sheets of 4footby8foot plywood , 10 5footby12foot foam mats \( about an inch thick \) , four ropes \( each more than 80 feet long \) , 16 turnbuckles \( four for each corner \) and various pads and covers there were no bolts \( like those of a puzzle , the pieces connect with tongueandgroove simplicity \) and no springs \( the bounciness of a ring is a product of wide swaths of plywood and padding \) there was , however , a canvas , fringed with laces and decorated with the mgm grand logo long gone are the days of fighting on a blank canvas , like the one upon which muhammad ali stood over a fallen sonny liston but this canvas will be replaced saturday night by one specially made to promote the fight s sponsors led by the beer maker tecate , they combined to pay at least 12 million for the right to put their logo where , with luck , one of the fighters will fall and be photographed we 'll put ours over the real one for a while on fight day so people do n't get footprints all over it , cline said a boxing ring is a rather simple thing , not much more difficult to assemble than ikea furniture the mgm grand bought its ring in 2010 from everlast for about 5 , 000 , cline said the previous ring was retired , without ceremony , despite hosting dozens of memorable fights , including the one in which mike tyson bit off a piece of evander holyfield s ear the mayweatherpacquiao fight will be the 20th main event in this ring the first , on nov 6 , 2010 , was a featherweight championship bout between juan manuel lopez and rafael marquez eleven of the past 15 have featured either mayweather \( six times \) or pacquiao \( five \) when pacquiao dropped facefirst to the mat , knocked unconscious by in 2012 \? same ring different canvas for mayweather , it will be his 11th straight fight , and 14th over all , at the mgm grand garden arena , a short drive from his home \( pacquiao , who trains in los angeles , will make his 12th appearance at the arena \) but mayweather does not believe in a homering advantage when a fighter fights , they 're on an even playing field , mayweather said a ring is a ring , no matter where they fight at a ring is a ring the nevada athletic commission tries to make sure of it its provision 467442 , titled requirements for boxing or kickboxing ring , details the specifications among them the ring must be at least 20feet square within the ropes , with at least 18 inches of apron beyond the ropes \( the mgm ring is 24by24 total , with a twofoot apron \) the floor of the ring cannot be more than five feet above the floor of the arena \( mgm s stands 40 inches tall \) and the ring must have four ropes , each at least an inch thick and covered in soft material , with the bottom rope 18 inches above the canvas on the day of the fight , officials will examine the ring , checking for an uneven surface in the floor , looking for wrinkles in the canvas , bouncing against the ropes there are no specific guidelines for rope tension , just an interest in keeping the fighters from falling through if you have heavyweights fighting , you want the ropes a little tighter , said bob bennett , the commission s executive director the ropes are tightened or loosened by the turnbuckles these days , vertical spacers not only keep the ropes from separating too much , they provide yet another spot for sponsorship one of bennett s prefight concerns is the weight that the ring can support , given the hype and pomp that this bout has generated and the entourages of the parties involved everlast told him that the mgm grand garden arena ring can hold up to 10 , 000 pounds to bennett , that means 50 people weighing an average of 200 pounds , minus the weight of camera and production equipment not much but it serves as a reminder that in boxing , more than most sports , the venue is temporary , an afterthought to the event presented on it there is no nostalgia or admiration for it , no recollection of one ring over another , especially when compared with the countless places in sports where the setting is granted at least as much significance as its latest event yankee stadium , the rose bowl , augusta national and churchill downs among them a ring , even this ring , is just steel , plywood and padding , less a field of play than a theatrical stage they 're all basically the same , bennett said in a matter of a couple of hours on monday , about 10 workers turned those puzzle pieces from the parking garage into the setting for mayweather vs pacquiao under the dim lights of an otherwise empty arena , in the center of the floor and surrounded by silence , it looked small and insignificant come saturday night , however , the ring will be surrounded by nearly 17 , 000 people , illuminated from above by an enormous structure of colored lights , and observed by millions of fight fans around the world cameras and eyes will focus on the ring and , shortly after the fight ends and the arena empties , the ring will be deconstructed and returned to its place , stowed away in the garage until next time
this week , baltimore was engulfed in violent revolt as citizens took to the street in the wake of the mysterious and disturbing death of freddie gray after he 'd been taken into police custody projectiles were thrown stores were looted and some set ablaze police officers were injured it was ugly and in that moment , america was again forced to turn its face toward its forsaken and ask tough questions and attempt to answer a few even hillary clinton stepped into the fray wednesday ,  we have to come to terms with some hard truths about race and justice in america there is something profoundly wrong when africanamerican men are still far more likely to be stopped and searched by police , charged with crimes , and sentenced to longer prison terms than are meted out to their white counterparts this was an aggressive speech by clinton and a major departure from her 2008 run , when , after an embarrassing loss to barack obama in the iowa caucuses , she went on the attack in new hampshire , with abc news reporting it this way while the senator was vague , her campaign pointed out to abc news examples of obama s liberal positions , including his 2004 statement to abolish mandatory minimum sentences for federal crimes on tuesday , the day before his wife s speech , bill clinton had weighed in as the  former us president has called for an end to mass incarceration , admitting that changes in penal policy that happened largely under his watch put too many people in prison and for too long' and overshot the mark' the guardian goes on to explain in 1994 clinton championed a crime bill that laid down several of the foundations of the country s current mass incarceration malaise vowing to be tough on crime' a quality that had previously been more closely associated with the republicans and which clinton adopted under his triangulation' ploy he created incentives to individual states to build more prisons , to put more people behind bars and to keep them there for longer his also presided over the introduction of a federal threestrikes law that brought in long sentences for habitual offenders hillary clinton s speech on wednesday was indeed a remarkable and audacious one for the candidate , and went far further than many of her republican rivals would dare to go \( although there is growing bipartisan consensus around prison reform \) , but the unacknowledged and unexplained shift in the middle of a heated moment could quite reasonably raise doubts of sincerity or commitment to execution the black community in america has been betrayed by democrats and republicans alike it has been betrayed by america itself therefore , it can be hard to accept at face value any promises made or policies articulated history demonstrates that too many forked tongues have delivered too many betrayed covenants as james baldwin put it in his essay journey to atlanta of all americans , negroes distrust politicians most , or more accurately , they have been best trained to expect nothing from them more than other americans , they are always aware of the enormous gap between election promises and their daily lives baldwin continued it is true that the promises excite them , but this is not because they are taken as proof of good intentions they are the proof of something more concrete than intentions that the negro situation is not static , that changes have occurred , and are occurring and will occur this , in spite of the daily , deadend monotony it is this daily , deadend monotony , though , as well as the wise desire not to be betrayed by too much hoping , which causes them to look on politicians with such an extraordinarily disenchanted eye it is this disenchantment , as well as the steady beat of black bodies falling , the constant murmur of black pain and the incessant sting of black subjugation that contributed to the conflagration of rage this week in baltimore you could easily argue that that rage was misdirected , that most of the harm done was to the social fabric and the civil and economic interests in the very neighborhoods that most lack them you would be right but misdirected rage is not necessarily illegitimate rage some might even contextualize the idea of misdirection the activist deray mckesson argued this week about the violence that erupted in baltimore i do n't have to condone it to understand it indeed , the atlantic s tanehisi coates in november that violent revolt has often been the catalyst for change in this country and that nonviolence , at least in part , draws its power from the untenable alternative of violence none of this promotes violence as a tactic , but rather is a fuller understanding of the contradictions of america s current , incessant appeals for peace we ca n't roundly condemn violent revolt now while ignoring the violent revolts that have littered this country s history we ca n't rush to label violent protesters as thugs while reserving judgment about the violence of police killings until a full investigation has been completed and all the facts are in we ca n't condemn explosions of frustration born of generations of marginalization and oppression while paying only passing glances to similar explosions of frustration over the inanity of a sports team s victory or loss or a gathering for a  nonviolence , as a strategy , hinges on faith it is a faith in ultimate moral rectitude and the perfectibility of systems of power but that faith can be hard to find in communities that see systems of power in which they feel they have no stake and an absence of moral courage on the part of the powerful to expand the franchise it has been my experience that people who feel no investment in systems of power no belief that they have access to that power and that that power will treat them fairly are the ones most likely to attack those systems with whatever power they think they have the time that any population will silently endure suffering is termlimited and the end of that term is unpredictable , often set by a moment of trauma that pushes a simmering discontent over into civil disobedience and , in those moments , america feigns shock and disbelief where did this anger come from \? how can we quickly restore calm \? how do we instantly start to heal \? that is because america likes to hide its sins that is because it wants its disaffected , dispossessed and disenfranchised to use the door under the steps that is because america sees its underclass as some sort of infinity sponge capable of quietly absorbing disadvantage , neglect and oppression forever for the greater good of superficial calm and illusory order and expected to do so no one of good conscience and sound judgment desires violence or would ever advocate for it as the rev dr martin luther king jr put it , the ultimate weakness of violence is that it is a descending spiral , begetting the very thing it seeks to destroy but king is not the only person worthy of quoting here there is also the quote often attributed to zora neale hurston if you are silent about your pain , they 'll kill you and say you enjoyed it
washington and prime minister of offered radically divergent approaches to the perils of a nucleararmed on monday even as they tried to cool down the personal nature of a longdistance dispute that has inflamed relations between the united states and israel for more than a month on the eve of mr netanyahu s hotly debated address to congress , the two leaders separately disclaimed personal animosity while laying out what amounts to the biggest policy schism between the two countries in years mr obama defended his diplomatic efforts to negotiate a deal with iran while mr netanyahu presented them as dangerously na ve i have a moral obligation to speak up in the face of these dangers while there is still time to avert them , mr netanyahu told thousands of israel supporters in washington for 2 , 000 years , my people , the jewish people , were stateless , defenseless , voiceless he added today , we are no longer silent today , we have a voice and tomorrow , as prime minister of the one and only jewish state , i plan to use that voice a few hours later , mr obama said that he and mr netanyahu had a substantial disagreement over how to prevent iran from obtaining but he suggested that mr netanyahu was an alarmist , saying that the israeli leader had been unduly skeptical of a preliminary accord intended to slow the iranian during negotiations aimed at a longerterm resolution netanyahu made all sorts of claims this was going to be a terrible deal , this was going to result in iran getting 50 billion worth of relief , iran would not abide by the agreement , mr obama told the reuters news agency none of that has come true mr obama said that any deal would have to ensure that iran was not capable of building a nuclear weapon in less than a year , and that the agreement must stand for at least 10 years if they do agree to it , he said , it would be far more effective in controlling their nuclear program than any military action we could take , any military action israel could take , and far more effective than sanctions will be mr netanyahu s trip to washington , coming just two weeks before israeli elections and three weeks before a deadline in the iran talks , has polarized politicians in both countries the prime minister s speech to a joint meeting of congress on tuesday arranged by speaker without consulting the white house immediately took on a partisan flavor , and mr obama refused to meet with mr netanyahu because his visit comes so close to the israeli elections vice president joseph r biden jr and more than 50 democratic lawmakers plan to skip mr netanyahu s speech while the white house has not publicly encouraged a boycott , it sent an email late monday inviting house democratic aides to a trade meeting at the white house on tuesday at a time that would make it hard for them to attend the speech advocates on both sides have published incendiary newspaper ads in recent days , including one attacking , the president s national security adviser the president expressed grievance about the speaking invitation , which the white house has interpreted as a way of bashing mr obama and undercutting the iran talks in the reuters interview , mr obama said it would be as if democrats in congress invited the french president to speak after opposing president george w bush s invasion of iraq i guarantee you that some of the same commentators who are cheerleading now would have suggested that it was the wrong thing to do , he said but the president and his team also seemed intent on tamping down the intensity of the dispute secretary of state , in geneva for more talks with iran , made a point of defending israel before the united nations human rights council on monday and mr obama sent ms rice and , his ambassador to the united nations , to address the conference in washington this is not a personal issue , mr obama said i think that it is important for every country in its relationship with the united states to recognize that the us has a process of making policy even though ms rice said last week that the issue could be destructive to bipartisan support of israel , mr obama said monday that it was a distraction and would not be permanently destructive mr netanyahu , appearing before an estimated 16 , 000 supporters of israel at the aipac conference , characterized the disagreement over iran as a family fight that would ultimately be overcome , and he expressed gratitude to mr obama for his support of israel over the years my speech is not intended to show any disrespect to president obama or the esteemed office that he holds , mr netanyahu told the crowd , which greeted him with standing ovations i have great respect for both he said he was sorry if anyone interpreted his visit as a political shot at mr obama the last thing anyone who cares about israel , the last thing that i would want , is for israel to become a partisan issue , he said , and i regret that some people have misperceived my visit here this week as doing that israel has always been a bipartisan issue israel should always remain a bipartisan issue but he emphasized that the threat of a nucleararmed iran looked different from jerusalem than it does from washington american leaders worry about the security of their country , mr netanyahu said israeli leaders worry about the survival of their country some supporters said they hoped mr netanyahu s measured language might defuse some of the anger of recent weeks i think he did well and lowered the temperature , said abraham h foxman , the national director of the antidefamation league , who had called on mr netanyahu to cancel the speech because of the fallout he could have pepped them up he did not it was an important message opponents of mr netanyahu said he had done lasting harm i'm here to do damage control , said erel margalit , a labor member of parliament who attended the aipac conference i'm here to say we , too , are very concerned about iran becoming a threshold nuclear state , but we 're interested in getting the discussions back to where they were republicans maintained that it was mr obama who had done the damage by making a fuss over a speech rather than paying attention to the substance of mr netanyahu s message the address is an opportunity for you to hear from the leader of one of our closest allies about the grave threats we face from radical islam and iran , mr boehner s office said in an email the tension of the moment was reflected at the aipac conference before ms power s speech , when the audience was advised to treat all our speakers as guests in our home ms power and ms rice both used their speeches to reaffirm mr obama s support for israel and his determination to prevent iran from obtaining nuclear weapons but ms rice encountered skepticism when she laid out the argument for a possible deal , with the audience applauding the goal of barring iran from nuclear enrichment altogether even as she called that unrealistic sound bites wo n't stop iran from getting a nuclear weapon , ms rice said strong diplomacy backed by pressure can
it happened in the blink of an eye the waters around manhattan rose more than three feet lowlying areas along the hudson and east rivers were swamped it was hurricane sandy all over again , but this time , the high water was here to stay , and it would only continue to rise miranda massie did what anyone sane person would do in this situation she fled to new jersey her hand manipulated the virtual reality device at the jockey club museum of climate change in hong kong , and the newly inundated new york city was left behind for the relative dryness of paramus or was it hackensack \? ms massie was in hong kong to visit what she says is the world s only museum specifically devoted to an issue that many people , including herself , view as the most pressing one facing humankind she s the executive director of the climate museum launch project , a group based in new york that is seeking to build a similar , but far bigger and more ambitious , museum in manhattan in hong kong , she sought ideas and inspiration the museum , financed by a grant from a club that runs horse racing and other betting activities , had some to offer one was the enormous projector screen that showed the effects of rising sea levels on cities across the globe she found another in the photo booths at the end of the tour that offered digital pictures of the visitors in a polar setting the chinese research vessel xue long , or snow dragon , in the background , polar bears and penguins in the foreground to get the photo , visitors have to make a simple carbonreducing promise choices included travel less by airplane , bring your own shopping bag and eat vegetables rather than meat at the end of the tour , a screen showed the effect of the combined commitments of the more than 27 , 000 people who have made the pledges 9978 million grams of carbon removed from the atmosphere it s very hard to communicate effectively with a 5yearold and a 45yearold , ms massie said so you have to build really sophisticated and interactive displays to do that it is the focus on what people can do collectively to reduce carbon emissions that will be the main focus of the new york museum , rather than a scary look at what the future may hold flooded coastal cities , droughts , storms those calamities will not be ignored , but the focus will be on ways to mitigate climate change and to adapt to it there s research currently that shows the more people learn about climate , the more they tend to emotionally shut down and disengage , ms massie said not everybody , but most people because it s distressing and because it s very clear that just changing the light bulbs in your own home doesn t matter so you have to make it clear that you re part of a broader set of efforts and those broader efforts can succeed the hong kong museum occupies one floor of a highrise building on a university campus since it opened in december 2013 , it has brought in just over 56 , 000 visitors , more than a third of them students the museum s goal , according to its program director , cecilia lam , is to raise awareness of climate change in hong kong , especially among children the major difference between our project and miranda s it seems to me that they focus on the whole world , ms lam said our main group of targets is people in hong kong ms massie , 48 , who worked for years as a publicinterest lawyer , is looking for donors she hopes to set up an interim museum , bigger than the one in hong kong , in an office building or even on a barge in new york in the next two years , with a permanent site in manhattan \( or possibly brooklyn \) by 2020 and ms massie s goal is far more ambitious the new york museum would aim to attract at least a million visitors a year and seek to influence the world , including political leaders in the united states at the end of the tour , visitors would be encouraged to volunteer their time to help groups that are trying to address climate change doing anything from making calls on behalf of the natural resources defense council to volunteering to help elect a candidate who is determined to reduce carbon emissions we want to be a hub for the world for climate solutions , ms massie said we want to be a beacon for the world the goals of the hong kong museum are far more modest absent from the museum is any prominent mention of the fact that hong kong is part of a country , china , that is far and away the world s leading carbon emitter , putting about twice as much carbon into the atmosphere as the no 2 polluter , the united states the many schoolchildren coming to the hong kong museum on field trips get a very different message the first part of the museum replicates a trip on the xue long , highlighting its polar research , displaying mockups of ice cores taken from the polar regions and discussing the dangers climate change poses to polar bears , penguins and seals the use of xue long is just one way to get the public interested in what the scientists are doing , ms lam said we tried to use a storytelling approach back in new york , the simulator increases the water level one meter , two meters , three meters , four ms massie noted that one possible future for new york is for some parts to surrender to the waters , to become a sort of venice charming as that might sound , rising sea levels , she says , will be especially devastating for people living in coastal regions of poor nations , such as bangladesh it was the enormity of the problem that led ms massie to shift her focus away from school desegregation and affirmative action and toward the environment i came to see climate change specifically is going to determine our fate as a species in a way that none of these other things is capable of doing , she said
i looked up for a moment , and there he was holding a bouquet of roses , checking his watch , looking down tottenham court road for a girl who said she 'd meet him there then he dissipated like mist it did n't surprise me that he 'd vanish like that , though that young man had ceased to exist decades ago the pub across the street had been my regular outpost back in 1979 , when i was a 20yearold student in london , studying british literature i could n't believe it was still there but then , there are times i can hardly believe that i'm still here , either it s inevitable that an american traveling in europe might find her thoughts turning to her own romantic history for me , this was not only because travel is inherently romantic , but also because i had the great fortune , half a lifetime ago , to fall in love for the first time in this very city , in this very place i walked through the door and to my surprise i found the place remarkably unchanged which is more than we can say about some people i was in london on business for glaad , the lgbt advocacy nonprofit organization i stood at the bar and had a pint of bitter there were a lot of couples some gay , some straight , watching a rugby game on tv so far as i knew , i was the only transgender woman in the pub but then , what did i know \? even for a person for whom the gender business is often the only business at hand , other people s gender is still , sometimes , none of my business one of the rugby teams scored a goal , and everyone cheered and hugged men and women , women and women , men and men as i drank my pint , i thought with wonder how the world had changed in the 36 years since i had been here last during my visit , i had found many brits fully accepting on the issue of lesbian , gay and bisexual equality but transgender issues , as always , seemed to stop people short my host at the house of lords for a glaad board meeting was the legendary michael cashman , a man rightly revered for his civil rights work , and not least for his cofounding , with ian mckellen , of stonewall , an lgbt advocacy group when i said , speaking of trans issues , it s not about who you want to go to bed with , it s who you want to go to bed as , mr cashman stopped me , looked at me thoughtfully , and said , say that again \? a week later , in paris , i asked my wife if she ever felt unsafe in a foreign city expressing her love for me we were walking past the cole militaire late at night , holding hands , the rotating spotlight at the top of the eiffel tower cutting through the dark above us she said no not anymore the world has changed then she said anyway , we 're middleaged women we 're invisible i wish that i shared her optimism about those changes violence against gay people is on the rise in france there was a 78 percent rise in homophobic acts in 2013 , according to a french watchdog group my spirits had n't been raised by some of the conversations i 'd had in london , either there , i met the activist bisi alimi , who came out on a nigerian television show in 2004 three years later he had to flee the country in the wake of threats to his life sometimes it feels to me as if the odds that we will ever live in a world in which all men and women are free to live their lives without shame or suffering are long indeed and yet , as i drank my pint , i looked out the window at the great portland street station , where my younger self had waited for that girl 36 years ago , holding flowers she and i had walked that night through london after rain had fallen , mist rising up from the cobbles below our feet later i 'd put her in a taxi , and we placed our hands on either side of a rainstreaked window before the taxi drove off in the fog i 'd stood there in the mist for a long time , wondering if it was going to be impossible to love , or to be loved , in this life a clock in a nearby church had chimed the hour many of the lgbt people i meet continue to ask themselves variations on this question throughout their lives in my own case , it turned out that love would , in time , give me the courage to come out and live my truth a few years later i met the love of my life , deirdre finney , and she and i have spent 27 years together now 12 as husband and wife , 15 as wife and wife but not everyone is so lucky , in europe or in america and living one s life without fear or shame ought not to be a matter of luck , or of nationality all of us men and women , gay and straight , cis and trans deserve to be loved i finished my pint and walked out into the london evening the bell in the old church rang , and i stopped to listen to the sound i had heard it before
video recordings of police officers battering or even murdering unarmed black citizens have validated longstanding complaints by africanamericans and changed the way the country views the issue of police brutality police officers who might once have felt free to arrest or assault black citizens for no cause and explain it away later have been put on notice that the truth could be revealed by a cellphone video posted on the internet this kind of public scrutiny is all to the good , given the damage police brutality has done to africanamerican communities for generations and the corrosive effect it has on the broader society yet the peeling away of secrecy on these indisputably unconstitutional practices is now being challenged by politicians who want to softpedal or even ignore police misconduct while attacking the people who expose it or raise their voices in protest against it this trend is like something straight out of orwell gov chris christie of new jersey the increasingly desperate presidential candidate who is going nowhere fast took this posture when he accused president obama of encouraging lawlessness and violence against police officers by acknowledging that the country needed to take both police brutality and the protest movement seriously the president is absolutely right this movement focuses on the irrefutable fact that black citizens are far more likely than whites to die at the hands of the police the more the country ignores that truth , the greater the civic discord that will flow from it the of james comey , the director of the federal bureau of investigation , were not as racially poisonous as mr christie s , but they were no less incendiary in a speech at the university of chicago law school on friday , mr comey said that heightened scrutiny of police behavior and fear of appearing in viral videos was leading officers to avoid confrontations with suspects this , he said , may have contributed to an increase in crime there is no data suggesting such an effect , and certainly mr comey has none but his suggestion plays into the rightwing view that holding the police to constitutional standards endangers the public justice department officials who have made a top priority of prosecuting police departments for civil rights violations and who dispute that heightened scrutiny of the police drives up crime were understandably angry at mr comey s speculations his formulation implies that for the police to do their jobs , they need to have free rein to be abusive it also implies that the public would be safer if americans with cellphones never started circulating videos of officers battering suspects in the first place a day after mr comey made his remarks , the times published a into racial profiling and abusive police behavior in greensboro , nc , the thirdlargest city in the state after reviewing tens of thousands of traffic stops and years of arrest data , times reporters found that the police pulled over africanamerican drivers at a rate far out of proportion to their share of the local driving population the police searched black motorists or their cars twice as often as whites even though whites where significantly more likely to be caught with drugs and weapons greensboro police officers were more likely to pull black drivers over for no reason and more likely to use force if the driver was black , even when the driver offered no physical resistance a black greensboro man who nearly lost his job as a result of asking an officer why he was being ordered out of his car during a nightmarish encounter said every time i see a police officer , i get a cold chill even if i needed one , i would n't call one this is the kind of treatment that some americans routinely face at the hands of their police departments mr comey s speculations about alleged pressure on officers to stand down shows that he has n't begun to grasp the nature of the problem
imagine him in the last week of his life , 150 years ago this month shuffling , clothes hanging loosely on the 6foot4inch frame , that tinny voice , a face much older than someone of 56 i am a tired man , he said sometimes i think i am the tiredest man on earth springtime in washington , lilacs starting to flower the capitol dome finally free of its scaffolding his month began in triumph against the largest slaveholding nation on earth richmond fell and was set afire by its retreating residents on april 4 , , with his 12yearold son , tad his birthday ! walked the smoldering shell of the rebel capital , walked a mile or so , pressed by a throng of liberated blacks , to sit as a conqueror in the seat of the southern white house no day ever dawns for the slave , wrote a man who had once been owned by a fellow man in richmond , thereafter , all days had dawns on the dawn of his final day , april 14 , lincoln rises as usual at 7 am , breakfasts on coffee and an egg he meets with his cabinet , confers with an exslave , lunches with the unpredictable mary todd they have plans to attend our american cousin in the box at ford s theater that evening , a white supremacist fires a single shot from a derringer the bullet penetrates lincoln s brain and lodges just behind his right eye the most significant casualty in a war that took more lives than any other in the nation s history dies the next morning the first president to be murdered now think of the legacy on this anniversary of the american passion play think of free land for the landless , the transcontinental railroad , the seeding of what would grow into national parks , the granting of human rights to people who had none and think of how much the party of lincoln has turned against the expansive political philosophy of lincoln not the emancipation of four million people northern democrats who died on southern battlegrounds , and certainly the republicans who held power then , get their share of credit for ending the original sin of the united states but beyond could the republicans who control congress in 2015 , the party of no , ever pass a homestead act \? that law , which went into effect the very day , jan 1 , 1863 , lincoln s wartime executive order to free slaves in the breakaway states did , carries a clause that very few republicans would support now former slaves , famine irish , russian jews , single women , mexicans who did n't speak a word of english all qualified to claim 160 acres as their own you did n't have to be a citizen to get your quartersquaremile you just had to to become a citizen in that sense , the homestead act was the dream act of today it had a path to citizenship and prosperity for those in this country who were neither citizens nor prosperous consider the vision to stitch a railroad from east to west , an enormous tangle of infrastructure in 1862 , lincoln signed legislation spurring construction of the transcontinental railroad that same year , he approved a bill that led to the creation of land grant colleges today , congress will not even approve enough money to keep decrepit bridges from falling down , and has whittled away funds to help working kids stay in college it s laughable to think of republicans' approving of something visionary and forwardlooking in the realm of transportation , energy or education government , in their minds , can never be a force for good in 1864 , lincoln signed a bill that allowed california to protect the yosemite valley and the mariposa grove of giant sequoias wild land that would eventually become part of the national park system republicans of today are openly hostile to conservation , a largely republican idea the great , nationshaping accomplishments of lincoln s day happened only because the south , always with an eye on protecting slavery and an estateowning aristocracy , had left the union ridding congress of the naysayers today , the south is solidly republican and solidly obstructionist the party is also solidly white no , they 're not slaveapologists , though many fail to recognize the active , toxic legacy of the confederacy and no , their insults of president obama calling him a king , an incompetent , an outsider , echoing some of the slights against lincoln do not in any way make obama the lincoln of today but you can say this with certainty what unites the , on this 150th anniversary of the murder of lincoln , is that they are against the type of progressive legislation that gave rise to their party lincoln is an oil painting in the parlor , to be dusted off while republican leaders plot new ways to kill things that he would have approved of nothing in politics is static things will change party philosophies will flip , new alliances will emerge what we know for sure again comes from lincoln fellow citizens , we cannot escape history
back in the late 1980s , when i was a coeditor of spy magazine , we published a cover story about the 1970s spy being spy , it was a grand feast of lovehate celebration a return to the decade of mood rings , ultrasuede , sideburns and disco sexmachine tony orlando one of its implicit premises was the silliness of the pandemic of american nostalgia , especially for a culturally dubious decade that had ended less than a decade earlier over the last half century , we americans have come to create and consume automatically and continuously a kind of recentpast wistfulness but what about the 1990s \? nostalgia for the era in which you were young is almost inevitable , so people born between 1970 and 1990 feel a natural fetishistic fondness for that decade but even for the rest of us , the '90s provoke a unique species of , not mere bittersweet reveling in the passage of time no , looking back at the final 10 years of the 20th century is grounds for genuine mourning it was simply the happiest decade of our american lifetimes this is n't \( mainly \) fogeyishness on my part no it is empirically , objectively , broadly true i am not now nor have i ever been a clintonite , but when jeb bush reportedly said a few weeks ago , apropos of 2016 and the probable democratic presidential nominee , that if someone wants to run a campaign about '90s nostalgia , it s not going to be very successful , i think he was being wishful let s begin with the quantifiable bits america at large was prospering in the '90s the united states economy grew by an average of 4 percent per year between 1992 and 1999 \( since 2001 , it s never grown by as much as 4 percent , and since 2005 not even by 3 percent for a whole year \) an average of 17 million jobs a year were added to the american work force , versus around 850 , 000 a year during this century so far the unemployment rate dropped from nearly 8 percent in 1992 to 4 percent that is , effectively zero at the end of the decade plus , if you were a man and worked in an office , starting in the '90s you could get away with  from 1990 to 1999 , the median american household income grew by 10 percent since 2000 it s shrunk by nearly 9 percent the poverty rate peaked at over 15 percent in 1993 , then fell to nearly 11 percent in 2000 , more or less its postwar low during the '90s , stocks quadrupled in value the dow jones industrial average increased by 309 percent you could still buy a beautiful brooklyn townhouse for 500 , 000 or less and so on by the end of the decade , in fact , there was so much good news a surplus , dramatic reductions in violent crime \( the murder rate in the united states declined by 41 percent \) and in deaths from hiv aids that each astounding new achievement did n't quite register as miraculous after all , the decade had begun with a fantastically joyful and previously unimaginable development the soviet empire collapsed , global nuclear armageddon ceased to be a thing that worried anyone very much , and the nations of eastern europe were mostly unchained a tide of progress and good sense seemed to be sweeping the whole world according to the annual count by freedom house , the tally of the world s free countries climbed from 65 at the beginning of the decade to 85 at the end since then , the total number of certifiedfree countries has increased by only four between 1990 and 1994 south africa dismantled apartheid surprisingly peacefully with the oslo accords , israel and the palestine liberation organization had come together at last to negotiate a framework for coexistence and eventual peace the civil wars in the former yugoslavia ended and an enduring peace was restored china became normal , reforming its economy , tripling its gross domestic product and easing its way into the world order during the '90s , the only americanled war in the middle east was the one that drove saddam hussein s invading army out of kuwait with a ground campaign that lasted a mere 100 hours peace , prosperity , order and american culture was vibrant and healthy as well there were both shockingly excellent versions of what had come before and distinctly new , original forms was n't the release of nirvana s nevermind , in 1991 , pretty much the last time a new rock 'n' roll band truly , deeply mattered , the way rock 'n' roll did in the '60s and '70s \? was n't hiphop , which achieved its massmarket breakthrough and dominance in the '90s , the last genuinely new and consequential invention of american pop culture \? what is the most remarkably successful literary creation of the last several decades \? the novels , the first three of which appeared in the '90s supertalented literary youngsters appeared david foster wallace \( infinite jest \) , donna tartt \( the secret history \) , jonathan lethem \( motherless brooklyn \) and dave eggers \( mcsweeney s \) and supertalented literary geezers philip roth \( american pastoral \) , john updike \( rabbit at rest \) , alice munro \( the love of a good woman \) , don delillo \( underworld \) produced some of their best and most successful work as well the quality of television radically improved seinfeld and had their premieres in 1989 , and in the '90s they blew up , along with friends and nypd blue all of them broadcast network series , none of them reality shows hbo , before the '90s a channel for movies , boxing and softcore porn , decided to swing for the fences first with the larry sanders show and then with the sopranos , it proved that episodic television could accommodate major ambition and actual brilliance , ushering in an enduring new \( cable \) tv era in feature films , it was the decade of pulp fiction and the indie movement , thanks to which idiosyncratic , morecommercialthanarthouse masterpieces like those by wes anderson , alexander payne and richard linklater became plausible it was also the decade in which traditional disney animation came back from the dead and in which pixar , with the first two toy story movies , reinvented the form magnificently the digital age , of course , got fully underway in the '90s at the beginning of the decade almost none of us had heard of the web , and we did n't have browsers , search engines , digital cellphone networks , fully 3d games or affordable and powerful laptops by the end of the decade we had them all steve jobs returned to apple and conjured its rebirth and it was of technology by the end of the decade we all had cellphones , but not smartphones we were not overconnected or tyrannized by our devices social media had not yet made social life both manically nonstop and attenuated the digital revolution had n't brutally disrupted whole economic sectors and made their work forces permanently insecure recorded music sales nearly doubled during the decade newspapers and magazines were thriving even y2k , our terrifying endofthemillennium technological comeuppance , was a nonevent indeed , the '90s were a decade of catastrophes that did n't happen the clinton tax increases did not trigger a recession welfare reform did not ravage the poor compared with sandy , every hurricane that touched new york bob ! bertha ! danny ! dennis ! floyd ! was a dud were there real problems in the '90s \? of course but they were n't obvious , so we were blissfully ignorant ! almost none of us were suitably alarmed by carbon emissions and the warming planet according to a 1995 article in this newspaper about climate change , most scientists say the amount of warming so far , about one degree fahrenheit in the last century , is still too small to be distinguished from the climate system s natural fluctuations so why worry \? when the house and senate passed by overwhelming bipartisan majorities and president clinton signed the financial services modernization act of 1999 , doing away with the firewalls between investment banks and commercial banks , the change seemed inevitable , sensible , modern not a precursor of the 2008 wall street crash when a jihadist truck bomb detonated in the parking garage below the north tower of the world trade center in 1993 , we were alarmed only briefly , figuring it for a crazy oneoff rather than a first strike in a long struggle americans have never much liked paying attention to foreign countries and their problems \( see rwanda , 1994 \) , so the decade between the end of the cold war and the beginning of the war on terror was very much our cup of tea no i mean our cup of you ca n't talk about the '90s without talking about the sudden availability of excellent coffee espresso in idaho ! all over america this was thanks to starbucks , of course , which went from nearly 100 outlets in the united states at the start of the decade to 2 , 000 at the end but as it goes with so many good things in america easier credit and financial innovation and electronic connection and all the rest that just was n't enough today there are more than 13 , 000 starbucks in the united states and each of them , to my eye , looks exactly as it did when the rollout began 13 , 000 ubiquitous and faintly melancholic timecapsule museums of the last best american decade
yavoriv , ukraine the exercise , one of the most fundamental in the military handbook , came off without a hitch a soldier carrying a length of rope and a grappling hook ran to within 20 feet or so of a coil of concertina wire and stopped for a moment , he twirled the rope in his hands like a lasso , then threw the hook over the wire , and tugged hard , testing for explosives when nothing happened he signaled two comrades , who ran up and started snipping the wire with cutters although this was a typical training exercise for raw recruits in an elemental soldierly skill , there was nothing typical about the scene far from enlistees , these soldiers were regulars in the ukrainian national guard , presumably battlehardened after months on the front lines in eastern and the trainer was an american military instructor , drilling troops for battle with the united states' former cold war foe , russia , and russianbacked separatists it s been a long time since i heard a target called an ivan , first sgt david dzwik , one of the trainers , said in an interview out in the sunny forest , while observing the ukrainians run through drills now , i'm hearing it again the course on cutting wire is one of 63 classes of remedial military instruction being provided by 300 trainers in three consecutive twomonth courses here in western , they are far from the fighting , and their job is to instill some basic military knowhow in ukrainian soldiers , who the trainers have discovered are woefully unprepared the largely unschooled troops are learning such basic skills as how to use an encrypted walkietalkie how to break open a door with a sledgehammer and a crowbar and how to drag a wounded colleague across a field while holding a rifle at the ready when the war began a year ago , the ukrainian was all but worthless rife with corruption and russian spies , and made up largely of skeleton battalions of officers with just a few men about 1 percent of the equipment was manufactured in the past decade needless to say , morale was dismal one armored column in the early weeks of the civil war simply surrendered to a crowd of drunken local men rather than fight at that point , the defense minister estimated that there were at best 6 , 000 troops from a rapid reaction unit who were actually prepared for combat , out of the 130 , 000member army severely pressed , the government took to sending newly recruited national guard soldiers into combat after only two months of training they fumbled with their rifles , stumbled into traps and died from treatable wounds some learn in the classroom , some on the battlefield , col sergei moskalenko , the commander of the group now retraining at this base , said in an interview we had no other choice from the earliest days of the war , the government in kiev had asked for military help from the united states its request for a sophisticated antitank missile went nowhere , as washington feared it would just encourage russia to send more weapons and men to ukraine what eventually arrived was basic training the wirecutting drill was part of that on a recent spring day two weeks into the course , other similarly lowtech tips were being passed on bewildered ukrainian troops were being made to hoist one another on their backs , firefighter style , and run up a hill , part of an effort to improve the dismal mortality rate for the wounded the american instructors barked simple orders hurry up ! and keep moving ! duly rendered into ukrainian by interpreters the training aims to remold the ukrainian units by increasing the responsibilities of noncommissioned officers , fixing a soviet legacy of an officerheavy infantry without sergeants paying attention , basic mistakes were being made , the trainers said capt nicholas salimbene , an american trainer , noticed with alarm that the ukrainians were carrying their rifles with the safeties off it s about the professionalism of the force , he said we want them to look like soldiers you see reports about the little green men , he said , referring to the last year in unmarked uniforms , and they all walk around professionally , and carry their weapons professionally the ukrainians should , too , captain salimbene said the united states is also providing advanced courses for military professionals known as forward observers the ones who call in targets to improve the accuracy of artillery fire , making it more lethal for the enemy and less so for civilians oleksandr i leshchenko , the deputy director for training in the national guard , was somewhat skeptical about the value of the training , saying that 99 percent of the men in the course had already been in combat i do n't see anything new , in the american training courses , he said just a different approach the ukrainians , he said , had been squeezing a lot into their own twomonth boot camp , where the days were 28 hours long capt andrii syurkalo , a ukrainian officer , said it was commendable that the trainers were willing to use the as an element in a class on the  american officers described the course work as equivalent to the latter months of basic training in the united states the courses will train 705 ukrainian soldiers at a cost of 19 million over six months the ukrainian national guard is rotating from the front what units it can spare for the training american instructors intend to recommend top performers to serve as trainers within other ukrainian units , and in this way spread the instruction more broadly in the first two weeks of training , the americans found the ukrainians' soldierly skills lacking , and the group generally in need of instruction i came into it expecting them not to know much of the basics , said sgt michael faranda , who is teaching maneuvers he was correct things every soldier should know , he said , they did not some even forgot their helmets on the first day of exercises still , sergeant faranda said , the ukrainians' willingness to go into combat was all the more notable for their lack of preparation for it shaking his head , sergeant faranda said had he asked one group about the ukrainian procedure for handling a dud grenade he was told none existed they said , we just put it in our pocket , or throw it away'
the used semiautomatic rifles that were legally obtained despite that were intended to ban assault weapons and are widely regarded as among the strictest in the country the rifles were variants of the popular , the semiautomatic civilian version of a military m16 they are surprisingly easy to acquire in california , though they come with limitations aimed at curbing their ability to inflict mass damage semiautomatic rifles , for instance , cannot have magazines that hold more than 10 bullets or can be quickly removed however , such limitations can be easily , if illegally , bypassed for instance , a 10bullet magazine can be quickly removed by pressing the tip of a loose bullet into a recessed button , allowing for a highcapacity magazine to be inserted in its place this release feature called a bullet button is installed , legally , by gun manufacturers on rifles sold in california the highcapacity magazine is illegal in the state other restricted features , like pistol grips and folding stocks which allow greater control of the weapon while firing for a long period of time can also be added to some guns after their sale the police in san bernardino said thursday that the husbandandwife suspects , syed rizwan farook and tashfeen malik , had at least four highcapacity magazines and more than a thousand rounds of ammunition law enforcement specialists who briefed congressional officials on thursday said that mr farook bought two pistols legally and that another person bought the two 223caliber rifles a dpms a15 and smith wesson mp15 legally the weapons were purchased in 2011 and 2012 , but the briefers did not specify which were bought when it is not clear how those two guns ended up with the couple , and whether the seller complied with laws requiring that gun purchases go through a licensed dealer to ensure a background check is conducted despite california s relatively tough gun laws , it is not difficult to legally buy semiautomatic rifles that critics call assault weapons but are marketed by gun makers as modern sporting rifles , a long beach lawyer who has brought numerous legal challenges against gun ownership restrictions , said that none of these laws have proven to be effective there s a substitution effect , said mr michel , who counts among his clients the national rifle association if you ban rifle x , people will use rifle y when you strip away the prohibited features , you have a bare rifle , if you will , that is not necessarily a banned assault weapon go online , and it is not hard to find semiautomatic ar15style rifles offered for sale as california compliant this is despite a series of laws dating to 1989 that banned a number of specific brands , as well as certain generic features also , californians can still legally possess assault rifles that they owned before the prohibitions went into effect as long as they have registered them with the state more than 100 , 000 such weapons are registered the ban on highcapacity magazines , as well as the requirement that a magazine be affixed to the gun , was meant to prevent firing dozens of rounds from a single magazine and then quickly reloading , as has happened in many mass shooting cases the development of the took advantage of a provision in california law allowing the sale of a gun with a magazine that could be removed with a tool , rather than simply by pressing a releasecatch with a finger a bullet , for this purpose , is considered a tool because it can be pushed into the recessed button created by gun manufacturers in order to continue selling semiautomatic rifles legally in california , said lindsay nichols , a senior lawyer at the law center to prevent gun violence , based in san francisco it s a big problem , she said the intent of the legislature was clearly to prohibit assault weapons , but the gun manufacturers have exploited a loophole in the law it means that a whole set of guns that should be banned in california are still available gun makers argue that the bullet button was approved by state officials in 2000 and should not be viewed as a loophole rather , it was simply the industry trying to comply with the state of california s law and regulations in order to continue selling a popular firearm , according to the national shooting sports foundation , which represents manufacturers
the ' union with yoenis cespedes seems certain to be brief cespedes , the slugging outfielder acquired for two prospects on friday , is a free agent after this season the mets have three other outfielders signed for 2016 and an aversion to the kind of lavish deal cespedes will command of course , none of that matters now cespedes is the mets' shiny rental car from detroit , no less with very specific instructions plugged into his gps the destination is the playoffs , where the mets have not been since 2006 if cespedes leads them there , the purpose of the deal will be fulfilled that might not make the trade a longterm success the boston red sox made the playoffs in 1990 , helped by 22 strong innings down the stretch from a rented reliever , larry andersen but the red sox won no games in the postseason , andersen left as a free agent , and the prospect they traded , jeff bagwell , starred for the houston astros for the next 15 seasons many inseason deals are not such obvious rentals , because the player stays with his new team for a while the mets acquired first baseman donn clendenon at the old june trade deadline , in 1969 , and clendenon went on to be most valuable player of their first world series championship he spent two more years with the mets for pure rentals , like cespedes will probably be , think of players who left as free agents after one partial season mark langston with the 1989 montreal expos randy johnson with the 1998 houston astros and cliff lee with the 2010 texas rangers come to mind or you could simply take inventory of some folks around the current yankees three players and a broadcaster embody different levels of rental success ultimate success david cone , a yankees broadcaster , was traded from the mets to toronto in august 1992 cone stayed just long enough to make 11 starts , including the world series clincher , helping the blue jays win their first championship losing jeff kent , a future superstar , in the trade was a small price to pay for a title limited success carlos beltran , the yankees' right fielder , landed in houston when his first team , the royals , traded him in june 2004 beltran smoked 23 homers for the astros in the regular season , then hit 435 with eight homers in the postseason he cost two longtime major leaguers , octavio dotel and john buck , but nearly delivered the first pennant in astros history , falling one game short which was exactly as far as he would carry the mets , who signed him before the next season accidental success mark teixeira , the yankees' first baseman , went from atlanta to the angels in 2008 for the low price of casey kotchman and a minor leaguer teixeira hit 358 to help win a division title for the angels , who had no idea how big a victory it would be when teixeira signed with the yankees the angels were awarded the yankees' firstround pick the next june and used it to draft an outfielder from millville , nj , named mike trout a side note to that story is that the milwaukee brewers nearly had the yankees' pick the brewers had traded for cleveland s c c sabathia , who helped them to their first playoff berth in 26 years and then signed with the yankees in free agency the problem for the brewers was that the yankees also signed teixeira , who was rated higher than sabathia under arcane compensation rules that have since been abolished so the yankees forfeited their firstround choice to the angels , instead , and gave their secondround choice to the brewers milwaukee used that pick to draft max walla , a high school outfielder from albuquerque he peaked at class a in 2013 , made a brief conversion to pitcher in 2014 , and is now out of baseball trout , of course , is the best player in the game two games last wednesday underscored the folly of the boston red sox' handling of jon lester last season boston made a belowmarket bid to resign lester last spring \( four years , 70 million \) , then traded him to oakland on july 31 for yoenis cespedes the red sox flipped cespedes to detroit in the winter for starter rick porcello , and signed him in april to a wildly abovemarket contract \( four years , 825 million \) through 2019 essentially , then , the red sox replaced lester with porcello at 26 , porcello is five years younger than lester but he has not been a better fit porcello is a groundball pitcher , and the red sox expected him to thrive with strong defense behind him instead , porcello has been among the worst starters in the majors last wednesday , he gave up 10 hits and five earned runs in two innings , pushing his earned run average to 581 the same day , lester allowed two runs in eight innings while striking out 14 for the chicago cubs lester had a 166 era in six july starts , lowering his season mark to 326 he is in the first year of a sixyear , 155 million contract more than twice the value of the initial deal he rejected from boston  one preseason narrative that never panned out

fla , was 5 , and morse , from davie , was 11 upper tank , over first base , looking down , morse said earlier this season i remember charlie hough was pitching they gave out an inaugural magazine i still have it this is stuff my mom always kept they really did n't have bobbleheads then , so they had balls with players' faces on them , and my mom put it all in a bin when i signed here , i was thinking , i think i 've got that bin' i went to the garage and opened it up , and it was like marlins galore newspaper articles , a jacket , a bag , all this cool stuff alas , the memorabilia from this season may not stir the same warm memories morse , who drove in the winning run in game 7 of the world series for the giants last fall , has been injured and batted just 213 for miami he was traded to the dodgers with latos , who was 47 with a 448 era , for three prospects the dodgers then shipped morse to pittsburgh for outfielder jose tabata  when his career is over , shane victorino

chicago nneka jones tapia , who runs the sprawling cook county jail here , has an indelible childhood memory of police officers pounding on the aluminum walls of the family s doublewide trailer home in north carolina , riffling through cupboards and drawers , and arresting her father on charges of selling marijuana dr jones tapia , then 8 , had to call her mother home from work over the next several years , other relatives , including two brothers , and a number of friends also spent time in jail she says she might have ended up there , too instead , she became fascinated by psychology and earned a doctorate she began working at cook county jail in 2006 , and this spring became its unlikely warden when she was promoted to executive director one of the first clinical psychologists to run a jail , underscoring how much the country s prisons have become holding centers for the mentally ill it s a national disgrace how we deal with this , said sheriff thomas dart , who appointed dr jones tapia to the post and who refers to the jail , a place notorious for its history of violence and overcrowding , as the largest mental institution in the country he said that as many as onethird of the jail s 8 , 600 inmates were mentally ill as she sat in a cellblock one day recently , dr jones tapia , 37 , reflected i know all too well what it s like to hope that your loved ones make better decisions and i think about my own life and how i was probably one bad decision away from being in a correctional institution myself as congress including giving judges greater discretion in sentencing jails and prisons are also confronting myriad problems in dealing with the mentally ill there are now 10 times as many mentally ill people in the nation s 5 , 000 jails and prisons as there are in state mental institutions , according to a last year by the national sheriffs' association and the treatment advocacy center , a nonprofit group that supports expanded access to treatment such inmates are far more likely to be kept in solitary confinement and to be beaten by guards and other inmates , corrections officials say some wardens complain that their jails have become little more than makeshift mental asylums , and that they lack the money and expertise needed to deal with the problem three of the nation s largest jails rikers island in new york , the county jail in los angeles and cook county jail here in chicago have been under federal scrutiny , in part because of mistreatment of the mentally ill in los angeles and , the jails are already operating under federal oversight , and cook county has become a model of sorts for other troubled institutions in how to deal with the mentally ill before becoming warden , dr jones tapia oversaw care at the jail , and under her guidance , cook county began offering services that would have been unthinkable a few years ago all inmates upon arrival now see a clinician who collects a history to ensure that anyone who is mentally ill gets a proper diagnosis and receives medication the jail then forwards that information to judges in time for arraignments in the hope of convincing them that in certain cases , mental health care may be more appropriate than jail the jail also enrolls arriving inmates in plans , then helps arrange basic case management upon their release we 've started to focus on the entirety of the system , from the point of arrest through discharge , and really forcing the whole system to take a look at the people that we 're incarcerating , dr jones tapia said officials have also discussed using a sheriff s department van staffed with a therapist to perform house checks on former inmates , and if necessary , drive them to medical appointments to ensure that prescriptions are refilled on time , in an attempt to prevent them from turning to illegal drug use or other crimes that would send them back to jail sheriff dart , who has led the push for change here , says the jail has become a dumping ground for people who should not be locked up the person is n't choosing to be schizophrenic , he said the vast majority of mentally ill people are here for nonviolent crimes , like stealing food to survive or breaking into places , usually looking for somewhere to sleep , or getting caught with drugs because they are selfmedicating how is it different than us locking up diabetics \? jails were never meant to be mental health hospitals to press ahead with the jail s overhaul , sheriff dart promoted dr jones tapia in may we were looking for someone who could do the baseline things , he said , but who also had this other vision still , she is an unusual choice sheriff jim mcdonnell of los angeles county said a warden s job was typically focused on security , although he acknowledged that having psychological expertise might prove useful i certainly think the more tools you bring to the table , the better , sheriff mcdonnell said but you are running a giant operation , and you need to keep things moving , to focus on security , to keep the staff motivated dr jones tapia said that the whole time she worked at the jail as a psychologist , she had made a point of hanging out with corrections officers , and that had eased the transition to her new post i think they welcomed the opportunity to share their world , and many of them , when they see me today , say , i know you 're going to be all right because we taught you well , ' she said she also ended up marrying a corrections officer , angel tapia , a 12year veteran of the jail cook county jail , though determined to improve conditions , remains a difficult place for inmates like nearly every large jail or prison in the country , it is riven by the same gang rivalries that plague the streets the most violent and dangerous inmates are separated from others as they await trials or transfers to prison while the jail is far less crowded today than a few years ago , inmates those who are mentally ill and others who are not complain that they have too little personal space and too little time to exercise , and that courts take too long to resolve their cases , many of which are for minor drug , traffic or theft charges the vast majority of inmates are africanamerican or latino some portions of the jail date to the 1920s and are falling apart in places leaking ceilings are dealt with by placing clumps of rags on the floor to absorb water walls and floors are cracking , and paint is peeling in bathrooms , long rows of toilets a few feet apart lack partitions for privacy inmates have little to do all day , so they stand in front of television sets watching game shows and the news , or lie in their bunks and sleep for dr jones tapia , the path to becoming warden was not direct after earning an undergraduate degree in psychology from the university of north carolina , she said , she had no clear idea what to do next she worked as a receptionist and in community mental health care before beginning to take more specialized psychology courses and going on to earn a doctorate from the  the program she is most proud of and the centerpiece of efforts to overhaul the jail is the mental health transition center , which started last august and was run by dr jones tapia before she became warden five days a week , a group of about 15 inmates with mental illnesses like , and , receive cognitive behavioral therapy , job readiness skills and extra recreation the warden said such inmates who were released without such services were often back within weeks as they amassed dozens , even hundreds , of arrests for petty crimes like shoplifting and drug possession because they were unable to obtain the prescription drugs needed to treat their condition many are rearrested just to receive treatment , so upon their release , inmates are now given a two weeks' supply of medication if somebody does n't have access to the basic tools to survive , they 're more likely to recommit a crime and come back , dr jones tapia said so we know it s not just a mental health problem it s more of a wellbeing problem none of the 43 former inmates who attended the program before being released have been rearrested , said ben breit , a jail spokesman one of those former inmates , demetrius members , 23 , who has been arrested 18 times , mostly for selling drugs , said he had recently been told that he had a severe case of in which he had nearly constant thoughts of suicide mr members said that he had frequently used pcp and alcohol , which helped chase away negative thoughts , but that now , with the help of medication and counseling , he had enough confidence to envision a day when he would be able to open his own business , marry and become a homeowner i hate i had to come to jail to learn this , he said , but who would have thought a program like this would be in a jail \?

drafted into the in 2013 , 30 of his objects appeared in the venice biennale , prominently displayed with 36 anonymous tantric paintings , also small , in a perfect harmony of intuitive shape and saturated color now , mr nagle , who had his first solo show in san francisco , his hometown , in 1968 , and his first in new york in 1981 , is undergoing another rite of passage the stunning , exquisitely installed rollout at a bluechip gallery , in chelsea not surprisingly seems to be knocking off socks right and left half of the show s nearly two dozen pieces radiate from individual vitrines the remainder combust in tiffanywindowstyle wall niches , finished with blond wood never more than a few inches high , these pieces fill , figuratively speaking , three large spaces most are recent or finished this year , showing mr nagle in top form a few earlier ones remind us that this is only the tip of a very large iceberg that has yet to be examined in full four dark bronze vessels from 1991 allude to mr nagle s obsession with the teacup , whose elements bowl , volume , handle he kept in abstract rotation for years \( you can see a vestige of a teacup handle in the whiplash strand of new blue larue , from 2008 , which morphs into a central protagonist in several more recent works here \) there are also nine drawings on sheets of brightly colored notebook paper their stacked shapes could be prototypes for gourmet desserts and make excellent use of a goldleafing pen and the blazing white correction fluid once familiar to typists mr nagle seems to have little truck with the terms ceramist , ceramic artist or ceramic sculptor none encompass his wizardry his bonsais are hybrids of exquisitely contrasting forms , surfaces , colors and sometimes materials , including styrene and rotocast urethane these works represent a hybrid life mr nagle has been from the start almost as serious about music as art he has belonged to several bay area rock bands \( the mystery trend , the fast bucks and the durocs \) artists as diverse as leo kottke , barbra streisand and the jefferson airplane have either recorded songs by or with mr nagle and often his longtime music collaborator scott mathews and mr nagle s 1970 solo album , bad rice , has been followed this year by precooked converted the bad rice demos mr nagle is primarily a lyricist , a talent that carries over into his art most directly in the titles of his objects lamb shank redemption , centaur of attention , and beirut canal sometimes ludicrous puns that often illuminate their victims unexpectedly centaur of attention , for example , features one of the attenuated , modeled shapes , this one in pale gray and resembling an inverted tree branch , that recoils in alarm , like one of

close friend and surfing buddy was ken price , based in los angeles another ceramic great whose public profile was considerably heightened by this gallery both artists siphoned some ideas from california funk and finish fetish like mr price , mr nagle committed to working small by around 1960 his primary inspirations were giorgio morandi s small paintings and several forms of japanese art , especially tea bowls it took him a few more years to smooth things out and achieve the refined delicacy he has maintained ever since this delicacy exceeds mr price s \( whose efforts can seem immense next to mr nagle s \) it is also implicitly narrative and emotionally tense , thanks to all the contrasts mr nagle builds into his work this tension is especially evident in ryder s sky , a homage to

washington how can you maintain fame if people ca n't say your name \? this is one question that might have occurred to the 16thcentury dutch artist joachim wtewael if he had cared about lasting fame , which , apparently , he only sometimes did over the span of his wellcushioned life in utrecht , wtewael pronounced , approximately , ootuhvawl \( even the dutch have a hard time with it \) seems to have paid more attention to selling flax and buying stocks than he did to making art , even though art was his first calling and did bring him local renown none of this would matter if he had been a mediocrity but he was n't he was one of the great dutch artists of the years leading up to the 17thcentury golden age and it s at least in part a measure of his personal diffidence that called pleasure and piety the art of joachim wtewael \( 15661638 \) at the national gallery of art here is the first survey of his career comfortable in scale 37 paintings and some drawings , roughly a third to a half of his known output it brings a major figure into view and it demonstrates both what was brilliant and what was confusing about a man who could think like a devil and paint like an angel wtewael was born in utrecht , the child of an artist after training with his father , he traveled in france and italy for several journeyman years in the process , he adopted late mannerism as his preferred style , one primary influence being the work of the belgian artist bartholomeus spranger , who lived at the hapsburg court in prague but whose prints were distributed everywhere whatever his sources , wtewael had fully absorbed the style s defining traits distorted figures , weird colors , an eroticized atmosphere by the time he painted one of the show s earliest pictures , judith with the head of holofernes , dated between 1595 and 1600 it depicts the moment of calm triumph just after the israelite heroine has seduced and killed an assyrian army general who threatened her people with her wrestler s neck , greentinged flesh and robes of lightbleached lavender and gold , judith fills the canvas like a massive machine of fate , one mollusklike hand resting , almost teasingly , on the dead man s severed head , the other wrapped around the hilt of his sword the image is pure opera the diva accepts an ovation it may also have a symbolic meaning relevant to the dutch war of independence from spain that was then underway , and to local politics utrecht held a conflicted position in the spanish struggle the city was traditionally dominated by a roman catholic aristocracy , which remained powerful even after the netherlands had become officially protestant and republican although wtewael was probably born catholic , by the time he painted judith he had become an orthodox calvinist and was beginning to play an active role , as part of the protestant resistance , in the city s rule he was certainly one of its model citizens in 1595 , he married and started a family his flax business was thriving he was speculating in real estate he would soon buy shares in the fledgling dutch east india company , a very smart move in 1601 , when he was 34 , he painted a splendid selfportrait , with a matching portrait of his wife , christina they hang together , literally pictures of success , in the show s first gallery they are like advertisements for the burgher ideal two handsome , composed , alertlooking 1 percenters , dressed in the fashionable quietmoney uniform of black silk with white ruffs interestingly , although art was not , by this point , wtewael s primary source of income , he depicts himself as a painter , holding a palette in one hand and a poised brush in the other the red pigment on its tip , the color of passion , is a significant touch so is the design of a family coat of arms included in the selfportrait he inscribes a sobersounding personal motto beneath it not glory but remembrance but the crest itself is flanked by two barechested , goatfooted satyrs , their bodies coiled as if they were about to hop up and dash away the satyrs , classical emblems of unbridled lust , like the bloodred paint on the brush , are revealing they introduce a puzzling , provocative , even perverse note into what otherwise appears to be a conventional context and once you start to spend time with wtewael s art , we realize that that s fundamentally how it works you rarely know exactly where he s coming from , what his attitude toward a subject is , or what discomfiting surprise he s going to spring on you art history does n't like confusion no wonder he has n't been canonized what , for example , can we make of an ostensibly religious painting like the martyrdom of saint sebastian from 1600 \? the theme is old the saint , a roman soldier , has been condemned to death by the emperor diocletian for being a christian he is to be tied to a tree and executed by a firing squad of imperial archers in most paintings of the story , the arrows have been fired , and he s been left to die the image has always offered painters a rare religious pretext for painting an idealized male nude but wtewael barely bothers with the pretext at all no arrows have been shot sebastian is barely tied up he stands all but nude , flexing and preening , as his loincloth slips down his thighs he s performing a striptease and he has a rapt audience a naked , redfaced male angel who floats overhead , arms and legs wide , as if about to jump him what s going on \? is this a religious image intended for devotion \? is it a sendup of such an image , reflecting a calvinist disparagement of a cult of the saints \? a commissioned exercise in soft porn \? one thing s for sure paintingwise , it s exquisite so are wtewael s more forthrightly pornographic paintings of a scene from ovid s metamorphoses in which the divine lovers mars and venus are caught in flagrante by venus s husband as the rest of olympus looks on the lovemaking is explicit enough to have kept two images out of public view for centuries , and until fairly recently in museum deep storage these pictures have another feature in common , too they 're done in oil paint on copper panels , a medium with which wtewael particularly excelled the size of the precious panels inspired him to work in extreme , singlehairbrush detail , and to attempt radical feats of compression in the wedding of cupid and psyche from 16011603 , he packs dozens of minute figures into a sixbyeightinch span , with enough variety of incident , pose , mood and brushwork to fill several paintings many times the size plus there s something about oil on copper that is especially sensual in an adam and eve from around 1610 , the glowing biscuitbrown bodies of the stillinnocent couple look luscious enough to eat but just when you think his pictures are going down easy , he gives you something sharp on the tongue in a scene called the kitchen maid from the early 1620s , he seems to be leaving mannerism and testing out the pictorial naturalism , domestic subject matter and moralizing commentary that would characterize the next phase in dutch art in the foreground we see a young maid preparing for an elaborate meal in the background the new testament scene of jesus talking with the sisters martha and mary is in progress the intention is clear to link worldly events to divine events , to find the sacred in the everyday but the everyday here is a nightmare the kitchen is a slaughterhouse a big , fatty haunch of raw meat sits on a table disemboweled fish lie stacked on a plate the cooleyed maid , her hands red with blood , her cheeks flushed , impales plucked chickens on an iron pole is wtewael inviting us to be grossedout by an image of food handling so avid as to feel sexually charged \? i do n't know , but i do know that the image makes perfect sense as a sardonic comment on the realities of food culture today maybe it s wtewael s moral slipperiness , or ambiguity , that still keeps him fresh and disconcertingly modern from what we can gather , he finally stopped painting when christina died in 1629 , and died himself a few years later , honored as a citizen , considered oldfashioned as an artist his work disappeared into family attics and museum vaults the current show organized by liesbeth m helmus of the centraal museum utrecht james clifton of the museum of fine arts , houston and arthur k wheelock jr of the national gallery of art , with anne w lowenthal as a consulting scholar does a real service in bringing him back , difficult name , confounding ideas , and all it gives us an artist to puzzle over and delight in , and it gives wtewael what he may only sometimes have thought to wish for glory remembrance both
hanover , nh surveying the aftermath of the terror attacks in paris , most americans probably feel despair , and a presentiment that it is only a matter of time before something similar happens here even as americans have felt the pain of the french , they have worried , not surprisingly , considering 9 11 , about whether their country is next but such anxiety is unwarranted in fact , it s a mistake to assume that america s security from terrorism at home is comparable to europe s for many reasons , the united states is a significantly safer place while vigilance remains essential , no one should panic the slaughter in france depended on four things easy access to paris , european citizens happy to massacre their compatriots , a eurojihadist infrastructure to supply weapons and security agencies that lacked resources to monitor the individuals involved these are problems the united states does not have at least not nearly to the degree that europe does , undermining its ability to defend itself american policy makers have eyed europe s external border controls skeptically for many years the schengen rules , which allow for free bordercrossing inside most of the european union , have made life simple for criminals complicating matters is the ease with which a terrorist might slip out of syria , cross through turkey and enter greece and the european union , as at least one of the paris killers appears to have done counterterrorism often boils down to a search for a few individuals , and the chaos surrounding the flood of refugees a record 218 , 000 entered the european union just last month has exacerbated the difficulty of keeping track of such incoming security threats but the united states does n't have this problem pretty much anyone coming to the united states from middle eastern war zones or the radical underground of europe would need to come by plane , and , since 9 11 , we have made it tough for such people to fly to the united states and it helps that america s two immediate neighbors , mexico and canada , have extremely cooperative security authorities , which prevents wouldbe terrorists from slipping across our land borders then there s the domestic challenge it appears the paris attacks involved both middle eastern operatives and muslims from france and belgium but some highprofile exceptions aside , american muslims are much less attracted to the islamic state and its ideology than european muslims seem to be americans have traveled to isiscontrolled territories at a rate of roughly a third that of their european union coreligionists yes , some of the worst attacks of recent years here at home have been by deeply alienated muslims , including nidal hasan , the fort hood shooter , and the tsarnaev brothers , perpetrators of the boston marathon bombing but the incidence of such malcontents is lower than in europe , whose larger muslim communities , social science data shows , are markedly less integrated although european governments have been working to ameliorate grievances , european muslims remain poorer , more ghettoized and more discriminated against than american muslims , whose levels of education and income mirror those of the entire american population we should be thankful for the paucity of american extremists , given our superabundance of weapons the islamic state s innovation over its predecessors from al qaeda , who relished the drama of bomb strikes , is indiscriminate attacks with firearms many of the guns are from government stocks in places like libya and syria , which has changed the equation in formerly gunfree europe the united states has another advantage an intelligence , law enforcement and bordercontrol apparatus that has been vastly improved since the cataclysm of 9 11 post9 11 visa requirements and nofly lists weed out most bad actors , and both the bush and obama administrations demanded that countries in our visa waiver program provide data on extremists through informationsharing pacts called hspd6 agreements improvements continue , like an advance passenger information passenger name recognition agreement with the european union of 2012 in fact , america has spent more than 650 billion since 9 11 on homeland security , or around 47 billion a year in contrast , after the charlie hebdo killings , france announced a multiyear 786 million effort to combat terrorism the annual budget for germany s entire intelligence service is 660 million the resulting gaps in france s counterterror regime are selfevident already , there are indications that the paris crew operated undetected because of surveillance shortcomings , as was true with the charlie hebdo attacks none of this should lead american authorities , or the american people , to settle into a false sense of security the foremost task for the years ahead is to double down on our intelligence collection and press our european partners to dramatically expand theirs if anything , what the paris attacks show is that the world needs america s intelligence and security resources even more than its military might the american intelligence community is the indispensable hub of global counterterrorism efforts , but the large numbers and geographic spread of the islamic state mean that the united states must commit even more resources europe must step up and help build the basis for a deeper , more farreaching collaboration europe , already disadvantaged by geography , has to try a lot harder it s a daunting but not insurmountable challenge , and america must be ready to help , for europe s sake and its own

the new york times sports department asked some writers around the newsroom for predictions here they are , both serious and whimsical despite 11 home runs from daniel murphy , the lose the opener when terrance gore scores the winning run from first on a wild pitch that never leaves the batter s box seven shutout innings from jacob degrom and seven more homers from murphy help the mets leave kansas city with a split early in game 3 , sandy alderson negotiates a trade to send wilmer flores to seattle the deal is scuttled when the crowd at citi field begins a kickstarter campaign to keep flores , who , after asking the homeplate umpire for a tissue , drills the gamewinning homer in the ninth kansas city roars back to win games 4 and 5 , and afterward , ned yost praises his pitching staff for holding murphy to only five homers champagne is wheeled into the ' clubhouse after they score twice in the eighth in game 6 to go ahead , 53 the mets , down to their final out and with no one on base , go on to score three times , including the winning run on a muffed grounder by first baseman eric hosmer buoyed by that victory , the mets edge the royals , 85 , in game 7 even though murphy finishes the series with 32 homers , matt harvey is selected as the most valuable player because voters , 29 years after the mets' last title , feel like honoring another knight harvey almost misses the ceremony because he has to make deadline for the players' tribune october means that fans are subjected to much silly talk about what parts of baseball matter more now in truth , there are only a few important differences between the playoffs and regular season top pitchers a team s best three starters and two relievers can combine for almost 90 percent of innings in a world series that s an advantage for the mets , who by some measures have three of baseball s top 25 starters the royals have none temporary players both teams will rely on players who spent much of the season hurt or elsewhere yoenis cespedes , travis d'arnaud , steven matz , johnny cueto and ben zobrist this factor roughly cancels out tactics managers are more creative in the playoffs , which means they 're more important ned yost of the royals seems to be a master motivator , but game strategy is not his strong suit how does it all add up \? the postseason factors favor the mets but mostly serve to close the gap with the royals , who were better over the course of 2015 this series is a tossup , and the betting markets agree i 'll go with the royals in seven games the mets in four daniel murphy hits a grand slam every time he bats , catches every ball within a 100yard radius and becomes speaker of the house of representatives , thus averting a government shutdown all the pizzaeating rats immigrate to kansas city whatever the outcome , i can confidently predict that ticket prices at this world series will be extremely high according to data from , average resale prices for tickets to games 3 , 4 and 5 , to be played at citi field , are 1 , 128 , 1 , 089 and 1 , 150 those are averages of completed transactions , not of list prices , which can be inflated by optimistic sellers these games are set to be the most expensive world series contests since seatgeek started tracking ticket prices in 2010 , except one game 6 of the 2013 world series , when the red sox won the title over the cardinals tickets for that game averaged 1 , 175 but there s still time for the mets to set a price record , driven by fans who may fear this will be the last chance of their lives to see the team win a world series the royals are one out from winning the world series in game 6 when a wild pitch scores the tying run then a slow roller slides through the legs of first baseman eric hosmer and scores the winner for the miracle mets so predictable alas , in a karmic and tonsorial twist , the mets blow a late lead in game 7 when a batted ball gets tangled in pitcher jacob degrom s hair , clearing the bases for the royals could it be that in a world series with many rich story lines and intriguing subplots , the most fascinating character is a manager \? consider ned yost , who used to spend his winters working as a taxidermist yost entered professional baseball with the mets a firstround draft pick , he was dispatched on his first assignment to batavia , ny , for low class a ball there were like 16 of us living in a twobedroom house , and they had a pay phone on the front porch , yost said that s how you called home once a week yost got around town on a bike that he bought for 10 i was driving to the ballpark one day , and i popped a wheelie , and the front tire shot off , he said i took a header this may explain some of his managing decisions yost doggedly sticks with alcides escobar as his leadoff hitter because of a peculiarly complex metric the team wins yost loads his bench with pinchrunners , not pinchhitters and when he brought in closer wade davis too late and then too early in game 6 against toronto , it worked out , because it always does so even if daniel murphy is in an ungodly groove , and matt harvey , noah syndergaard and jacob degrom seem untouchable , they will meet their match in the machinations of an original mr met mets get yosted royals in six game 1 a hard slide to break up a double play leads to a benchclearing brawl game 2 a retaliatory beanball leads to a benchclearing brawl game 3 a provocative bat flip leads to a benchclearing brawl game 4 a violation of an unwritten rule of baseball that no one is quite clear on leads to a benchclearing brawl game 5 a benchclearing brawl erupts while an earlier , totally unrelated benchclearing brawl is still going on game 6 a knockdown , dragout , hotdogtossing benchclearing brawl causes commissioner rob manfred to proclaim the day the darkest in baseball history since the black sox you 'd watch game 7 , right \? i'm an easy mark , being a kansas city native living in new york my doormen , bartenders , colleagues even the dads at my kid s school want to bet me that the mets are going to beat my royals in the world series i like action as much as the next guy , and i knowthe royals will take them in six games but folks , you 've got to come up with better stakes i'm putting up kc barbecue , a hardtoget , meltinyourmouth higher art form you 're countering with bagels , pizza or cheesecake \? really \? beer your brooklyn lager versus my boulevard \? ughugh , no deal steaks , same thing kc strips trump new york ones wine \? if you were the bordeaux mets , maybe last call bryant s , gates and oklahoma joe s are all on the table make me an offer please i should pick against the mets i'm not superstitious , except when i am , which is to say always around my sports teams sometimes , when i watch a game on my dvr , i remind myself i can shift position on the couch because this game was actually played hours earlier and my movement ca n't affect the cosmic currents backing way up , like peering through the hubble telescope at a distant galaxy , i see closely matched teams the royals are fast and fun , and i dig that they are apostates , violating the laws of sabermetrics they do not deify the base on balls , and they believe in making contact \( there , i 've davened toward the royals have i covered myself \? \) i'm a lifelong mets fan , traversing many dark valleys and seeing a few brilliant peaks as the writer joe flaherty said , loving the mets is not a rational thing this team has brilliant young arms , which call to mind the holy trinity of seaver , koosman and ryan they have a likable shortstop by accident and a second baseman transmogrified into rogers hornsby my pick \? i am going to assume that the moon is in the seventh house and jupiter is aligned with mars and pick mets in seven , as jeurys familia strikes out someone with the bases loaded my home office sits just a modest zip line away from john s big deck , a popular kansas city watering hole even when i do n't have my tv turned to a royals playoff game , i can always tell how they 're doing by the silence \( bad \) or exhilaration \( good \) emanating from john s last year , i made the unfortunate mistake of choosing game 7 of the world series to make my first trip to john s the reaction when the royals lost \? let s just say that i was glad i took off right as the giants' pablo sandoval got ready to catch the popup that ended the game so my prediction like any good journalist s will be based on what s best for me another year of socloseyetsofar sullenness from the royals' faithful \? or a year of braggadocio from a people who are , otherwise , modest and down home \? well , i am a fan of the rival detroit tigers , and like most journalists , i prefer covering reactions of despair and disbelief so it s got to be mets in six , right \? kansas city is a smallermarket team with a marginally higher payroll than that of the budgetconscious mets , and the more heartrending story after years of spendthrift futility , the royals have been painstakingly built by general manager dayton moore , who grew up a fan of the team in wichita , kan , and watched it win the world series in 1985 from the i70 ramp overlooking the stadium now named for ewing kauffman , the team s founding owner the spirit of the beloved mr k will carry the royals over the mets in six those poor kansas city royals they 're about to lose their second world series in two years i ca n't imagine they 'll go quietly their lineup is too good for that but they will go good pitching beats good hitting , the way paper covers rock harvey , degrom , syndergaard any one of them would be ace of the royals' staff also , daniel murphy is lou gehrig , only with a little more pop and even if he suddenly becomes daniel murphy again , he has plenty of teammates \( david wright , lucas duda , yoenis cespedes \) who are due to return to form grim , cavernous shea stadium has been destroyed bernard l madoff is in jail bobby bonilla is finally off the payroll \( or not \) it is time for the mets to exorcise the demons of 2006 , and 2007 and 2008
washington even as the authorities say they remain uncertain what precisely led a gunman to attack a facility in colorado springs on friday , a comment attributed to the suspect by a senior law enforcement official no more baby parts fed directly into an already highpitched controversy over planned parenthood and its practices the phrase was an eerie echo of language used by politicians here and in many state capitals since an antiabortion group began releasing its undercover videos of planned parenthood officials discussing possible donations of fetal tissue for medical research congressional supporters and opponents of planned parenthood were uncharacteristically subdued over the weekend as they awaited more information about the shooting , which killed three people and wounded nine , so it was unclear how the episode might affect congress s yearend agenda after lawmakers return on monday from their holiday recess but considering the extent to which planned parenthood has fomented political passions on both the left and the right in washington , that restraint seems unlikely to hold long before friday , planned parenthood was expected to be prominent in the debate over legislation to finance federal operations , which the republicancontrolled congress must pass before dec 11 to keep the government open antiabortion conservatives want republican leaders to let the government shut down unless president obama agrees to end reimbursements to planned parenthood for health services to lowincome patients \( these services do not include abortions , because federal law bans payment for most abortions \) five congressional committees have been investigating planned parenthood since a californiabased antiabortion group called the center for medical progress in july started posting 11 videos online , one at a time over several months , purporting to show that planned parenthood was trafficking in baby parts for profit planned parenthood has denied that resigned as house speaker days after creating a special committee to investigate planned parenthood , other abortion providers and tissue procurement businesses his decision to quit was forced by hardline conservatives' credible threat to unseat him for refusing to lead a government shutdown over planned parenthood funding his successor , representative of wisconsin , did not address the shootings over the weekend but a spokesman , brendan buck , said on sunday that the tragedy would not change the investigating committee s plans on saturday , senator barbara boxer , democrat of california , called on mr ryan to disband the special house committee investigating planned parenthood it is time to stop the demonizing and witch hunts against planned parenthood , its staff and patients , and the lifesaving health care it provides to millions every day , she said representative marsha blackburn , republican of tennessee , the chairwoman of what is called the select investigative panel on infant lives , said in a statement that mrs boxer should stop playing politics with this tragedy investigators are interviewing friends , associates and family members of the suspected gunman , robert l dear jr , to determine whether he had ties to any extremist groups or if anyone helped him plot the attack , according to senior law enforcement officials the authorities also want to know whether mr dear told anyone about the plot in recent weeks , the officials said so far , the authorities have found no evidence that he had help from anyone , the officials said they also said they did not know if the suspect had any political motivations prominent democrats , including mr obama and the house democratic leader , representative nancy pelosi of california , initially reacted to the shootings by reiterating their frequent calls for gun safety legislation , not by suggesting that abortion opponents' attacks on planned parenthood might have been incendiary they were awaiting more information about the shooter and his motivations , democratic aides said others , however , sought to draw a connection between the fiery language used against planned parenthood and the potential for violence on the abc news program this week on sunday , the head of planned parenthood of the rocky mountains , vicki cowart , lamented the hateful speech of recent months among legislators and republican presidential candidates i ca n't believe that this is n't contributing to some folks , mentally unwell or not , thinking that it s ok to target planned parenthood or to target abortion providers , she said for months , house republican leaders have sought to project toughness against planned parenthood through words and the investigations to appease conservative hardliners and , it was hoped , to blunt their fervor for shutting down the government after the first video came out in july , mr boehner said , i think i 'd vomit trying to talk about it from the start , the language used by planned parenthood opponents was provocative , though none of it advocated violence mr boehner , as he announced the creation of the special house committee to investigate abortion providers and fetal tissue businesses , said , recent videos exposing the abortionforbabyparts business have shocked the nation , and demanded action on the presidential campaign trail , where planned parenthood has played a prominent role , senator ted cruz of texas , a republican who is relying on support from christian conservatives , was among the first last summer to demand an investigation into planned parenthood s sale and transfer of aborted body parts of his rivals , carly fiorina has assailed the harvesting of baby parts , including falsely a live fetus s brain , while mike huckabee has said planned parenthood is selling babies' body parts like the parts of a buick republicans' statements on air , in committee hearings , in news releases and on a house website devoted to information on the committees' investigations suggested that republicans had made up their minds against the group the house judiciary committee , for example , entitled its september hearing examining the horrific abortion practices at the nation s largest abortion provider the undercover videos include scenes from a colorado facility , but in denver rather than the colorado springs site david daleiden , the 26yearold abortion opponent who created the center for medical progress and who posed as a biotechnology representative to infiltrate planned parenthood affiliates and surreptitiously record his attempts to procure tissue for research , posted a statement on the center s website condemning the barbaric killing spree in colorado springs by a violent madman mr daleiden , who had shared his video results with a few republican state legislators and members of congress before their public release , did not address early criticisms that his work might have helped incite extremists or the mentally ill since july , several republicans have contended that planned parenthood committed criminal acts profiting from selling body parts , altering abortion procedures to preserve certain organs , even murdering fetuses representative trey gowdy , a conservative from south carolina , on fox news in july said the videos showed planned parenthood to be barbaric , depraved and right on the precipice of discussing homicide the investigating committees are not expected to finish until next year , aides say yet the website created by house republican leaders for a chronology of the committees' work already concludes that the videos show planned parenthood officials admitting unethical and potentially illegal procedures that are despicable and abhorrent selling tissue for profit is illegal officials captured on video say repeatedly that planned parenthood seeks no profit but only minimal reimbursements 30 to 100 , one doctor says for expenses like processing or transporting tissue officials also are recorded describing , sometimes in clinically callous tones , how doctors could alter an abortion procedure to preserve specific tissue or organs , without harming the patient some republicans have suggested that is illegal and some medical ethicists have called it ethically questionable at worst in october , planned parenthood said it would no longer take money for any tissue transfers , but has denied any wrongdoing of its approximately 700 health centers , under half provide abortions including the colorado springs facility that was attacked and just three affiliates in west coast states have arrangements with researchers , universities or procurement companies to transfer tissue from fetuses or fetal placentas many affiliates especially in conservative states do not want to invite controversy , officials say , though patients often ask to make tissue donations a 1993 federal law allows fetal tissue for research supporters included two current republican leaders senator mitch mcconnell of kentucky , now the majority leader , and representative fred upton of michigan , chairman of a committee investigating planned parenthood
washington hillary clinton is wrong about the benghazi committee it s not the longestrunning special congressional investigation ever , as the hillary a , other congressional probes have lasted a lot longer than 17 months , including hearings on the conduct of the civil war \( 40 months \) and the assassinations of jfk and martin luther king jr \( 30 months \) but hillary clinton is also right about the benghazi committee it has nullified itself the republicans created the committee in 2014 , but it soon became clear it was going to stretch into 2016 as a way to torment hillary during campaign season and keep her back on her heels after the republicans had picked a candidate then kevin mccarthy went on sean hannity s fox news show , spilling and crowing about how the republicans had put together the benghazi committee to tar the democratic frontrunner as untrustable and drag down her numbers in that moment , hillary shook off her bad juju and mccarthy got it , losing his shot at being speaker the questions the panel initially planned to look into were legitimate , even though there were cascading inquiries it remains hard to believe that ambassador christopher stevens and other personnel could have been under attack at different facilities in benghazi , libya , over a span of seven and a half hours without any nearby military bases ready and able to provide air cover as senator john mccain once put it on abc , why did n't hillary see the cable that came to her office three weeks before the murderous siege that said the consulate in benghazi could not withstand a coordinated attack , and where were the department of defense assets \? it is still painful to contemplate that the four deaths came after repeated requests from stevens s team for many more security agents for the embassy in tripoli and mission in benghazi had been unceremoniously rebuffed by the state department on friday , cnn s jake tapper pressed clinton about why the state department rejected those increasingly jittery requests that was left to the security professionals , she replied , adding that reports had concluded that the security professionals in the state department had to look worldwide and had to make some tough decisions she said it was n't the job of a secretary of state to be reaching down and making those decisions but , as the main proponent of getting rid of muammar elqaddafi , which led to libya deteriorating into violence and chaos , clinton should have been more vigilant about the safety of the intrepid ambassador whose death , she said , was a great personal loss trey gowdy s benghazi committee was initially set up to investigate issues such as how did the defense department deal with security at american embassies and other overseas facilities \? how does the government respond when its employees abroad are in trouble \? how much did administration officials , thinking about the president s looming reelection , try to spin the explanation of the attack on the benghazi compound \? but as the times s eric lipton , noam scheiber and michael schmidt reported in a frontpage story last week , the committee fell into disarray bradley podliska , an air force reserve officer and republican staffer fired from the committee , told the times that things degenerated to the point where members formed a wine club and staffers started a gun club , discussing buying monogrammed 9millimeter glock handguns in the committee conference room so at least something was accomplished the committee came to life only when it stumbled into the fact that clinton had used a private email server while secretary of state to keep some of her communications off the books gowdy told speaker john boehner that looking into the emails could be a distraction from the benghazi investigation but the committee could n't resist , becoming more and more obsessed with the scintillating email trail hillary s decision to circumvent the state department email system showed bad and paranoid judgment , and left her official emails as secretary vulnerable to hacking and all her tap dancing that other secretaries did it and that none of the emails were marked classified at the time she sent or received them does n't get her off the hook as enjoyable as it is seeing sidney blumenthal on the hot seat , gowdy and company should have left the email matter to another congressional committee and the justice department they just could n't stop themselves , any more than they could stop themselves from cutting democrats out of witness interviews or from trumpeting that clinton s aide huma abedin was going to testify on friday clinton told tapper she did n't know what to expect from the grilling this coming thursday by her republican inquisitors it has been touted as a huge moment that could determine whether she can survive in a campaign already clouded with all the usual clinton rulebreaking and conflicts of interest would she be so wounded that joe biden would have to jump in and rescue the party \? republicans are still savoring the idea of getting hillary to raise her hand to take the oath they do seem to enjoy coming after me , hillary told tapper with a smile but it s going to be less a showdown than a show trial the verdict is already in the republicans are guilty it s not that hillary has gotten so much more trustable it s just that the republicans are so much less credible
at a time when americans could benefit from deeper political news coverage in the united states , the media are sliding toward thinner coverage and evershorter news nuggets of information journalists like me used to bemoan tv s 20second sound bites today , we 're lucky to have even skimpier news morsels in social media to complain about despite the proliferation of socalled news channels on tv , audiences for them are declining and people are turning more frequently to skeletal updates they consume quickly on the small screens of their phones and tablets during many hours of the day , even the news channels are devoting primetime hours to opinion shows and infotainment about travel , food and sports americans are constantly being polled about complex political subjects like the iran nuclear deal , or relations with russia or the financial machinations among our closest allies in europe none of these subjects are simple yet american presidential candidates are responding to them with quips , tweets and photos , and potential voters are learning about them through the news equivalents of those 100calorie bags of chips and cookies it s a terrible diet if the goal is beefing up understanding and even if we concede that most americans care more about food , fashion , fame and football than about anything political or international , the result is candidates who get away with simplistic answers and find themselves in office with shallow public support democracy depends on an informed electorate choosing capable leaders news organizations are trimming operations and devoting more time and space to pop culture because it attracts consumers very few are investing in more , deeper and better journalism , because readers and viewers do n't choose it maybe it s time to abandon the founders' unfulfilled vision of a press completely separate from government , and devote a portion of our tax dollars , as the british do , to underwriting thorough , investigative , nonpartisan watchdog journalism ralph begleiter newark , del a republic that prefers to be amused more than informed and engaged on the issues that touch its national life , its future and its role in the world is not only amusing ourselves to death , as the critic and educator neil postman once put it , but forfeiting its place of leadership among the community of nations our candidates for high office tweet sophomoric insults at one another and yuk it up on latenight talk shows while syria burns , thousands of refugees pour into europe , students are gunned down on our campuses and the economy continues to stagnate ours is a culture in crisis , yet the fourth estate is more committed to its corporate profitability than to its civic responsibility the news media did not create the current crisis , but they have failed for too long to cover it seriously and chosen instead to profit from the culture of shallow amusement we have the media and the political leadership we deserve roy alden atwood west frankfort , ill i agree that there are serious problems with our news coverage , but i think that the primary problem lies not with thoroughness , as the writer suggests , but more with the manner of presentation there are still news organizations such as the new york times and public television that give the reader an extensive diet of news coverage and analysis but even there the news is presented in entertainment mode , with headlinegrabbing emphasis on political wins and losses rather than substance the entertainment focus , no doubt motivated by the need to increase readership and advertising revenues , is illustrated at its worst by the constant focus on the ups and downs of presidential candidates for a period up to two years before the election there is an overemphasis on tv debates , which promote form over substance and reward the glib promoter and huckster but punish the candidate who relies upon careful thought and deliberation in sum , the determined reader able to spend sufficient time can find weighty news in a few journalistic outlets if he or she digs below the headlines , but most readers who must look quickly at bold print and skim or rely exclusively on mainstream or cable tv will be left with the impression that life is mostly a political sports event harold j smith white plains the decline in quality of america s conversations about the world today , and of our politicians' attempts to help voters understand the world they would lead us through , both perfectly parallel the decline of america s broadcast and print news media our refusal to deal with the complexity of the challenges we face is ratified by news media bent on speeding up their meaningless news cycles and shortening our attention spans all this reflects the falsest of choices ever foisted on me by a news consultant when i first became a news anchor in 1973 at wcbstv in new york city you have to decide , said this guy , are you going to educate or entertain \? his smug smile told me that he knew right answer was the latter my reply education is entertaining how i wish more people in today s television news believed this dave marash tijeras , nm mr begleiter is right that far too many americans get their news from sources that do not encourage them to engage with complex issues the internet has had both positive and negative effects with respect to this on the one hand , a quick google search can provide easy access to government reports and academic studies , empowering ordinary citizens to dig deeper and check the facts themselves in ways that were previously not feasible on the other hand , a social networking platform like twitter , with its 140character limit , is ideal not for communicating information and ideas but rather for mindlessly expressing emotions and spreading outrage without giving any thought to opposing viewpoints this mindset has spread to campaign emails , which often consist of incendiary \( and sometimes factually questionable \) oneliners intended to spur anger against the opposing candidate that can be translated into donations it seems unlikely that establishing an official governmentrun news source would solve this problem even if it was successful at providing thorough and balanced coverage , citizens could simply choose not to consume it the solution needs to come from the american people demanding better from the media and politicians i 'll seriously consider voting for any candidate democratic or republican who has the guts to just say no to tweeting and conducts a campaign based on serious proposals to address the issues facing our nation david golub new york mr begleiter is right to note that as news becomes ever more compressed and trivialized , candidates for public office respond to the degraded media environment by further compressing and trivializing their own take on complex issues it s a depressing downward spiral i do n't think there s much chance of directly taxing americans to fund indepth journalism but a dozen or so indispensable national centers of good journalism \( like the times \) would surely benefit from having allied nonprofit foundations a different way to use the tax code constructively to support the fourth estate this fix would still benefit only people who indepth reporting , however the bigger challenge posed by our metastasizing culture of distraction would remain peter laarman los angeles everything mr begleiter says about the state of american journalism is true , yet the only thing worse than what we have now would be his suggestion of using tax dollars to create thorough , investigative , nonpartisan watchdog journalism it ca n't be done news organizations are inherently biased , no matter where their money comes from even if public funding removed the market pressures , journalists would still pick and choose what to cover and how to cover it based on their political and social beliefs if it were actually possible to create news organizations that were always properly balanced and focused , we could just use the same money to recruit and train ideal politicians in the first place i tell you it ca n't be done as the novelist henry james observed , it takes a great deal of history to produce a little literature it also takes a great deal of journalism to produce a little news because there is no infallible news source , one has to sift many imperfect sources it would be very dangerous to set up a news organization with government backing and label it as the premier source like it or not , we 're better off with the food fight we have mark r godburn north canaan , conn mr begleiter is on target in his assertion that democracy depends on an informed electorate choosing capable leaders however , his notion of governmentfunded nonpartisan watchdog journalism is wishful thinking mr begleiter seems to think that the problem is in the nature or quality of the media blaming the media for the simplistic and shallow quality of our political discourse is like blaming the messenger it is up to the citizenry to become well informed about complex issues , and ubiquitous technology makes such information readily available the solution is not in deeper political news coverage , but in a better educated public larry hoffner new york i could n't agree more with mr begleiter s sentiments i feel fortunate to live now in australia , where the publicly funded australian broadcasting corporation provides a feast of intelligent radio and television content , from news , documentaries and discussion to comedy , drama and film in sydney alone i can listen to five commercialfree radio stations offering 24hour news , classical music and more i strongly believe that the public here is far better educated and informed as a result there is far less of the divisive journalism \( such as fox news \) here what passes for news in the united states is really comment and \( uninformed \) opinion kim hoggard sydney , australia readers are certainly correct when they warn that establishing a publicly funded news organization is fraught with challenges and i agree with mr smith , mr hoffner and mr golub that our citizens have a responsibility to work at keeping themselves well informed i'm not so sure that a publicfunded news organization must necessarily be an official government operation as mr laarman notes , there are other ways to support national centers of good journalism , as britain , australia and a few others do my biggest fear is that market forces , cited by several readers , are driving traditional and even socalled new media toward business models that simply wo n't support good journalism or an informed public like many americans , mr atwood assumes that news organizations have some kind of civic responsibility but marketdriven corporations , which today own most of america s news operations , have no such responsibility it s easy for their nonjournalist managements to leave the mission of informing the public to someone else cbs infamously broadcast a football game instead of a presidential impeachment vote in 1998 , tarnishing its decadeslong mantle as one of the nation s most respected sources of public affairs information only a handful of american news organizations still employ professional staffs to travel widely , report independently , and write and edit knowledgeably about public affairs the rest , especially social and solely online media , are mere aggregators of the work of those few if market forces prevail , the aggregators wo n't have any sources to cite , and no one will be supporting much more than scooping up photos , video and contributions of untrained citizen journalists i especially enjoyed the sarcasm of a facebook writer who posted in response to my initial letter tl dr \( social media acronym for too long did n't read \) ralph begleiter newark , del
washington the fight over funding the that began with republicans thundering about a lawless president abusing power to change immigration policy ended with a quiet capitulation tuesday when the house voted to fund the agency and avert a partial shutdown in the end , speaker was forced to build a majority on democratic votes to pass the bill , 257 to 167 , with just 75 republican supporters but although the uprising among conservatives burned hot into the week , there was no suggestion that mr boehner s leadership was imperiled instead , many republicans expressed a sense of resigned relief the bill , which president obama will sign , dealt only with an appropriation for the department republicans agreed to drop their push for provisions that would have gutted mr obama s executive actions on immigration how did we end up with kind of a slow demise , you mean , even after a very hefty kind of rhetoric \? asked representative john fleming , republican of louisiana well , apparently that s the way it s done around here i do n't agree with it representative mick mulvaney , republican of south carolina , called the outcome an unmitigated loss for conservatives but he , like many other members who voted against the bill , also said there had been no serious discussion in the conference about trying to remove mr boehner from his speakership mr boehner s decision , surprising in its timing , reduced the potential for the political fallout that republicans would have faced if the department s operations were halted in a way that harmed public safety the top three house republicans mr boehner of ohio , as well as representative kevin mccarthy of california , the majority leader , and representative steve scalise of louisiana , the whip voted for the bill in a closed meeting of republicans on tuesday morning , mr boehner told members that he was as outraged and frustrated as you at the lawless and unconstitutional actions of this president , according to one person who was in the room , speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss a private session mr boehner added that he thought the decision was the right one for this team , and the right one for this country mr boehner s turnabout came after his leadership team had a humiliating setback on friday , narrowly averting a partial shutdown of the department after his more conservative members revolted against a republican plan to pass a threeweek funding measure the house leadership had hoped that the shortterm measure would provide it with more time to pressure the senate to take up a bill that passed the house in january that legislation would have funded the agency but also would have gutted the legal protections that mr obama provided through executive actions to as many as five million undocumented immigrants , including children but the backlash against the near shutdown of the agency was swift , with republicans shouldering most of the criticism from democrats , from the news media and even from many in their own party the republican leadership which had promised to govern effectively , without the threat of shutdowns , after gaining control of both chambers of congress in the november elections had now failed its first major governing test , and it realized it needed to move beyond the current fight this week , a wall street journal editorial called the recalcitrant republican conference cliff marchers , warning that the impasse was a choice between recognizing political reality , or marching off a cliff to almost certain failure on tuesday morning , mr boehner presented three possible solutions to his members a partial shutdown of the agency , another shortterm measure that would postpone the fight or a clean funding bill with no immigration provisions his members quietly accepted full funding you would have thought we were talking about renaming a post office , said representative peter t king , republican of new york , who has long pushed to fund the department with no strings attached i do give john boehner credit for standing strong through all this and guiding us , mr king said a certain group takes the party in this crazy direction , and we end up coming back and doing the right thing in the end , with just political damage done along the way thank god there was no governmental damage done along the way the timing of the vote was auspicious , and strategic by bringing up the legislation on the day that prime minister benjamin netanyahu of israel addressed a joint meeting of congress , mr boehner capitalized on the spectacle and the political cushion from his members , who were pleased with the way he stood up to the white house in inviting mr netanyahu to speak after mr boehner presented the plan , he asked for questions but received none then , representative doug lamborn , republican of colorado , stood up to thank the speaker for standing strong in the face of white house attacks on mr netanyahu , and the conference gave mr boehner a standing ovation but not every lawmaker seemed pleased with the outcome representative tim huelskamp , republican of kansas , said that the speaker had just caved in and that his strategy had clearly failed toothandnail ended in here today , he said , referring to mr boehner s promise to fight the president s executive actions on immigration tooth and nail everybody kind of must have laughed to themselves when he said he s going to listen and work with all members in the future i do n't think a soul in there believed that story similarly , representative steve king , republican of iowa and an outspoken immigration opponent , said that he was frustrated with tuesday s vote , but that his conference had succumbed to the exhaustion of the relentless push and the strategic moves that were made in the senate , and also in the house i think the mood of this thing is such that to bring it back from the abyss is very , very difficult , mr king said tuesday s reversal by house republicans also reflected a win for congressional democrats , who had opposed any bill that did not fully fund the agency with no additional provisions , forcing republicans into a jam and , ultimately , into passing a clean bill , as democrats had demanded representative charlie dent , republican of pennsylvania and a moderate , also said the funding bill was a win for the governance wing of the party if we are going to spend all of our time and energy moving from cliff to cliff , crisis to crisis , shutdown to shutdown , it s going to prevent us from doing the other necessary work the american people expect us to do , mr dent said if we can get that right , then we can start dealing with other policy issues , whether it be trade , transportation , tax reform , whatever
london as a british officer who had more than his share of fighting in afghanistan , iraq and the balkans , it pains me greatly to see words and actions from the that can only provoke further violence and loss of life the united nations human rights council on last summer s conflict in , prepared by judge mary mcgowan davis , and published on monday , will do just that the report starts by attributing responsibility for the conflict to s protracted occupation of the west bank and the gaza strip , as well as the blockade of gaza israel withdrew from gaza 10 years ago in 2007 it imposed a selective blockade only in response to attacks by and the import of munitions and military mat riel from iran the conflict last summer , which began with a dramatic escalation in rocket attacks targeting israeli civilians , was a continuation of hamas s war of aggression in an unusual concession , the report suggests that hamas may have been guilty of war crimes , but it still legitimizes hamas s rocket and tunnel attacks and even sympathizes with the geographical challenges in launching rockets at israeli civilians gaza s small size and its population density make it particularly difficult for armed groups always to comply with the requirement not to launch attacks from civilian areas there is no such sympathy for israel judge davis accuses the israel defense forces of serious violations of international humanitarian law and international human rights law yet no evidence is put forward to substantiate these accusations it is as though the drafters of the report believe that any civilian death in war must be illegal referring to cases in which israeli attacks killed civilians in residential areas , judge davis says that in the absence of contrary information available to her commission , there are strong indications that the attacks were disproportionate , and therefore war crimes but all we get is speculation and the presumption of guilt the report is characterized by a lack of understanding of warfare that is hardly surprising judge davis admitted , when i before her in february , that the commission , though investigating a war , had no military expertise perhaps that is why no attempt has been made to judge israeli military operations against the practices of other armies without such international benchmarks , the report s findings are meaningless the commission could have listened to gen martin e dempsey , chairman of the united states joint chiefs of staff , who said last november that the idf had taken extraordinary measures to try to limit civilian casualties or to a group of 11 senior military officers from seven nations , including the united states , germany , spain and australia , who also investigated the gaza conflict recently i was a member of that group , and our , made available to judge davis , said none of us is aware of any army that takes such extensive measures as did the idf last summer to protect the lives of the civilian population the report acknowledges that israel took steps to warn of imminent attacks but suggests more should have been done to minimize civilian casualties yet it offers no opinion about what additional measures israel could have taken it even criticizes israel for using harmless explosive devices the knock on the roof as a final warning to evacuate targeted buildings , suggesting that it created confusion no other country uses roofknocks , a munition developed by israel as part of a series of idf warning procedures , including text messages , phone calls and leaflet drops , that are known to have saved many lives judge davis suggests that the idf s use of air , tank and artillery fire in populated areas may constitute a war crime and recommends further international legal restrictions on their use yet these same systems were used extensively by american and british forces in similar circumstances in iraq and afghanistan they are often vital in saving the lives of our own soldiers , and their curtailment would jeopardize military effectiveness while handing an advantage to our enemies the idf is not perfect in the heat of battle and under stress its commanders and soldiers undoubtedly made mistakes weapons malfunctioned , intelligence was sometimes wrong and , as with all armies , it has some bad soldiers unnecessary deaths resulted , and these should be investigated and the individuals brought to trial if criminal culpability is suspected the reason so many civilians died in gaza last summer was not israeli tactics or policy it was hamas s strategy hamas deliberately positioned its fighters and munitions in civilian areas , knowing that israel would have no choice but to attack them and that civilian casualties would result unable to inflict existential harm on israel by military means , hamas sought to cause large numbers of casualties among its own people in order to bring international condemnation and unbearable diplomatic pressure against israel judge davis s report is rife with contradictions she acknowledges that israeli military precautions saved lives , yet without foundation accuses decision makers at the highest levels of the government of israel of a policy of deliberately killing civilians incredibly , she regrets that her commission was unable to verify the use of civilian buildings by palestinian armed groups , yet elsewhere acknowledges hamas s widespread use of protected locations , including united nations schools most worrying , judge davis claims to be fully aware of the need for israel to address its security concerns while demanding that it lift , immediately and unconditionally , the blockade on gaza along with the report s endorsement of hamas s antiisrael narrative , this dangerous recommendation would undoubtedly lead to further bloodshed in both israel and gaza
after 16 years of taking satirical aim at the hypocrisy of politics and the fatuousness of the news media , jon stewart said goodbye to the daily show on thursday evening with a farewell broadcast that mixed wry parting shots with earnest displays of emotion and with a passionate speech urging his audience not to accept falsehoods and misinformation in their lives mr stewart , 52 , who has presided over this comedy central newsparody show since 1999 , concluded his final episode with a spirited sermon against what he euphemistically described as socialcontract fertilizer \( he also used a familiar and much stronger epithet \) blatant mendacity , mr stewart said , has become ubiquitous and pernicious whenever something s been titled freedom family fairness health america , take a good long sniff , he said the only way to combat the relentless intrusions of dishonest people , mr stewart said , was through vigilance their work is easily detected , and looking for it is kind of a pleasant way to pass the time , he said so if you smell something , say something , mr stewart added and then , for good measure , there was a performance by bruce springsteen and the e street band the broadcast began with what appeared to be a traditional opening act in which mr stewart poked fun at a current event in this case , the republican presidential debates in cleveland but this was simply a setup for the many onair correspondents and contributors who have passed through the daily show during mr stewart s time on the show to pay their final tributes among the celebrated alumni who gave their testimonials , steve carell , who went on to become the star of nbc s the office and films like foxcatcher , joked that he had never really left the daily show becoming an international superstar is just something i did while waiting for my next assignment , mr carell said larry wilmore , who now hosts his own comedy central latenight series , the nightly show , groused that his program had been preempted this evening black shows matter , jon , he said to mr stewart there were further cameos from john oliver , kristen schaal and samantha bee , as well as mr stewart s daily show successor , trevor noah , who wandered onto the set with a tape measure \( could you give me like 20 more minutes \? mr stewart asked him \) in a taped montage , several of mr stewart s past targets of ridicule , including chris christie , hillary rodham clinton , bill o 'reilly and john kerry , fired back goodnatured ripostes at him so long , jackass , john mccain declared at the end of the segment and of course there was a visit from , the former daily show correspondent and star of comedy central s colbert report , who is about to succeed david letterman as the host of cbs s late show in a sincere and seemingly unscripted speech , mr colbert told mr stewart that , though mr stewart had previously told his staff members never to thank you because we owe you nothing , this was one of the few times i have known you to be dead wrong you were infuriatingly good at your job , mr colbert told mr stewart all of us who were lucky enough to work with you for 16 years are better at our jobs because we got to watch you do yours mr stewart first disclosed on a daily show broadcast that he intended to leave the program this show does n't deserve an even slightly restless host , and neither do you , he said at the time since then , mr stewart , whose handful of extracurricular activities include writing and directing the 2014 drama rosewater , has kept relatively quiet about his future plans , except to say that he intends to spend more time with his family \( on that billed itself as the exclusive , definitive jon stewart exit interview , the host spoke mostly about the catered meals he and his staff ate on the program \) in his final weeks in the anchor chair , mr stewart largely resisted any impulses toward selfcongratulation or gauzy nostalgia most nights found him inveighing against favorite nemeses , like the koch brothers or his critics at the fox news channel he played a few retrospective montages that emphasized his shortcomings , spotlighting , and on news events none of this discouraged some of mr stewart s final guests from pleading with him to stick around a little longer when president obama appeared on the daily show , he jokingly told mr stewart i'm issuing a new executive order that jon stewart cannot leave the show it s being challenged in the courts while interviewing his friend and fellow comedian denis leary , mr stewart said he was comfortable with his decision to step down when you do something that you know you will never be as good at something as you were at this , you have to make peace with it , mr stewart said and i 've made peace with it in his final remarks to his audience , mr stewart thanked his wife and children for teaching me what joy looks like , and told his viewers that he was not leaving their lives for good nothing ends , mr stewart said it s just a continuation it s a pause in the conversation so rather than saying goodbye or good night , i'm just going to say i'm going to go get a drink and i'm sure i 'll see you guys before i leave
tikrit , iraq iraqi officials insisted for weeks that islamic state fighters had been all but exterminated in tikrit , confined to a few pockets in the city center yet on sunday , military officials in the city were reluctant to allow journalists to head back to baghdad by road even though the highway skirts tikrit well to the west the supposed safer alternative was a general s iraqi air force cessna waiting at the tikrit air base nine miles northwest of downtown but before takeoff , two mortar shells slammed into a grassy patch between the airfield s two runways , within 100 yards of the small plane iraqi military escorts surmised that the person shooting had to have been within visual range and probably to the west , although downtown was southeast daesh are everywhere , one senior officer said , using the arab nickname for the islamic state , also known as or isil during a twoday visit to tikrit , a strategic city in s central sunni heartland , it was clear that after four weeks of the government offensive the islamic state s fighters are more numerous and still hold much more territory here than officials had previously allowed , even with heavy american airstrikes added in according to iraqi military officials and fighters on the ground in tikrit , still dominates or controls about 20 square miles of the city , everything from the edge of tikrit university in the north , to the far end of the new ouja neighborhood in the south , a distance as much as eight miles north to south that encompasses most of the populous parts of the city , which generally lie west of the tigris river all of its main downtown and business districts the government quarter and the former palace of saddam hussein government forces remain mostly east of the tigris , an area that is predominantly rural and agricultural , or on the suburban or rural outskirts of the city on the western and southern sides the city s population used to be more than a quarter million , but most residents have fled the army headquarters for the operation are situated at a campus building not far from the front line with isis though here , front line is a relative term eight mortar tubes were set up around the headquarters to provide defense , and they were pointing not just south toward the center of tikrit , but also to the north and northeast those mortars were all fired relatively frequently saturday and sunday , their shots alternating with the groundshaking blasts of bombs being dropped from time to time by coalition aircraft lt gen abdul alwahab alsaadi , the commander of the tikrit offensive , said that while the iraqi military s positions around the city had not changed significantly , special operations forces and elite police units were carrying out reconnaissance in force into the city and had penetrated to within 600 yards of the government complex in the city center he said the going had been slow because at first iraqi forces wanted to leave space for civilians to flee the city , and then wanted to proceed in a way that kept casualties among the military and its allied shiite militias as low as possible despite weeks of fighting , he insisted that the progovernment forces had sustained few fatalities , and estimated that isis had 450 to 750 fighters left in the city , and had lost an equal number killed shiite militias were losing about an average of eight fighters a day killed , according to cemetery workers in najaf , where most shiite martyrs are buried while that was a nationwide estimate , most of them would have been fighting in salahuddin province but wafiq alhashemi , director of the iraqi group for strategic studies , an independent research organization that often provides advice to the iraqi government , said his estimates of isis fighters still active in tikrit were in the range of 2 , 000 to 3 , 000 he also said that not only did isis still dominate the 20squaremile area between tikrit university and ouja , but that the iraqi military still had not succeeded in taking control of highway 1 north of tikrit , between tikrit and mosul , where isis has its major base in  the militants in tikrit have been able to keep using that supply line to the north even though they are surrounded within the city , using tunnels to evade government lines and keep access to the road the government cannot do it unless the international alliance keeps up these airstrikes , he said according to gen lloyd austin , who as head of the united states central command is in overall charge of the coalition in iraq and syria , the iraqi military has about 4 , 000 troops under its command in tikrit far less than the 30 , 000 figure iraqi officials had cited , although that included militia forces as well he insisted that the shiite militias were not involved in the tikrit battle any longer , after the american military told congressional leaders last week that it had agreed to support iraqi operations in tikrit with airstrikes only after being assured that shiite militias , many of them with iranian advisers , had been  there was considerable confusion in tikrit , however , over the new terms of engagement while some of the militiamen said they would pull out of the fight , many others could be seen on the front lines of it in addition , , officially known as the popular mobilization forces , were seen arriving in significant numbers in tikrit on saturday and sunday however , iranian advisers who had been working with some of the militias , in particular , have no longer been reported on the battlefields around tikrit and elsewhere in salahuddin province the popular mobilization did not withdraw , they are still here , general saadi , who is in overall charge of the tikrit offensive , said in an interview over the weekend some of them were sent to do different duties inside our area of operation none of them , however , were removed from the battle when the coalition began bombing , the general insisted the people who are here with us are still here , they did n't leave , some were just moved to another place general saadi said that while no military wants to be dependent on militias and irregular forces , iraq had no choice if we were a complete army i would say no , but we need the popular mobilization forces the battle requires them to be with us on sunday , about 60 shiite fighters arrived at general saadi s headquarters from the shiite heartland around karbala as part of a militia called qataba imam ali , wearing black uniforms with body armor and carrying a mixture of light and heavy weapons their commander was lt col salim mizher , who said his men were eager to join the fight but when an iraqi officer , brig gen abbas khudair , explained that the militiamen were being incorporated into the army and would not operate independently , answering to iraqi generals , colonel mizher objected we answer to sheikh maithan and no other person , he said ,

washington yemen s volatile civil war has been depicted as merely a battleground between sunni arab countries and shiite iran for dominance in the middle east the houthis , northern tribal rebels who have waged a prolonged insurgency against the yemeni government , took the capital , sana , in september and have continued to seize territory since , drawing near to the southern port city of aden , forcing president abdu rabbu mansour hadi to flee and prompting a saudiled military intervention last month but in fact , the conflict in yemen is local , not regional and the saudiled , americanbacked bombing campaign is doomed to failure it will fuel yemen s internal strife , condemning it to a protracted torment that could rival syria s fouryearold civil war washington and riyadh have pushed the narrative of an iraniansupported houthi rebellion in yemen this is an oversimplification at best while the houthis are shiites , their zaydi faith is theologically distinct from the shiite practices of most iranians historically , this has limited ties between them and tehran and although iran has given the houthis some financial support , it has not been directly involved in the conflict in fact , many of the houthis' recent gains are a result of their alliance with sunni supporters of mr hadi s predecessor , ali abdullah saleh , who was removed from power in 2012 , during the arab spring iran s major gains in the region are in postsaddam hussein iraq , where the iranians are funding and training shiite militias battling the islamic state in syria , iranian support has been critical to the survival of the regime of bashar alassad yemen , where iran s involvement is trivial , is simply not a major front in this broader regional struggle the conflict in yemen a continuing power struggle between the central government and the many secessionist and tribal groups that seek greater autonomy is all about yemen and it dates back more than half a century yemen itself was not even unified until 1990 , when the collapse of the soviet union led marxist south yemen to unite with the yemen arab republic to the north in addition to conflicts between the two states , yemen has experienced a succession of civil wars both before and after reunification , including rebellions by both northern tribesmen and southern secessionists these conflicts were driven largely by uneven economic development and a distrust of the central government in today s crisis we find not only the culmination of a 10year guerrilla war by the northern houthi tribesmen , but also a growing insurgency in the east by al qaeda in the arabian peninsula , continued popular dissatisfaction in the south , and mixed support for the transitional government by mainstream political parties the united states plays a role , too , as drone strikes targeting al qaeda in the arabian peninsula have sparked popular outrage against the government this is why the bombing campaign is so shortsighted ostensibly , the coalition has several broad objectives saudi officials emphasize their intention to roll back houthi gains , and to restore mr hadi s government a white house statement pledging american intelligence and logistical support emphasized the same factors though it has not been explicitly stated , the persian gulf states that are backing the saudi intervention the united arab emirates , kuwait , qatar and bahrain also have another goal combating growing iranian influence yet bombing has so far failed to achieve any of these objectives past foreign military interventions in yemen have failed following a fouryear insurgency against colonial rule , the british were forced to withdraw from aden in 1967 , resulting in the formation of the people s republic of south yemen an intervention led by gamal abdel nasser of egypt in 196267 , designed to prop up a proegyptian government , likewise failed as yemeni tribesmen waged an effective guerrilla war against egyptian troops more recently , a 2009 saudi invasion of northern yemen , responding to crossborder raids by the houthis , ended in the withdrawal of saudi troops , and no strategic gains each failed because of the internecine nature of tribal conflict in yemen and the effective use of guerrilla tactics any ground force in the current conflict will also suffer defeat the houthis have long felt marginalized by yemen s political processes , and argue that corruption and a lack of representation mean that they do n't experience any benefits from economic development or yemen s natural resources the group has waged a successful decadelong guerrilla war against the government in sana they know the terrain and have local support after more than a decade of counterinsurgency strategy in afghanistan , the futility of subduing tribal insurgencies should be well known to the united states moreover , restoring mr hadi , now in exile in riyadh , would solve none of yemen s underlying problems the free and fair elections promised during the arab spring were postponed because of factional disagreements mr hadi himself has no domestic power base though this made him an ideal compromise candidate in 2012 , it constrains his ability to effectively govern the united states should encourage a political settlement , focused not on reinstalling a figurehead , but on creating a durable political process that addresses the grievances of yemen s regional groups a twosector federalized state , which the houthis have supported in the past , could provide such a framework yemen has the potential to become the next syria , spiraling into sectarian violence , with money and arms from abroad fueling the conflict if arab airstrikes continue , yemen is likely to become a failed state tragically , al qaeda in the arabian peninsula would be the one beneficiary , as the terrorist group enjoys a respite from drone strikes , counterterrorism campaigns and houthi attacks a bombing campaign wo n't stabilize yemen , or counter iranian influence in the region instead , it could lead to a prolonged and bloody civil war and provide fertile ground for extremist groups with the united states already bogged down in iraq and syria , there is little political appetite among americans for wider intervention in yemen but the united states should stop reflexively supporting the saudiled military campaign , and instead push for a political settlement , so that the arab world is spared from another unmanageable conflict
we don t know exactly when the last sale of enslaved persons occurred in richmond , va , known as the great slave market of the south , but it must have taken place before april 3 , 1865 on the previous day , the order had come to evacuate in advance of the arrival of union troops who liberated the city amid the chaos , a slave trader named robert lumpkin still had a jail full of people he was hoping to sell according to the journalist charles carleton coffin , who was there to witness the fall of richmond , after learning of the order to evacuate , lumpkin quickly handcuffed his human chattels , about 50 men , women and children , and marched them four blocks south to the danvillerichmond railroad depot on the banks of the james river he was hoping to whisk them away , and find buyers for them in another city when they arrived , however , there was no room for them on the train which whirled the confederate government from the capital soldiers with fixed bayonets forced them back it was the last slave gang seen in this western world lumpkin was angry , but there was nothing he could do so , with oaths and curses loud and deep , coffin reported , lumpkin was forced to unlock their handcuffs and allow them to go free these 50 people were worth about 50 , 000 , according to coffin , but on that sunday morning were of less value than the mule and the wagon which had drawn the slavetrader s trunk to the station even though lumpkin s coffle was not , as coffin so colorfully pronounced it , the last slave gang seen in this western world , his comment points to the way that the slave trade had become the iconic symbol of the institution of slavery and with lee s surrender at appomattox only a few days later , the reporter s prophetic statement became true for the united states it was the end of the slave traders and slave gangs richmond had long been the epicenter of the northern end of the american slave trade in the preceding decades , tens of thousands of people had been brought to the city from the surrounding regions , where they were held in jails , sold at auction and sent to labor in the sugar and cotton fields of the deep south from the end of america s participation in the atlantic slave trade in 1808 until the opening of the civil war , at least twothirds of a million people were forcibly relocated through the internal american slave trade from the upper south \( virginia , maryland and north carolina \) to the lower \( especially louisiana , mississippi and alabama \) this massive movement of people populated what was then considered the american southwest and resulted in the destruction of hundreds of thousands of families as husbands and wives , parents and children were sold away the economic engine of the slave trade helped to fuel america s prosperity the profits from the trade in enslaved people flowed to many places traders were not the only ones to profit from america s internal slave trade slave owners in the upper south profited because they received cash for the people they sold slave owners in the lower south profited because the people they purchased were forced to labor in the immensely productive cotton and sugar fields the merchants who supplied clothing and food to the slave traders profited , as did steamboat , railroad and shipowners who carried enslaved people capitalists in the north profited by investing in banks that handled the exchange of money for people , or in insurance companies that provided insurance for the owners investments in enslaved people so did foreign investors in southern securities , some of which were issued on mortgaged slaves the hotbed of american abolitionism new england was also the home of america s cotton textile industry , which grew rich on the backs of the enslaved people forced to pick cotton the story of america s domestic slave trade is not just a story about richmond or new orleans , but about america the slave trade is not merely a footnote or a side story in the history of american slavery , but was central to its modernization and continuation that was well understood by the boston artist david claypool johnston , who used it to powerful illustrative effect in his satirical work the house that jeff built playing off the english nursery rhyme this is the house that jack built , johnston wrote and illustrated a series of 12 verses , beginning with the simple statement , this is the house that jeff built jeff is , of course , jefferson davis , and his house is shown as a slave pen with a sign announcing a slave auction to the left of the door three scenes later , the image shows the inside of a slave auction room , with two men seated on a bench and two women and children standing these are the chattels , the poem tells us , to be sold by the head , in the slave pen a part of the house that jeff built other images show slave dealers , slave buyers , slave breeders , manacles and whips the final image displays the paraphernalia of the slave trade manacles , an auction hammer , a slave auction sign , advertisements and bills of sale for this artist , like so many americans , the slave trade stood at the center of the confederacy and was the reason they had continued to fight the war the last stanza reads but jeff s infamous house is doom d to come down so says uncle sam and so said john brown with slave pen , and auction , shackles , driver , and cat , together with seller , and buyer , and breeder for that most loathsome of bipeds by some call d a man , whose trade is to sell all the chattels he can , from yearlings to adults of life s longest span , in and out of the house that jeff built on that day in richmond in 1865 , when jeff s house finally came down , thousands of people no longer had to fear that at any moment they could be sold away as the city was abandoned , chaos reigned fires set to warehouses grew out of control and burned much of the city on april 4 , abraham lincoln arrived and was thronged by africanamericans , who had lived their entire lives with an auction hammer hanging over their head as a former slave named william wells brown explained none can estimate the suffering their victims undergo if there is one feature of american slavery more abominable than another , it is that which sanctions the buying and selling of human beings after decades of steady business along wall street in richmond , the auction rooms were silent the detritus of the business of human trafficking littered the floor shackles , bills of sale , advertisements , receipts and ledgers on april 8 , 1865 , as the city still smoldered , two massachusetts abolitionists , sarah and lucy chase , who were in virginia to help educate emancipated africanamericans , entered richard h dickinson s slavetrading house on the corner of franklin and wall streets wanting something to document the atrocities of slavery , they scooped up two ledger books and a stack of correspondence documenting the sale of thousands of men , women and children when they first saw richmond from its docks a few days earlier , they had been struck by the symbolic image of the burned out city sarah wrote that nothing was left of the warehouses but the brick walls ragged and jagged pointing their threatening fingers to heaven , concluding , as if saying there is justice she noted that inside the ledger books dickinson had recorded the sales of several slaves on march 31 , but for april 1 one day before the confederate retreat only the date was written there were no sales thank god no more was written or will ever be in that bloody register as union troops filled the streets , as lincoln toured the city , as the auction rooms fell silent , thousands rejoiced that they would never have to fear the slave market again at the end of the war , abolitionists like the chase sisters collected documents and artifacts to preserve the memory of the slave trade and document why the sacrifices of the war had been necessary but with the resurgence of white supremacy in the late 19th century , much of that history was deliberately removed from public memory in richmond , for example , slavetrader offices were quickly repurposed or destroyed first the railroad and then i95 forever altered the landscape where most of the trade took place but the story of the slave trade lived on in the family histories of africanamericans , and in the last decade of so , its memory has returned to the broader public consciousness as well current exhibitions on the slave trade in richmond and new orleans have led to new discoveries of histories long buried this new research into the slave trade will give all of us an opportunity to make sure that it is never forgotten again

glendale , ariz to try to win the super bowl , new england quarterback and the first fearlessly , then desperately tested the strength of the ' strength the secondary of the league s no 1 defense the way few have they threw 50 passes , mostly quick and dinky ones meant to be caught before seattle s defensive backs could react they threw away from the allpro cornerback richard sherman and toward the lesserknown members of the defensive backfield , forced onto the field by injuries and new england s surgical strategy the results were scattered , but in the end , it was the seattle secondary that was tested , and beaten , allowing the patriots to erase a 10point fourthquarter deficit on the way to a 2824 victory entering the fourth quarter , the patriots trailed by 2414 and needed yardage and momentum and new england got them , picking through seattle s tired and depleted defensive backs brady threw two short touchdown passes in the final eight minutes of the game , including the gamewinner against the seattle reserve cornerback tharold simon seattle s secondary arrived with health questions safety earl thomas \( shoulder \) and sherman , the left cornerback \( elbow \) , were hurt in the nfc championship game safety kam chancellor hurt his knee in practice last week all three starters were on the injury list before the game sherman might have been further distracted by the impending birth of his son , as his girlfriend was in arizona , due at any time but the patriots largely ignored him , preferring to attack the right side of the seattle defense and cornerback byron maxwell they threw to sherman s side mostly in situations in which a receiver had led him away from the action , as when linebacker k j wright was beaten by tight end rob gronkowski for a 22yard secondquarter touchdown brady lobbed the ball to the goal line , wright was a step behind the play , and sherman and his fellow legion of boomers were nowhere in the neighborhood to help it was lesserknown members of the secondary who had the biggest impact on the game , good and bad , for the seahawks cornerback jeremy lane intercepted brady at the goal line near the end of the first quarter , the game s first momentumshifting play the patriots had gobbled nearly eight minutes of the quarter with a measured drive that started at their 32yard line but on thirdand6 at the seattle 10 , brady hesitated , leaned away from the coming hit of defensive end michael bennett , and threw over the middle toward the goal line none of his teammates were there lane leapt to intercept the pass , then ran away until he was tackled on the sideline by patriots receiver julian edelman the excitement of the seahawks and the fans was muted moments later at the sight of lane leaving the field on a cart , apparently with a broken arm that further tested the depth of seattle s secondary simon entered the game and was beaten twice on new england s next drive the first was a thirdand9 play at seattle s 35 on which edelman sprinted away from simon on a crossing route , caught a pass and sprinted up the field for a 23yard gain two plays later , receiver brandon lafell ran a quick slant route against simon , and brady found him for an 11yard touchdown pass brady was 20 of 27 for 177 yards and two touchdowns in the first half , and it was obvious that the primary matchup in the second half would be brady against the seattle secondary it proved a daunting matchup in their previous 10 games , the seahawks had allowed only two passing touchdowns in the second half the patriots did it midway through the fourth quarter , when brady s 4yard pass to danny amendola tightened the score to 2421 and they did it again when edelman caught a 3yard pass against simon but the patriots had found themselves in a fit of desperation because of what happened early in the third quarter brady , trailing for the first time and looking for gronkowski again , was intercepted on new england s first secondhalf drive by linebacker bobby wagner six plays and 50 yards later , the seahawks had another touchdown and a 2414 lead seattle needed a big play from its secondary but never got it in the end , it was a littleknown new england defensive back the reserve malcolm butler who made the play of the game , intercepting seattle quarterback russell wilson at the goal line in the final seconds to secure victory the seattle secondary could only stand on the sideline and watch the hopes of the legion of boom had fizzled
long before he ordered a county clerk to jail on thursday for refusing to issue licenses , david l bunning first drew attention as a federal judge for a ruling on gay rights in 2003 , he ordered the school system of rural boyd county , ky , to allow a student group , the gaystraight alliance , to meet on school grounds he later oversaw a legal settlement that included antiharassment sessions for the system s students judge bunning , 49 , arrived on the bench with what looked like a conservative pedigree a former federal prosecutor , he was appointed to the court by president george w bush he is a son of former senator jim bunning of kentucky , a conservative republican who is a former major league pitcher who was inducted into the hall of fame in 1996 judge bunning has shown a willingness to make decisions that put him at odds with conservatives and he is no stranger to fierce controversies none fiercer than the case of kim davis , the rowan county clerk who says her religious beliefs prohibit her from sanctioning samesex marriage when ms davis stopped issuing marriage licenses after the supreme court ruling in june that legalized samesex marriage , judge bunning ordered her to resume , and she refused on thursday , judge bunning found ms davis in contempt for defying the federal court and ordered her held in jail her good faith belief is simply not a viable defense , the judge , wearing a bow tie , said from the bench he noted that , i myself have genuinely held religious beliefs , but added that he took an oath of office to uphold the law mrs davis took an oath , he said oaths mean things in his personal views , i think it s fair to say the judge is conservative , said steve pendery , the judge executive , or chief executive , of campbell county , ky , who is a friend of the judge for him , i'm sure this is not a political thing , just a matter of the law in fact , the judge s mother , mary bunning , , he does n't agree with the supreme court but has to obey the law by all accounts , the judge does not have the outgoing , combative nature of his father , whose 2004 reelection campaign leaned heavily on his vehement opposition to samesex marriage jim bunning was seen in the senate as willing to irritate members of both parties he once publicly called his fellow kentucky republican , senator mitch mcconnell , a control freak but lawyers who have practiced before judge bunning and occasionally see him at lawyers' social functions call him very measured and a man who keeps his opinions to himself over all , i 'd say he s an excellent judge , said todd mcmurtry , the president of the northern kentucky bar association he has a reputation for working hard and keeping his docket moving , and you do n't see his personal views mr pendery , who has known judge bunning most of his life , said he was always a very responsible , serious sort of student and person he s outgoing when he needs to be , but there s a reserve about him judge bunning grew up as the youngest of nine children in the northern kentucky suburbs of cincinnati , graduating from newport central catholic high school , the university of kentucky and the university s law school for the first decade of his legal career , he worked in the united states attorney s office for the eastern district of kentucky after the initial resolution of the boyd county case , judge bunning decided against the school system again in 2006 , ruling that it could not let students who opposed gay rights opt out of antiharassment sessions he was overruled by an appellate court in 2007 , sitting temporarily on the sixth circuit court of appeals , he was part of a threejudge panel that unanimously banning the procedure that abortion opponents call partialbirth abortion in 2011 , he sided with the coal industry and against environmentalists , upholding a federal permit process that made it easier to get permission for mountaintop removal mining the sixth circuit later overturned that ruling

stratforduponavon , england the royal shakespeare company is reaching beyond its namesake at the moment at the troupe s home theater here , and thank heavens for it as the crazed yet cheerful jew of malta who gives christopher marlowe s 1589 play its title , jasper britton makes the merchant barabas a longhaired figure of fury laced with the blackest of comedy the sort of person who can make a simple exclamation like hallelujah sound buoyant and ominous , in turn that s very much as it should be for a play that ts eliot found to be as farcical as it is tragic , and those dual components are jointly served in a fleet staging by the director justin audibert the jew of malta will be running for several more weeks in repertory on the adjacent main stage with its more famous successor , shakespeare s own merchant of venice \( the marlowe production finishes in the swan auditorium on sept 8 \) but while there is little of mirth to be found in the scalding view of the moneylender shylock on view in shakespeare s play , barabas is a different creature altogether a hero pushed to vengeful extremes by a society that has scant time for him or his race , mr britton cuts a cunning , largeeyed malcontent who thinks nothing of sending a convent full of nuns to their deaths marlowe riffing on the aural affinity between none and nun is the play an example of antisemitism or a condemnation of it \? the villainous ithamore \( lanre malaolu \) is , after all , heard to remark that to undo a jew is charity and not sin that longtime debate firmly lands on this occasion in the latter camp , as mr audibert and his colleagues make plain the societal layers of hypocrisy that barabas manages to pierce with a single wellturned inflection or phrase in which context , hallelujah and a burst of gallows humor indeed back in london , one might expect comparable interludes of larkiness to be in evidence in richard ii at shakespeare s globe , a venue that has a history of uncorking the unexpected comedy in many a canonical text in fact , simon godwin s elegantly appointed staging is a comparatively sobersided affair , notwithstanding the occasional jollity gleaned at the expense of the groundlings who as per the globe norm fill the central courtyard \( at the performance attended , an onstage gardener mockthreatened to trim the locks of a rather thickly coiffed woman standing down front \) charles edwards in the title role of the divinely anointed king who has to learn what it is to be a man gets in on the act as well , turning toward a female spectator when richard speaks midway through of need ing friends elsewhere , he voices the word down as if so exalted a monarch has never before bothered to consider the world that lies beneath him one is reminded anew of the neutered emotional state of one of the most luxuriantly spoken characters in all of shakespeare scarcely has richard clocked the death of the eloquently doomladen john of gaunt that small but crucial part is beautifully played by the veteran william gaunt , who presumably is no relation before remarking breezily , so much for that and the actor s easeful saunter suggests someone who has made a casual journey through life until his reckoning with mortality releases a humanity that arrives too late mr godwin has added a prologue not found in the text , in which we see richard ascending to the throne as a child amid a panoply of ceremony and confetti , the young actor briefly inhabiting the title role then supplanted on stage by mr edwards as the play proper begins i confess to not being especially moved this goround as i was , for instance , when eddie redmayne so memorably took the title role \( at the donmar in 2011 \) , and david sturzaker here makes a fairly dull bolingbroke richard s nemesis who goes on to become henry iv but the globe stage looks very handsome dressed in gilded splendor by the designer paul wills , and sarah woodward brings an antic energy to the proceedings lateon involving the fiercely maternal duchess of york best of all , as ever with this text , is a superabundance of language that allows the audience to all but bathe in its rhetorical majesty there are few more piercing descriptions of death than this play s report of the demise of john of gaunt that his tongue is now a stringless instrument no matter how steeped one is in shakespeare , the virtuosity to be heard in richard ii leaves one lost for words for a change of pace and while any decent latesummer weather still allows i highly recommend a visit to the alfresco surrounds of the open air theater in regent s park and the director rachel kavanaugh s buoyant production of seven brides for seven brothers sure , the 1982 broadway debut of this stage version of stanley donen s popular 1954 film did a fast new york fade , and some may feel after scaling the classical heights of marlowe and shakespeare that so potentially dopey a musical takes slumming it a little bit too far but this outdoor venue has done notably well in past years with acclaimed revivals of \( among others \) hello , dolly ! and into the woods , and ms kavanaugh s achievement here is perhaps even more remarkable given source material that in lesser hands might seem too silly by half many will surely recall the story set in 1850 s oregon of the swift courtship between the pretty , domesticminded milly \( the enchanting laura pittpulford \) and the apparently charming yet brutish adam \( alex gaumond \) , who no sooner has wooed and wed milly before landing her with the task of caring for him and his six oafish brothers these mountain men here are wigged to resemble refugees from the park s nearby zoo \( on the behavioral front , these guys not only fail to wait to say grace at the dinner table , they do n't even know what it is \) and while you might wonder what longterm chance milly has with a husband whose idea of a pickup line is nice night for a raccoon hunt , ms kavanaugh turns this featherweight confection into a neat variant on the taming of the shrew milly may look as if she is losing out in the deal when in fact her civilizing impulses are seen to rule the day , the lovesick bull calves that are the pontipee boys learning a thing or two about manners on their way to a wonderful day the tune that brings the show to a close \( the score by gene de paul and johnny mercer was expanded upon for the theater with new songs by al kasha and joel hirschhorn \) alistair david s surpassingly lively choreography couples elaborately danced faceoffs with the occasional bit of axewielding , and a passing reference to plutarch should be enough to satisfy any classicists in the house the evening in keeping with the weather at the moment passes like a

last week federal authorities disclosed that four cancer charities had bilked tens of millions of dollars from donors questions continue to surface about the lack of transparency at the clinton foundation philanthropy , we 're learning , is a world with too much secrecy and too little oversight despite its increasing role in american society , from education to the arts to the media , perhaps no sector is less accountable to outsiders the charitable sector is a bit like the wild west by design foundations have long been granted expansive freedom , on the view that the diversity of america s civil society is one of the country s signature strengths , as alexis de tocqueville famously said , and that government should n't mess with this magic both political parties have been content to impose a minimum of rules on philanthropy for example , foundations do n't have to prove that they 're making good use of billions of dollars of taxsubsidized funds , and nonprofits do n't have to identify their donors , as we 've learned from the clinton foundation saga the law even permits donors to get an immediate tax break for charitable gifts that may sit in investment accounts for decades , never helping anyone and in many states , the rules that do govern philanthropy are barely enforced , which is why the fraud perpetrated by those four cancer charities was undetected for years this lax oversight is out of step with the times and is an invitation to corruption it also makes it hard to answer the simplest questions about charitable giving , such as what society is getting for the 40 billion in tax breaks that donors receive annually were the millions that have gone to the clinton foundation , instead of the internal revenue service , well spent \? we have no way of knowing a look at the clinton foundation s fundraising has also opened a window on another big problem with modern philanthropy how inextricably entwined it has become with politics and ideology while the clinton foundation is at least focused on aiding the world s poor , socalled charitable contributions go to think tanks and advocacy shops that engage in de facto partisan warfare donors can get the same tax break for bankrolling a libertarian push to abolish food stamps as they do for giving to a food pantry philanthropy still does enormous good , perhaps now more than ever but it s alarming how in an era of high inequality , private funders have a growing say over central areas of civic life like education and public parks , and how this influence is often wielded against a backdrop of secrecy earlier this year , for example , a school reform group in philadelphia offered 35 million to help that city close a funding gap , but demanded the right to open more charters as a condition and would n't disclose its donors this secrecy ca n't go on , and it wo n't there has been a push in recent years to hold nearly every sector of american life to tougher standards of accountability , from professional sports to finance to medicine to higher education the same scrutiny needs to be applied to philanthropy philanthropy reform should aim to achieve four broad goals the first is bringing more transparency to charitable donations while it may be ok to allow anonymous gifts to some kinds of nonprofits say , a hospital or the opera groups that work to sway public policy , or are led by former public officials , should disclose where their money is coming from second , and related , we should end the charade that all philanthropy is somehow charitable donors should get varying levels of tax exemption , or none at all , depending on the actual public benefit provided by a nonprofit , measured independently third , foundations and other philanthropic funds should have to give away taxexempt dollars at a faster rate right now , foundations must give away only 5 percent of their endowment every year , and donoradvised funds have no payout requirements at all husbanding endowments in this way does n't make sense when trillions of dollars in new funds are set to flow into philanthropy in coming decades a higher payout rate , say 10 percent , would put such money to work faster and ensure that the immediate hit to the treasury would be offset by more nearterm benefits for society fourth , and most challenging , there needs to be a better accounting of whether philanthropic dollars are effectively spent quite apart from the question of the enormous public subsidy , which will amount to over half a trillion dollars in the next decade , it s problematic that there s no way to assess the performance or impact of such a large , rich and influential part of american society ideally , the philanthropic sector would take the lead in finding ways to assess itself but with the threat of regulation clearly in the background a final point none of these reforms will make much difference without strong watchdogs to oversee philanthropy and nonprofits it s time to create a new federal bureau to police this sector , much as britain has a national charity commission state law enforcement officials must also do a better job of enforcing statelevel laws tocqueville was right when he said that a vibrant civil society is a unique strength of american society but that does n't mean spending public money without asking where it s going all the powerful institutions in american life need vigilant oversight , and philanthropy is no exception
l neburg , germany in what is likely to be among the last chances to bring justice for the holocaust , a german court convicted a 94yearold former ss soldier of colluding in mass murder , and delivered an unstinting depiction both of the horrors of auschwitz and the depths of german guilt the former soldier , oskar gr ning , was sentenced on wednesday to four years in jail for complicity in the murder of 300 , 000 hungarian jews who were brought to the nazis' grimmest death camp in the summer of 1944 in a sweeping 75minute speech , judge franz kompisch presented what amounted to a reckoning with decades of german justice and the failure to prosecute thousands of perpetrators the judge made it plain that every german had a choice about how far to go along with the nazis this is a point that must be made clearly , the judge said to join the ss and take a safe desk job at auschwitz was your decision he added , it was perhaps affected by the era , but it was not because you were unfree mr gr ning , a trained bank teller who , was employed there from september 1942 to october 1944 , assigned to seize cash and valuables from arriving prisoners while he was not accused of gassing prisoners , mr gr ning s trial suggested that he had witnessed enough violence and cruelty to have a clear understanding of the systematic mass murder carried out at the camp in nazioccupied poland you had freedom to think , judge kompisch said to mr gr ning yet you asked to join the ss the main lawyer for the dozens of plaintiffs , thomas walther , called mr kompisch s judgment historic , saying that it was wonderful for his clients and could serve as a corrective to decades of lax prosecution of nazis in german courts on wednesday , the state prosecutor s office in frankfurt announced that another former ss soldier who worked at auschwitz , this one 92 , is facing charges of being an accessory to murder but with having ended 70 years ago , the number of people who could be tried for nazi crimes is dwindling in a biting passage , the judge noted that the state prosecutor s office of l neburg , a midsize jurisdiction , handled some 30 , 000 cases a year by comparison , he noted , experts say 6 , 500 people worked for the ss at auschwitz , yet only 49 of those have been convicted as the judge took the court on a journey to what he described as a seemingly distant past , the only sound in the makeshift courtroom a meeting hall converted to accommodate interest in the trial was the low background buzz of interpreters working in english , hungarian and hebrew the sentence exceeded the three and a half years that state prosecutors had requested mr gr ning s lawyers had sought an acquittal both state prosecutors and hans holtermann , a lawyer for mr gr ning , said they would consider whether to appeal in the next week if so , it could be months before any sentence is final mr gr ning would not be jailed during that time the judgment came a day after mr gr ning , increasingly frail though mentally alert , offered the court what he clearly intended as a direct apology for his crimes i am truly sorry , he said he refrained , however , from asking forgiveness from his victims mr gr ning s remarks as the trial opened on april 21 offered a remarkably clear if often harrowing account of his time in auschwitz he admitted his moral complicity , but stopped short of an apology on july 1 , he addressed the court once more , saying that the evil of the holocaust was too great to entitle him to a pardon from anyone other than god none of the dozens of plaintiffs , who joined state prosecutors in accusing mr gr ning , were in court on wednesday their lawyers said that the judge s surprising decision on tuesday to move immediately to a verdict meant that none had had the time to get back to l neburg but leon schwarzbaum , 94 , like mr gr ning , was on hand although not a plaintiff , he had come especially from berlin to see if justice would be done born in hamburg in 1921 , transported to auschwitz from a polish ghetto in 1943 , mr schwarzbaum said he lost 30 relatives in the holocaust he survived auschwitzbirkenau , buchenwald , sachsenhausen and at least one other camp mr schwarzbaum said afterward that , although too long delayed , justice had been served for decades , the german legal system made it difficult to prosecute former ss members and camp guards if there was no direct evidence linking them to the mass killings of the holocaust but the case of john demjanjuk , a ukrainian who immigrated to the united states after world war ii , changed that a former autoworker , he was eventually extradited and sentenced in munich in 2011 to five years in prison for his involvement in the killing of 28 , 000 jews at the sobibor camp in nazioccupied poland he died in 2012 , before his appeal could be heard this opened the path for prosecutors in to charge aging former camp personnel with complicity in the holocaust among those who helped pioneer the shift in german legal thinking was mr walther , a former judge who went to work in 2006 for germany s central office for tracking nazi war crimes , based in ludwigsburg mr walther and his colleague cornelius nestler represented 51 of the 65 plaintiffs some of the survivors had directly confronted mr gr ning with their memories in searing testimony hedy bohm , 87 , told the court that she had never expected the chance to appear as a witness at the trial of one of her german persecutors but most of all , she said , she wanted to hear mr gr ning say three little words i am sorry he uttered them , but attached such qualifications that , she said , the apology would in fact not be enough several of the other plaintiffs said that what they sought was an apology and a legal judgment as eva fahidi , 90 , put it , it was not a matter of sending an old man to live out the rest of his days in a jail as much as getting a formal acknowledgment of the unspeakable pain the nazis had inflicted she lost 49 relatives mr walther said that mr kompisch and his two judges had clearly listened closely to the plaintiffs' account of how they were violently uprooted from homes across hungary and delivered into what the judge described as a naziperfect construct that hid behind euphemisms and a bureaucratic division of labor the judge went into excruciating detail on the threeday rail transports to auschwitz and the sorting of prisoners into two groups those saved to work and the masses stripped of their last possessions and gassed in his final statement to the court on july 7 , mr walther virtually assumed the identities of the hungarian jews he represented we survivors of auschwitz have the right to accuse and , for our murdered families , we have the duty to do so , he said we accuse because of time , which heals no wounds but instead burns them deeper into our souls
helmut schmidt , the former west german chancellor who marshaled personal dynamism , managerial brilliance and often acidtongued impatience to push his country into an assertive international role as the cold war dragged on into the 1970s , died on tuesday at his home in hamburg he was 96 his death was confirmed by teresa maria frei , spokeswoman for the weekly newspaper die zeit , where mr schmidt was copublisher in a statement , chancellor angela merkel said she had visited mr schmidt at his home less than a year ago and praised him as a source of advice and judgment i valued mr schmidt , a social democrat , had not shied from criticizing policies put forth by her as leader of the conservative christian democratic union party mr schmidt was for decades one of west germany s most popular politicians with a firm jaw and intense gray eyes , he was handsome , witty and supremely selfpossessed in public he was a magnetic speaker and a pugnacious debater \( he was known as schmidt the lip early in his career \) cultured and erudite , he was also an accomplished classical pianist and author as recently as 2013 , in a poll by , he was ranked as s most significant chancellor we germans have lost a father figure , said foreign minister frankwalter steinmeier , one of a generation of social democratic leaders formed by mr schmidt and willy brandt mr schmidt s life all but traced the history of 20thcentury a son of workingclass hamburg , he was born in the wake of germany s humiliating defeat in world war i , witnessed the nazis' rise , joined the hitler youth , served in hitler s army hiding the fact that he had a jewish grandfather and emerged politically in a postwar germany divided against itself elected in 1974 , mr schmidt rode a difficult period as chancellor the global economy was in turmoil , and tensions with the communist east had not slackened unlike his more accommodating predecessors , he jousted with the united states over global economics and relations with the soviet union he barely concealed his disdain for president jimmy carter , a novice in international affairs , and his wariness of a bellicose president ronald reagan at home , he compelled his leftleaning social democratic party to embrace probusiness policies and to support the buildup of the west german armed forces into a bulwark of the north atlantic treaty organization at the same time , he pressed the federal republic of germany to forge closer ties with the communist regime in east germany and working with his close friend president val ry giscard d'estaing of france , he helped soften european distrust of his country for its nazi past , still fresh in painful memory \( meanwhile , a almost to the end of his life , he was the only public figure in germany allowed to disregard smoking bans \) mr schmidt made grievous policy errors , which were compounded by his unwillingness to admit mistakes and a seeming disregard for diplomacy , with foes and allies alike they were failings that led the bundestag , germany s parliament , to dismiss him after eight years in office his detractors accused him of being overwilling to assuage moscow in his desire to salvage d tente , an effort , embraced by west germany and france , to ensure peace through stronger political and economic ties with moscow moreover , his intemperate criticism of washington promoted neutralist , antiamerican tendencies in the social democratic party , which only helped undermine his chancellorship mr schmidt was confident too confident , some said about his ability to sustain prosperity in west germany under his stewardship , his nation fared better than the rest of europe during the economic crisis of the 1970s , provoked by a sharp rise in petroleum prices controlled by opec , the cartel of oilexporting countries but he was criticized in the early '80s as having failed to prepare west germans for recession still , mr schmidt remained popular , owing in no small part to the affection west germans had for his downtoearth wife , a biologist and amateur botanist , she eschewed ceremony in favor of promoting conservation and protecting endangered plants flowers in latin america and africa were named after her , and she wrote or cowrote books on plants and ecology she died in 2010 at 91 mr schmidt might have been able to survive politically if he had antagonized opponents less but in the bundestag he was resented for his attacks on legislators who disagreed with him in 1982 , a parliamentary majority voted him out of office by passing a noconfidence motion and replaced him with helmut kohl , leader of the conservative christian democratic party it was the first time that the bundestag had removed a german chancellor since the end of  even after his downfall , mr schmidt was unapologetic in a 1986 speech , on his retirement from the bundestag , he noted that unemployment had continued to climb under chancellor kohl then , facing mr kohl , he said that the real jobless rate would be a little higher if you had n't manipulated the numbers a little downward nearing retirement , mr schmidt spent much of his time in hamburg , his native port city he wrote a memoir and other books as well as articles in which he defended his outspoken exchanges with american presidents i have always regarded myself as a reliable friend of the united states , but never have i misunderstood an alliance to be a system of control and command , he said in a 1984 interview with the new york times it s rather a system of advice and consent , if i may borrow a phrase from your constitution helmut heinrich waldemar schmidt was born on dec 23 , 1918 , in barmbek , a workingclass district of hamburg his father , gustav , was a schoolteacher his mother , ludovica , was an artistically gifted homemaker behind this facade of bourgeois rectitude there was a family secret , one he revealed long afterward i had a jewish grandfather , he told at the end of a lengthy interview in 1984 by falsifying documents , he said , he and his father had hidden the truth from the nazis with hitler rising to power in 1933 , helmut schmidt joined the hitler youth , and in 1937 he was drafted into the german army after the war began in 1939 , he became a first lieutenant in an antiaircraft artillery battery on the russian front and was awarded the iron cross he and hannelore glaser , known as loki , married in 1942 they had known each other since they were schoolchildren they had a daughter , susanne after the war , mr schmidt obtained a degree in political economy at the university of hamburg , and his wife became a schoolteacher while still a student , he joined the social democratic party and took a job in hamburg s municipal government in 1948 five years later , he was elected to the bundestag in bonn , the west german capital early on he established himself as a conservative , pragmatic maverick in the leftleaning social democratic mainstream he backed west german rearmament in the 1950s , for instance , while most party members opposed it bored with the bundestag , he returned to hamburg in 1961 and became the city s interior minister early the next year , while the mayor was away on vacation , mr schmidt vaulted into national prominence by supervising the emergency response to a calamitous flood in which at least 300 people drowned , victims of heavy winds that had swept over the coast and sent a swollen elbe river pouring over its dikes even after the mayor hurried back to the city , mr schmidt relegated him to the sideline while remaining in charge on the ground \( in her statement , chancellor merkel , a native of hamburg , warmly described a childhood memory of mr schmidt in command of rescue efforts \) mr schmidt returned to the bundestag in 1965 and became an expert on defense policy he also drew closer to the views of mr brandt , the social democratic party leader , who wanted to normalize relations with east germany in 1969 , after the social democrats gained power , chancellor brandt named mr schmidt defense minister , and any lingering doubts about the willingness of the antimilitarist social democrats to reconcile themselves with the armed forces vanished military spending rose , weaponry was modernized , and mr schmidt embraced the united states military presence in europe mr schmidt was named finance minister in 1972 and promptly sought to make leftwing social democrats understand that west germany s openarmed social benefits could be financed only by a thriving capitalist economy he also , crucially , developed a friendship and alliance with his french counterpart , mr giscard d'estaing one that would determine the balance of power in western europe they seemed mismatched mr giscard d'estaing was tall , aristocratic and politically conservative mr schmidt was short , devoid of social pretensions and leader of a centerleft party but both had lightning intelligence , technical expertise and a proclivity to believe they were always right most important , they shared a vision of western europe under frenchgerman leadership achieving economic integration mr schmidt s path to the pinnacle of power was cleared in 1974 , when mr brandt resigned in a scandal in which a close adviser had been revealed to be an east german spy a few days later , on may 16 , 1974 , mr schmidt became the fifth chancellor of the federal republic of germany his first trip abroad was to paris , to meet with the new french president , mr giscard d'estaing unable to speak each other s language , they conversed in english frenchgerman unity had been a cornerstone of west european postwar policy the prevailing view was that west germany offered economic strength while france lent a confident voice on foreign affairs one that west germans , hesitant to speak out so soon after the hitler era , eagerly welcomed the more pragmatic , if not cynical , take on the relationship was that it allowed the french to keep close tabs on a historic rival and germans to rid themselves of the nazi stigma the schmidtgiscard d'estaing bond went beyond pragmatism , however they spoke often by phone and made unannounced visits to each other at international conferences they usually sat side by side , whispering to each other as they shaped common positions together they pushed for the establishment of the european council , in which heads of governments met regularly they backed the european monetary system , which in 1999 led to a common currency , the euro , for members of the european union mr schmidt also had early successes at home his government was skillful in handling the sharp rise in oil prices that began in 1973 , and despite a huge bill for oil imports , the country built a record trade surplus he also proved effective in dealing with a west german terrorist group , the red army faction , whose ranks were decimated by arrests after the kidnapping and killing of a german industrialist , hannsmartin schleyer , in 1977 mr schmidt emerged with the highest public opinion ratings of any german politician since the first postwar chancellor , konrad adenauer meanwhile , friction was growing between the united states and west germany one cause of unease in bonn was a perception that president carter , elected in 1976 , was inexperienced and unpredictable personally , he was a very nice man , mr schmidt said in his 1984 interview with the times magazine but you could n't depend on his carrying through what he had agreed with you to do the most contentious question was how to cope with the arsenal of soviet ss20 nuclear missiles aimed at western europe in december 1979 , nato decided to install american nucleararmed pershing and cruise missiles in several western european countries by 1983 unless the soviets agreed to remove their ss20 missiles mr schmidt , defying opponents in his own party , agreed to base the bulk of the american weapons in west germany but he complained that washington failed to understand how critical it was to overcome west germans' vehement opposition to the missiles think of a situation where an american administration puts 5 , 000 nuclear rockets in oregon a state roughly the size of west germany and makes plans for adding some hundreds more that could hit the soviet union and thereby make oregon a great target area for soviet missiles , he said in a 1982 times interview the euromissile talks were suspended after the soviet union invaded afghanistan in 1979 and mr carter decreed a grain embargo and a boycott of the 1980 summer olympics in moscow in europe , only west germany , monaco , norway and turkey honored the boycott though mr schmidt went along with it , he grumbled that american officials had assured him several times that no boycott would be called relations between washington and bonn did not improve after reagan denied mr carter a second term in 1980 early on , reagan took a hard line toward the soviet union and scared europeans by suggesting that the west could win a limited nuclear war meanwhile , setbacks at home and abroad had begun sapping mr schmidt s power in france , mr giscard d'estaing lost his reelection bid in 1981 , and though his successor , fran ois mitterrand , a socialist , had links to west german social democrats , he and mr schmidt had a cool relationship mr mitterrand suspected that mr schmidt had supported mr giscard d'estaing in the election at home the economy was in trouble signs of stagnation had appeared when mr schmidt won reelection in 1980 , but he had not issued warnings soon recession set in , unemployment rose , and the public was angry leftwing social democrats pressed for more state ownership of banks and industry , wider social benefits and subsidies to create jobs measures anathema to mr schmidt and suddenly he was out , on a noconfidence vote in the bundestag on oct 1 , 1982 , mr kohl , the christian democratic party leader , replaced him mr schmidt was furious legislators , he said , had broken precedent by not waiting for a general election your conduct is legal , but it has no inner , no moral justification , he said in the bundestag the christian democrats blamed the social democrats for mr schmidt s fall none of us spoke so insultingly about you as did some of your own people , one conservative politician said to him the country s rightward shift was confirmed in 1983 , when mr kohl s conservative coalition trounced the social democrats in a general election mr schmidt s survivors include his daughter , susanne , a television producer in london and ruth loah , his longtime assistant , who was introduced as his companion in 2012 a son born in 1944 , helmut walter , died in infancy out of power , as copublisher of die zeit , mr schmidt enjoyed a platform from which to write about current affairs as a pianist he made recordings of bach and mozart , including with the london philharmonic orchestra nearing 95 , he went to moscow to see old soviet friends and was invited to a chat with president vladimir v putin he regained his high personal standings in the polls and he remained as combative as ever asked to assess his successor , mr kohl , he was characteristically withering i think there are still two or three fields in which he still needs a lot of education , he told the times asked which ones , he answered , international affairs , arms control and military strategy , and economics and finance

' the officers told the demonstrators not to talk to them , and said , this is what you all wanted , right , mr clark said mr clark said he was alarmed by the heavy bulletproof vest that one of the agitators was wearing and by the precision with which he believed they operated they were using police tactics , he said john elder , a spokesman for the police department , said he hoped that people would wait for the facts to emerge regarding the shooting no matter what , some people are going to have their own theories , he said a spokesman for the federal bureau of investigation said it was working with the minneapolis police to determine if federal intervention is warranted after the shooting the shooting encouraged several people to come out to the precinct on tuesday some said they wanted to show that they would not be scared by hate others said they wanted to provide an extra layer of protection i'm here to protest , somewhat , said marques winslow , 36 , who lives about 20 blocks north of the precinct and had not come to previous demonstrations but basically to keep my eyes peeled and try to add some protection that is not going to be supplied by police officers hundreds of people outside the precinct marched downtown on tuesday they had set up tents people passed out candy , pizza , fried chicken and other food they also distributed hand warmers heavy smoke came from woodburning fires and heat lamps set up to keep people warm as the sun set , people started blaring festive music korey dean , who has been a regular demonstrator , said he thought there were more white people among the demonstrators than in the past the shooting , he said , might have united people when people come together for a common cause race , creed , economic background none of that matters , he said some people remained on edge , however people are looking at new faces sideways , because it s scary , said julian condie , 27 , of minneapolis , who has come out to the vigils occasionally the police also said they were aware of a video in which masked men are seen driving to the protest site and brandishing a pistol , while making racist comments and justifying the killing of jamar clark activists have pledged to stay until specific demands are met , including the release of video evidence in mr clark s shooting officials have met two of the demands , agreeing to a federal civil rights investigation into his shooting and releasing the names of the two officers involved the officers involved in the shooting , mark ringgenberg and dustin schwarze , have worked for the minneapolis police department for 13 months , though both have seven years of experience in law enforcement the police said that mr clark was a suspect in an assault and that he had interfered with paramedics trying to treat his victim when officers arrived , the police said , he fought with them , leading to the gunfire they have disputed witness accounts that mr clark was handcuffed when he was shot
at this time of year , you hear a lot about how some teams are getting hot at the right time , while others are limping into the playoffs most prognosticators would say that the rangers and the cubs \( , through thursday \) are a lot better positioned for the postseason than the astros \( 714 \) so how vital is a strong stretch run to a playoff team \? not at all over the last two decades , the hottest teams going into the playoffs have not fared especially well there , while the coldest have been surprisingly good the 1997 florida marlins were 1215 in september and october regularseason games the 2006 st louis cardinals were 1217 the 2000 yankees were 1318 they all won the world series in contrast , none of the since 1994 , when the playoffs expanded , won the world series only one of them even made it there the three hottest , the 2001 a s \( 234 in september and october \) , the 1995 yankees \( 226 \) and the 2013 indians \( 216 \) , all fell in the first round or the wildcard game as a group , those 10 hot teams looked formidable with the postseason approaching they all had winning percentages of 741 or more in september and october but in the postseason , the teams were mediocre , winning seven series and losing nine as well as a wildcard game their combined record was 4043 the 2011 texas rangers \( 196 down the stretch \) made the world series , where they lost to the cardinals , but the others would all have to be classified as postseason disappointments the hottest of all , the 2001 a s , were a strong 102win team that they went 142 to finish the season , winning games by 112 , 93 , 84 and 94 but they scored just 12 runs in a fivegame division series loss to the yankees faring far better were the coldest teams the top 12 \( including a multipleway tie for 10th \) all had winning percentages in september and october of 444 or below but these supposedly struggling teams were an eyeopening 7053 in postseason games and 178 in playoff series , not including last year s a s wildcard loss in addition to the three world series winners , they include three series runnersup , the 1996 braves \( 1215 \) , the 2006 tigers \( 1216 \) and the coldest team of all , the 1998 padres san diego , which had a big lead in its division , coasted to a 915 record to finish the season , including  but when the time came , the padres snapped out of it , beating houston \( 159 in september and october \) and atlanta \( 168 \) before falling to the yankees so if your team has been sputtering , do not fret one baseball clich remains true the postseason truly is a clean slate

washington the massacre of nine africanamericans in a storied charleston church last week , which thrust the issues of race relations and gun rights into the center of the 2016 presidential campaign , has now added another familiar , divisive question to the emerging contest for the republican nomination what to do with the confederate battle flag that flies on the grounds of the south carolina capitol and like some of their predecessors seeking to win the state s primary , the first in the south , the leading they do not want to risk offending the conservative white voters who venerate the most recognizable emblem of the confederacy and who say it is a symbol of their heritage issued a statement on saturday saying he was confident that south carolina will do the right thing as florida s governor , mr bush in 2001 ordered the confederate flag to be taken from its display outside his state s capitol to a museum where it belonged senator , also of florida , told reporters that he thought the state would make the right choice for the people of south carolina but neither candidate would state explicitly whether he wanted south carolina to stop displaying a flag that is a particularly searing reminder of slavery of wisconsin begged off from questions about what to do with the flag in south carolina or whether it represents racism , saying he would not address any such matters until the victims of the mass shooting were buried even after online pictures of the suspect in the massacre , dylann roof , and a gun surfaced on saturday , none of the candidates who appeared on sunday s political television programs were willing to say flatly whether it should continue to fly at the south carolina capitol the most prominent democratic contender , hillary rodham clinton , said in 2007 that the flag should be removed the carefully calibrated answers were a vivid illustration of the difficulties republicans face in trying to broaden their party s appeal to minorities while also energizing white conservatives the politics of race rests at the most sensitive nerve of the , said bruce haynes , a republican strategist and south carolina native all republicans want to grow their share of the black vote but it s the chicken and the egg mr haynes recalled the example of former gov david beasley of south carolina , a republican who called for the flag to be removed from atop the capitol dome , where it once flew mr beasley s effort won him little black support and a backlash from some whites in his losing bid for reelection in 1998 but while the republican presidential hopefuls are now mostly focused on a heavily white electorate for the primaries and caucuses , an increasingly diverse country looms for the eventual nominee not until three days after it was reported that a young white gunman expressing hostility toward blacks had killed nine worshipers at charleston s historic emanuel african methodist episcopal church , including clementa pinckney , a pastor and state senator , did the republican presidential campaign fully catch up to a country reeling from the gruesome display of racial hatred in the days before , some of the republican candidates complained about president obama s calls for additional gun laws , and others seemed uncertain whether to deem the massacre racially motivated but if the republicans were reluctant to call directly for the flag to come down , they soon realized that they had to speak more plainly about the motivation behind the attack after friday , when mr bush initially seemed reluctant to ascribe the killings to race , his rivals were blunt on the question i want to make it abundantly clear that i think the act , the crime that was committed on wednesday , is an act of racism , mr walker told reporters saturday after he gave a speech to an evangelical group in washington mr rubio called the massacre an act motivated by racial hatred the one highprofile republican who spoke unambiguously about the flag is no longer running for president mitt romney said in a twitter message on saturday , remove it now to honor charleston victims mr romney took a similar position when he ran in south carolina s primary in 2008 but mike huckabee , the former governor of arkansas , who was the runnerup in that contest and is a candidate again in 2016 , suggested at the time that no one from outside the state should dictate what south carolina did with the flag that position , which mr huckabee reiterated sunday on nbc s meet the press , is similar to the posture that both george w bush and senator john mccain took in the 2000 nominating race , which mr bush won not long after mr mccain dropped out of that campaign , he returned to columbia , sc , to admit that he had compromised his principles because he was scared of losing he later wrote in a book that it was one of the worst decisions in his career not to have called for the flag s removal yet mr mccain and mr romney , the previous two republican nominees , are viewed warily by many conservatives , and their opinions are likely to matter little to the current field what may mean more are the views of south carolina s republican leaders , some of whom were saying on saturday that they appreciated the willingness of the candidates to give them space to address the matter one republican legislator is already pushing to take the flag down state representative norman d brannon , who represents a conservative district upstate and was a friend of mr pinckney s , said that he would file a bill in the next session of the legislature to remove the flag from the capitol grounds the flag is kind of like algae in a lake , he said in an interview it s just barely under the surface , everybody knows it s there , but unless something like this happens , nobody talks about it mr brannon spoke bluntly about the effect of the killings on him what lit the fire under this was the tragic death of my friend and his eight parishioners , mr brannon said it took my buddy s death to get me to do this i should feel ashamed of myself he said the presidential candidates should not mince words on the issue the fight over the flag s placement has a long history in south carolina it was originally flown atop the capitol during the administration of gov fritz hollings , a democrat , in 1962 as the civil rights movement gained steam , ostensibly to mark the centennial of the civil war there was a push in the late 1990s to take it down , but the flag continued to fly above south carolina s copperdomed capitol until 2000 , when a bipartisan agreement was reached to move it to a confederate memorial nearby that compromise was widely accepted , said senator lindsey graham of south carolina , a republican presidential hopeful but in light of what has happened , that has to be revisited because the shooter is so associated with the flag in an interview on cnn on sunday , mayor joseph p riley jr of charleston , a democrat , said displaying the flag at the capitol sends , at best , mixed messages and , at worst , he said , for hateful people like roof , it s an affirmation because they have appropriated something and used it as a symbol of hatred so i think that it needs to go into a museum , and i think it will what could prove crucial in determining the flag s fate , and whether the republican presidential candidates will speak more decisively , is the view of senator tim scott of south carolina , the only africanamerican republican in the senate mr scott said on cbs s face the nation on sunday that after a period of mourning , his voice will be clear on the flag issue mr graham is hoping to issue a joint statement with mr scott and gov nikki r haley of south carolina after the victims' funerals that would collectively address the flag s status unless ms haley calls the legislature back into a special session , the state will most likely take up the issue when the next session begins in january shortly before south carolina s presidential primary but many prominent republicans there are privately hoping the state reaches a consensus well before that point to avert a primary dominated by racerelated issues , which could turn off the business community and depress the state s lucrative tourism and convention industry david h wilkins , a republican

berlin it was one of the finest , weirdest series of events in the history of german tv on march 15 g nther jauch , the host of one of s major political talk shows , interviewed the greek minister of finance , yanis varoufakis during the conversation he confronted mr varoufakis with a video of him speaking at a conference in 2013 and literally giving the finger to germany mr jauch meant to expose what he considered an inappropriate tone in the debate , particularly on the greek side germany is paying the most and is criticized the most how does this fit \? he asked the greek minister but mr varoufakis did not answer instead , he claimed the video had been doctored , an allegation mr jauch tried to disprove the next day , presenting evidence provided by several experts saying they could not find traces of manipulation the video threw germany into an uproar then , on march 18 jan b hmermann , a young comedian hosting a latenight show , showed his own video , which seemed to demonstrate that he had doctored the scene for half a day , germany lingered in space , free floating in an ambiguous void , its sympathies divided until finally , the producer responsible for mr b hmermann s show admitted that mr b hmermann s confession was itself a prank , and that mr varoufakis s gesture was real \( though taken out of context \) reality thus restored , germany wiped the sweat off its brow and went back to tv as usual , to cooking and hospital serials however , it s worth briefly dwelling on the episode , variously called fingergate and varoufake both mr jauch s attempt to publicly disgrace mr varoufakis and mr b hmermann s ingenious satire say a lot about greekgerman relations as well as about how the greek debt crisis is changing the way we germans think of ourselves ever since the flashy mr varoufakis came into office , the german media have reported on his every move even more than his boss , the greek prime minister , alexis tsipras , he is seen as a loose cannon , a bespoke bull in the eurozone china shop on his show , mr jauch called mr varoufakis unconventional , the german tv euphemism for pretty crazy , and that s what many marvel at , and despise he has what none of our representatives have \( at least not at once \) a motorcycle , a luxurious apartment , an attractive spouse , eloquence and he even used to be a university professor ! mr varoufakis is the glamorous rebel challenging the establishment of austerity politics all of this stands out in comparison with his german counterpart , wolfgang sch uble an elderly conservative technocrat , mr sch uble is the iron hand on germany s and europe s budgets , a family man from badenw rttemberg , a state best known in the rest of germany for its singsong dialect and reputation for tidiness he s as german as german can be these are clich s , of course , but they are clich s both men are happy to foster they are the perfect foils for the new german selfconfidence as it emerges in the course of the european debt crisis its main pillars are money , with a capital m , and reliability , with a capital r in the german narrative of the crisis , serves as the antimodel that makes the hero \( us \) look even shinier that we would sometimes secretly rather be the dark rebel ourselves , be more unconventional , more varoufakis , just makes us angrier to be forced into the role of the party pooper but most of the time , germany enjoys its part as the bully of europe it s nice and simple our money , our rules but the new german selfconfidence is threatening to turn into chauvinism when mr varoufakis lied about mr jauch s footage being manipulated , the tabloid newspaper bild came close to bursting with patriotic indignation , which was probably how many felt lying to mr jauch , who also hosts the german version of who wants to be a millionaire \? comes close to a felony who wants those lying greek bums in our , anyway \? given germany s history , greece s response was predictable in the moral blame game of the past weeks , greece hastened to renew its claim for war reparations , refreshing the world s memory of germany s eternal historical debt from world war ii indeed , it s an ironic twist of history that it should be the european union , which was designed in part to prevent a return of german nationalism , that is facilitating this new surge of german feelings of supremacy which means little will come from greece s historical claims within the context of the european union , and for the sake of saving a project awarded the nobel peace prize , germany s chauvinism passes as a good father s inevitable rigor of course there is a glimpse of truth in germany s concern about greece , too when the german chancellor , angela merkel , and mr tsipras met last week , ms merkel adopted a conciliatory tone her desire to save the european union is genuine , as it is for many germans all across the political spectrum germany is oscillating between ms merkel and mr jauch , between embracing the greeks for the best of europe and telling them that , as long as they stick their feet under our table , they will have to eat what s served about half of all germans wish that the greeks stay in the union , and the other half wants them to get out , the polls say with his prank , mr b hmermann managed to make both sides visible at once it was a fine moment , indeed
overview the first transcontinental railroad , completed in may 1869 , connected the cities of the eastern seaboard with the pacific coast more than three thousands miles away like the first lunar landing one hundred years later , the completion of the railroad carried immense symbolism for the united states but it was more than an abstract symbol it also promised to physically transform the nation in this lesson , students use primary sources to answer the question why was the first transcontinental railroad more than just another railroad in the eyes of the nation \? then , in the going further section , we suggest ideas for debating whether the united states should invest in highspeed rail , researching the effect of the first coasttocoast railroad and imagining what life was like for chinese laborers who helped the railroad cross the mountains resources warm up ask students what technological achievement in your lifetime represents more than just another invention \? what is the achievement \? what does it symbolize \? how has it changed how we live \? does it mean different things to different people \? students can write answers to these questions , and then discuss as a class next , explain that in this lesson students will take on the role of historians trying to figure out how people living in 1869 saw the new transcontinental railroad and how it too was more than just another technological achievement background explain to students that the united states finished building the first transcontinental railroad in may 1869 , when the union pacific line met the central pacific tracks in promontory , utah you can have them read the first five paragraphs of may 10 , 1869 first transcontinental railroad is completed from our historic headlines series to provide basic background information before they investigate the primary sources below it begins on may 10 , 1869 , a golden spike was driven at promontory , utah , signaling the completion of the first transcontinental railroad in the united states the transcontinental railroad had long been a dream for people living in the american west while there was a large network of railways built in the eastern part of the country in the 1830s and 40s , there were few in the west and none that connected with eastern lines the western population boom following the california gold rush of 1849 made the need for a transcontinental line apparent next , be sure the class knows the difference between primary and secondary sources before continuing , they should understand the strengths and weaknesses that primary sources offer for historians activity in this activity , students will become historians using primary source documents from the new york times to better understand what the transcontinental railroad meant to the country the first document , a telegram sent by the new york city chamber of commerce , provides a viewpoint of the business community the second document , a sermon by an episcopalian rector at trinity church in manhattan , provides a viewpoint of a pastor the third document , a speech made by the sioux chief red cloud , offers a perspective of a native american chief please note that while the first two sources speak directly about the railroad , the third document refers only to the encroachment of whites on sioux lands , spurred onward by the advancing railroad all three sources are available in one place in this handout \( pdf \) as students read , annotate and gather evidence , they should keep this question in mind why was the first transcontinental railroad more than just another railroad in the eyes of the nation \? students can take notes using this graphic organizer \( pdf \) then , they can discuss what they learned by reading the three documents as part of the discussion , you can push students to consider additional followup questions later , students can consider all these questions in an essay or , if you want to take the activity in a different direction , see the going further section below for additional ideas document 1 excerpt from \( pdf \) , the new york times , may 11 , 1869 congratulatory dispatch

, increase the power , exalt the dignity and perpetuate the unity of our republic , but in its boarder relations , as the segment of a worldembracing circle , directly connecting the nations of europe with those of asia , will materially facilitate the enlightened and advancing civilization of our age by the order of the chamber samuel b ruggles , william e dodge , george opdyke , aa low , special committee document 2 excerpt from \( pdf \) , the new york times , may 11 , 1869 services at trinity church address by rev dr vinton when we contemplate this achievement we can hardly realize its magnitude three thousand two hundred and eightyfive miles of continuous railway within four degrees of latitude and fifty degrees of longitude in the temperate zone it begun when the nation was agitated by war , and is finished now when we enjoy a reign of peace when the route was discovered around the cape of good hope , it was very properly regarded as a blessing of mankind hence the designation by which it is known but the completion of this mighty work , which connects the two oceans , is a still greater blessing in the olden times , when camels those ships of the desert were the means used for transportation , for the furtherance of commercial traffic , it was found that wherever the caravans stopped there would spring up cities and there would be evidences of civilization so with this great work it will populate the vast territory and be the great highway of the nations their merchants will cross it to trade with us but there is another aspect which we view it as a blessing , and in connection with which we esteem of it still greater importance it will preserve the union of these great states philosophers tell us , and we know it to be true , that where there are rivers which diverge of their courses , and have separate and distinct outlets \( as in europe \) , there the nations become diffused , and the people are separated and disunited but where , on the contrary , the topography is such that the rivers all flow into one common central basin , there is necessarily a concentration of interests and of peoples , and that territory is marked out by god to be under one government by the operation of this natural law we must regard it as decreed that there shall ever be a unity of people and government in all that territory which lies between the alleghenies and the rocky mountains beyond these lofty heights , however , we find the rivers diverging , as in europe , and , following the rule that obtains in the old world , there might be a diffusion of interest and a separation of governments in that section of the country divided from us by the sierra nevada and the rocky mountains but this railway counteracts such natural tendency to disunion , has prevented a separation , and binds the states of the atlantic and pacific into one nation roman roads unified and consolidated the roman empire they were made by the ambition of emperors for the necessities of war and commerce but , under divine providence , they were the highways along which the apostles and the missionaries of christ carried the good tidings of salvation to the tribes of the peoples so this pacific railway is a means , under divine providence , for propagating the church and the gospel from this , the youngest christian nation , to the oldest land in the orient , now sunk in paganism and idolatry , and so will revive the worship of the triune god the god of our salvation in the further east , the birthplace of christianity for this we celebrate this great event join me , therefore , in singing an anthem of praise to god , glory to god in the highest on earth peace , good will to men document 3 \( pdf \) , the new york times , june 17 , 1870 red cloud s speech my brothers and my friends who are before me today god almighty has made us all , and he is here to hear what i have to say to you today the great spirit made us both he gave us lands and he gave you lands you came here and we received you as brothers when the almighty made you , he made you all white and clothed you when he made us he made us with red skins and poor when you first came we were very many and you were few now you are many and we are few you do not know who appears before you to speak he is a representative of the original american race , the first people of this continent we are good , and not bad the reports which you get about us are all on one side you hear of us only as murderers and thieves we are not so if we had more lands to give to you we would give them , but we have no more we are driven into a very little island , and we want you , our dear friends , to help us with the government of the united states the great spirit made us poor and ignorant he made you rich and wise and skillful in things which we knew nothing about the good father made you to eat tame game and us to eat wild game ask any one who has gone thorough to california they will tell you we have treated them well you have children we , too , have children , and we wish to bring them up well we ask you to help us do it at the mouth of horse creek , in 1852 , the great father made a treaty with us we agreed to let him pass through our territory unharmed for fiftyfive years we kept our word we committed no murders , no depredations , until the troops came there when the troops were sent there trouble and disturbance arose since that time there have been various goods sent from time to time to us , but only once did they reach us , and soon the great father took away the only good man he had sent us , col fitzpatrick the great father said we must go to farming and some of our men went to farming near fort laramie , and were treated very badly indeed we came to washington to see our great father that peace might be continued the great father that made us both wishes peace to be kept we want to keep peace will you help us \? in 1868 men came out and brought papers we could not read them , and they did not tell us truly what was in them we thought the treaty was to remove the forts , and that we should then cease from fighting but they wanted to send us traders on the missouri we did not want to go on the missouri , but wanted traders where we were when i reached washington the great father explained to me what the treaty was , and showed me that interpreters had deceived me all i want is right and justice i have tried to get from the great father what is right and just i have not altogether succeeded i want you to help me to get what is right and just i represent the whole sioux nation , and they will be bound by what i say i am no spotted tail , to say one thing one day and be bought for a pin the next look at me , i am poor and naked , but i am the chief of the nation we do not want riches , but we want to train our children right riches would do us no good we could not take them with us to the other world we do not want riches , we want peace and love going further 1 highspeed rail compared with the industrialized nations of europe and asia , the united states has been slow to adopt highspeed bullet trains read

want to read the following articles as well 2 the transcontinental railroad s effect in the main activity , we focused on what building the transcontinental railroad meant to the nation but how did the completion of a coasttocoast railroad actually transform the united states \? how did it affect trade and commerce , settlement patterns , wildlife and the environment , native american tribes , travel , and public discourse and intellectual life \? students can research these questions in the new york times and elsewhere , and then design a visual presentation demonstrating the tremendous effect that the transcontinental railroad had on the growth of the united states 3 chinese laborers by 1868 , at least 80 percent of the central pacific work force consisted of chinese laborers the central pacific route included some of the most difficult and dangerous sections of track to build , including tunneling through the solid granite of the sierra nevada what was life like for the laborers who built the railroad \? one way to understand this perspective is through laurence yep s young adult novel dragon s gate , a historical fiction account of life for chinese laborers or ,

washington when the house select committee investigating the 2012 attacks on american government outposts in benghazi , libya , was created , democrats immediately criticized it as a partisan effort to damage the political fortunes of  but representative trey gowdy , the south carolina republican and former federal prosecutor who is the committee s chairman , told fox news at the time i have no friends to reward and no foes to punish we 're going to go wherever the facts take us now , 17 months later longer than the investigation lasted interviews with current and former committee staff members as well as internal committee documents reviewed by the new york times show the extent to which the focus of the committee s work has shifted from the circumstances surrounding the benghazi attack to the politically charged issue of mrs clinton s use of a private email server while she was secretary of state a committee with a stated initial goal of learning more about how four americans , including ambassador j christopher stevens , were killed in libya has created a political whirlwind in washington , affecting not only mrs clinton s presidential campaign , but now also the race for house speaker mrs clinton is scheduled to testify in front of the committee on oct 22 the committee has conducted only one of a dozen interviews that he planned to hold with prominent intelligence , defense department and white house officials , and it has held none of the nine public hearings with titles such as why were we in libya \? that internal documents show have been proposed at the same time , the committee has added at least 18 current and former state department officials to its roster of witnesses , including three speechwriters and an information technology specialist who maintained mrs clinton s private email server top republican aides on the select committee dispute any suggestion that their inquiry , which has already cost more than 45 million , has been partisan or ineffective or that it changed course they say that although have already examined the attacks , the select committee has been able to unearth new information on benghazi because , unlike the other committees , it has a mandate to look across multiple agencies and see the entire elephant , as dana k chipman , the select committee s chief counsel , put it the committee s focus on mrs clinton s email , a republican spokesman said , is a required part of the investigation into what happened in libya secretary clinton s unusual email arrangement with herself has only made it more difficult for the committee to ensure the public record with respect to libya and benghazi is complete , the spokesman , jamal ware , said in a statement on sunday republican committee members and staff members said they had interviewed more than 40 people who were never deposed by congressional investigators for other committees a tally disputed by democrats in an interview last week , mr gowdy defended the committee s work on benghazi and said only two of the people interviewed by the committee were related to mrs clinton s email he said that at one point this spring he told john a boehner , the house speaker , that he feared the task of investigating the email issue would distract from his committee s work now , as the committee prepares to question mrs clinton next week , what mr gowdy feared as a distraction has led to accusations of bias from a former staff member bradley f podliska , an air force reserve officer who began working for the republican staff of the committee in september 2014 but has since been fired , said in an interview that the panel changed its focus this spring , shortly after staff members learned that mrs clinton had exclusively used a private email account as secretary of state , including during the benghazi attacks the committee dismissed major podliska in june , and he has said he plans to file a complaint in federal court about his termination major podliska described an odd encounter with one of his bosses in april keep your head down , major podliska said , recalling what christopher donesa , the committee s deputy staff director , had told him after praising his progress mr donesa paused for a moment , according to major podliska , then added , this is taking a turn major podliska said the committee was becoming focused primarily on the state department , and in particular on mrs clinton republican staff members said major podliska had been dismissed in part because he had demonstrated improper partiality and animus in his investigative work toward mrs clinton and had mishandled classified material , which major podliska disputes but for months , documents and interviews show , the work of the benghazi committee has been affected by delays and dysfunction the process of setting up an electronic system to manage more than 50 , 000 pages of documents that the committee has assembled is still not complete , meaning that staff members sometimes have to search through boxes to find critical pieces of paper an almost comical task , staff members said they have spent months sparring with obama administration agencies trying to get documents , eating up time the committee had planned to use investigating the attacks with the slow progress , members have engaged in social activities like a wine club nicknamed wine wednesdays , drinking from glasses imprinted with the words glacial pace , a dig at representative elijah e cummings , democrat of maryland and the committee s ranking member , major podliska said mr cummings to question the speed of the committee s work at one point , several republican staff members formed a gunbuying club and discussed in the committee s conference room the 9millimeter glock handguns they intended to buy and what type of monograms they would inscribe on them , major podliska said the documents do show that since the march revelations about mrs clinton s email server , the committee has continued to interview officials outside the state department since then 10 intelligence officials including cia operatives who were on the ground in benghazi and four from the department of defense have been interviewed but an approximate tally produced by the democratic minority staff shows that the committee has so far followed up with only a third of the potential witnesses from the intelligence community , none of the six from the white house and fewer than half from the defense department meanwhile , more than 70 percent of the potential witnesses from the state department have been interviewed mr ware said the focus on the state department made sense , regardless of mrs clinton , because it was where the most relevant witnesses worked mr gowdy said in the interview last week that he had pressed mr boehner to have another house committee examine the matter of mrs clinton s emails , but that mr boehner had rejected the request i would have liked nothing more than for the speaker to find another committee , mr gowdy said senior republican officials , who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were discussing confidential conversations , said that mr boehner had long been suspicious of the administration s handling of the attacks and that mrs clinton s emails gave him a way to keep the issue alive and to cause political problems for her campaign but he thought that the task was too delicate to entrust to others and that it should remain with mr gowdy , the former prosecutor late last month , preserving the investigation s credibility became more difficult when representative kevin mccarthy , the house majority leader , inadvertently offered corroboration of democrats' suspicions everybody thought hillary clinton was unbeatable , right \? he but we put together a benghazi special committee , a select committee what are her numbers today \? her numbers are dropping mr mccarthy subsequently withdrew his candidacy for house speaker , citing in part the uproar over those comments representative adam b schiff , a california democrat and a member of the benghazi committee , effectively agreed with mr mccarthy s assessment he has called for the committee to disband clearly , the committee s true interest was not in providing new answers or information about the benghazi attacks , but in damaging secretary clinton , mr schiff said democrats and republicans who remember the watergate and whitewater investigations have said this is not the first time that a committee started off focusing on one issue and ended up looking at another the select committee on the events surrounding the 2012 terrorist attack in benghazi , libya as the panel is officially known was created in may 2014 by a bitterly divided house of representatives , based on an almost entirely mrs clinton had already taken responsibility for the attacks previous congressional investigations into benghazi had already concluded that state department officials had erred in not better securing the diplomatic compound amid reports of a deteriorating security situation the investigations also concluded that the attacks had come with little warning and that it would have been difficult to intervene once they began the investigations generally agree that the administration s postattack talking points a matter of much dispute were flawed but not deliberately misleading democrats began blasting the new effort even before the seven republican members of the let s call this what it is it is nothing more than a political ploy , representative debbie wasserman schultz , democrat of florida and the chairwoman of the democratic national committee , in early may 2014 , while democrats were still debating whether to even fill their five seats on the panel the republicans moved to defuse these criticisms by naming mr chipman as their chief counsel he is a graduate of west point and stanford law school who served as the army s judge advocate general , or the commanding officer of its inhouse lawyers mr chipman began the investigation with a commitment to stay focused on the frontline personnel who were in benghazi before and during the attacks these are people i served with for 10 years , mr chipman said in an interview , referring to his work in the army overseeing military intelligence teams that is what brought me to this committee finding out what happened with these guys specifically , the majority staff members said , they wanted to test claims that there was little the defense department could have done on the day of attacks to have saved the lives of the four americans they also wanted to reexamine how the administration had handled the aftermath of the attacks , including how quickly intelligence reports from benghazi reached top administration officials the investigation was initially organized into three tranches one for events before the attacks , one for the attacks themselves and one for events after in december , in an early sign of bipartisanship , democratic and republican staff members traveled to a marine base in quantico , va , where the committee received briefings on how defense department personnel handle security at american embassies and other overseas facilities they also met with families of the victims of the attacks the staff members , including major podliska , began interviews with officials from the department of defense , the state department and the intelligence community mr chipman said they wanted to learn how did the us government respond to people in distress \? what did they say about what had occurred \? and how did they craft the subsequent narrative , perhaps for political reasons , and is that narrative accurate \? at the end of 2014 , the committee republicans announced an ambitious agenda , including the nine proposed public hearings from january through october with tentative titles such as what happened \? and what should we fix \? still , democrats questioned how much new was being learned they pointed out that many of these interviews were focused on conditions in libya in 2011 , before col , the libyan dictator , was killed and the situation there changed radically none of the committee s new interview subjects has substantiated any of the wild claims republicans have been making , mr cummings said the committee first noticed something unusual in mrs clinton s emails in august 2014 , when documents the state department was handing over showed that she had been using a personal account the staff members assumed that it was only a matter of time before they would see correspondence from her government account this february , the state department gave the committee 300 of mrs clinton s emails that month , in what one committee member described as a very tense meeting , state department officials acknowledged that mrs clinton had not had a government account she had used her private email for all of her official business , leaving open the possibility that her account contained classified information \( having classified information outside a secure government account is illegal \) things changed for the benghazi committee on march 2 , after the new york times of mrs clinton s email account there was a growing sense of opportunity within the committee that this could be a lifeline the committee became relevant again , major podliska said there was a renewed vigor in the investigation major podliska happened to be called to active duty just at that critical moment he was sent to germany for two weeks in march when he returned , he said , he discovered that the committee s threetranche structure had collapsed into a single agencycentric investigation , as it was known internally as a practical matter , the focus was overwhelmingly on one agency the reality was it was the state department , major podliska said in the spring and summer , the committee drew up new lists of targets for interviews that to major podliska and other committee staff members , particularly democrats , seemed to have little to do with benghazi among the targets were bryan pagliano , a state department aide who helped set up mrs clinton s email system , and sidney blumenthal , a friend and informal adviser to mrs clinton who had sent emails to her about libya before and after the attacks the questioning of mr blumenthal and others , in sessions that took place in a closeddoor conference room and frequently lasted seven or eight hours , also ranged far afield of benghazi during one daylong session , mr blumenthal was asked more than 160 questions about his relationship and communications with the clinton family , members based on an interview transcript that included more than 50 questions about the clinton foundation and more than 45 questions related to david brock , who runs a group that defends mrs clinton against political attacks the count by the democratic staff members shows that the committee also asked mr blumenthal more than 270 questions related to his business activities in libya he was helping a private businessman pursue deals there the committee asked him fewer than 20 questions about the benghazi attacks mr blumenthal declined to comment on sunday mr gowdy has defended these questions , saying mr blumenthal s forprofit business pursuits in libya the secretary of state to intervene in libya militarily and suggesting that this intervention contributed to the september 2012 attacks , a claim the democrats dismiss republicans

month proof , he said , that critical materials had emerged because of the committee s efforts but even as these new materials came in , the committee put aside all of its proposed public hearings focused on the attack and never followed up on most of its announced witness interviews with top defense department and intelligence officials mr gowdy said the hearings had been canceled because of objections from intelligence officials about discussing the matters in a public setting republican staff members and mr gowdy said they were confident they had made important progress in understanding what happened in benghazi tentative findings , they said , include new details that might undercut defense department assertions that nothing could have been done in time to save mr stevens and the others they added that those details would be made public at the end of the inquiry now , with her testimony before the committee imminent , mrs clinton has turned its work to her favor only days after mr mccarthy s assertion that the committee succeeded in driving down her poll numbers , her campaign
amman , jordan in the hostage crisis unfolding in , the country s sofar steadfast support for the americanled coalition fighting the islamic state may yet become collateral damage popular anger over jordan s role in the coalition bombing campaign in syria burst into the open in recent days when it appeared that the fate of a captured jordanian fighter pilot was taking a back seat to that of a japanese journalist , kenji goto , also being held hostage by the militants when a video that appeared to be of mr goto surfaced online tuesday , he was shown holding a photograph of the jordanian pilot mr goto said they would both be killed by the islamic state militants on wednesday if jordan did not give in to their demand to release an attempted suicide bomber from prison the extremists seemed to be offering mr goto his freedom in the deal , while all they were offering the pilot , first lt moaz alkasasbeh , was his life , if that i only have 24 hours left to live , and the pilot has even less , mr goto said in the videotape posted on islamic statelinked twitter accounts , according to the site intelligence group , an organization that tracks jihadist propaganda any more delays by the jordanian government will mean they 're responsible for the death of their pilot , which will then be followed by mine a terse jordanian military communiqu noted that the islamic state was not offering the pilot s freedom , despite the fact they are threatening to kill both hostages together the deadline of the latest threat was due to expire wednesday afternoon , jordanian time there was no official confirmation that the video released tuesday was from the islamic state , but its format resembled a video released of mr goto over the weekend that the militants later confirmed was theirs that video announced the death of another japanese hostage lieutenant kasasbeh became the first coalition soldier to be taken prisoner by the islamic state and , if killed , would be the first coalition fighter to have his life taken in the international intervention , which began with a bombing campaign in august three american soldiers have died from accidents and nonhostile causes , none of them in syria many jordanians have started saying that the fight with the islamic state , also known as or isil , should not have concerned them in the first place this is not our war against isis , said hind alfayez , a member of parliament she added that if lieutenant kasasbeh was an israeli soldier or an american , everyone would be talking about his release , but he s not the fate of the 26yearold pilot had transfixed jordan even before it was linked to that of mr goto handsome and personable , lieutenant kasasbeh was wellregarded by the american military members who worked with him he comes from a powerful tribe in the city of karak , raising the domestic political risks in the case king abdullah visited lieutenant kasasbeh s family the day after his plane went down in late december the militants later disseminated humiliating pictures of the lieutenant , naked from the waist down , that caused widespread anger in jordan a cloak of secrecy dropped over the case in jordan , but his family said it had been expecting lieutenant kasasbeh to be released in exchange for , who was convicted and sentenced to death in 2006 for her role in an attack on amman hotels in 2005 that killed more than 57 people and is known locally as jordan s 9 11 \( while three coconspirators died , including ms rishawi s husband , her explosive vest failed to detonate \) but last week , the extremists changed their demands for mr goto s release , saying he could go free in exchange for ms rishawi but making no mention of lieutenant kasasbeh that s exactly what they wanted to do , put jordan in an impossible position , said a wellconnected jordanian official , speaking on the condition of anonymity because officials have been banned from commenting on the case publicly making the deal to release the japanese journalist would undermine popular support in jordan for the war against the islamic state not making it would probably cost both men s lives and also hurt support it s a winwin for the islamic state , the official said complicating matters , japan is one of jordan s biggest aid donors and has promised 150 million to help the huge number of syrian refugees in the country bassam almanaseer , head of the international affairs committee in parliament , said the war against the islamic state was not jordan s and warned of a strong backlash if the country made any deal for the japanese hostage s freedom that did not include the release of lieutenant kasasbeh like many jordanians , mr manaseer did not challenge the idea of making a swap that gave ms rishawi her freedom so long as the pilot was set free king abdullah has been a strong supporter of the international coalition against the islamic state his country is one of six arab nations fighting with the united states in syria , and one of only four arab states engaging in airstrikes domestic criticism of that has been muted , in part because of the frequent jailing of those who criticize jordanian policy , but that changed in recent days on tuesday night , a crowd of several hundred in amman chanted slogans criticizing the king , a crime , and supporting lieutenant kasasbeh s release japanese and jordanian officials said they were working together to win the safe release of both men mr goto s latest message was addressed to his government and his wife tell the japanese government to put all their political pressure on jordan , he said any more delaying tactics will simply see both of us getting killed among the protesters on tuesday were lieutenant kasasbeh s father and mother when he joined the air force , i expected him to defend jordan , but not to go fight in another country , his mother said this is not our business being there
kabul , afghanistan afghan officials reported two crashes of military flights on monday , one involving a small plane and the other a transport helicopter the disclosures came as the coalition in identified those killed in a helicopter crash the day before as two british service members , two americans and one french contractor the recent string of military crashes officials say none involved enemy fire comes at a time when transport flights have taken on increased importance in as widespread offensives have choked off many of the country s major roadways in monday s crashes , two pilots were killed and five passengers were injured when a small afghan military transport plane struck a mountain ridge while delivering the body of a dead soldier in central bamian province , officials said and in the eastern province of logar , a transport helicopter carrying afghan troops between districts made an emergency landing that left two crew members injured the crash on sunday of the nato helicopter , identified as a puma mk 2 operated by the british , was the second this month by a nato aircraft a united states military c130 plane crashed shortly after takeoff in eastern afghanistan on oct 3 , killing six american service members and several civilians the government says 13 of the country s 34 provinces have faced intense fighting over the last six months in many cases , the afghan forces have been able to resupply and reinforce their troops only by air , or have had to fight their way through enemy territory the reinforcements for kunduz , the first major city to fall to the taliban after 14 years , were by several days as the taliban blocked the highway in baghlan province , south of kunduz city afghan army forces coming from the northern province of balkh , as well as from kabul , were repeatedly ambushed in baghlan before they could reach kunduz to begin an operation to retake the city on monday , the taliban managed to block the country s biggest arterial road , highway 1 , for several hours in ghazni province , according to the deputy provincial governor , mohamed ali ahmadi in one area , they had blown up the bridge in other areas they tried to block the roads and use the traveling civilians as a shield , mr ahmadi said the districts around the city of ghazni have come under repeated assault in recent weeks , as the insurgents , bolstered by the fall of kunduz , seem to be moving to a strategy of focusing on major cities many officials fear that ghazni , long vulnerable with pockets of insurgency in several districts , could be one of the next targets for the taliban mr ahmadi said that the roads to several districts were blocked and that people s movement in the city was limited , but that reinforcements , from the army as well as from police special forces , had arrived in the province there is a threat , without a doubt , mr ahmadi said they have attacked 15 of our check posts , but we have been able to resupply our soldiers on time and had set up several ambushes therefore , the enemy could not make any progress or overrun any check post the united nations said a member of the group s mission in southern kandahar province , toorpaki ulfat , was killed on monday by gunmen riding on motorcycles nicholas haysom , the head of the united nations mission in afghanistan , described ms ulfat , who had worked for the organization for five years , as a respected human rights defender her commitment was not dimmed by the challenging security environment , mr haysom continued she represented the best of what afghan youth have to offer
irving , tex it was 72 hours after the had won a thrilling playoff game against the , and jerry jones , the team s owner , president , general manager and chief cheerleader , was beaming tired , but beaming the cowboys not only advanced to the divisional round of the playoffs against the in green bay on sunday , but they also won at home during the postseason for only the second time in 18 years that , at least , is what the box score said but to jones , the nfl s most irrepressible salesman , dreamer and entrepreneur , the victory was also the culmination of a decadelong vision to turn dallas into the center of the sports world and att stadium into a magnet for what he calls iconic events since it opened in 2009 , the stadium , which cost 12 billion , has hosted a , an nba allstar game , marquee boxing and soccer matches , the ncaa final four and bigname concerts on monday , the stadium s list of firsts will add the inaugural college football playoff championship game , between ohio state and oregon but until sunday , the cowboys , the building s main tenant , were rarely participants on the list of unforgettable games at the stadium the cowboys finished 88 the last three seasons , getting knocked out of the playoff hunt in the last game of the season each time the years immediately before that stretch were not always kinder after beating the philadelphia eagles in a wildcard game at home in the 2009 season , they were trounced by the vikings in minnesota the cowboys' stirring and controversial victory against the lions allowed jones to exhale to me , sunday was a real culmination of frankly a dream , to have a game of that quality , to have our team taking a step like that , as well as having played in that stadium , jones said while sitting on a sofa in his office , the team s five super bowl trophies the last won nearly two decades ago on a shelf nearby i just had to stand there while everyone was sitting there screaming after the last sack , and i just had to soak it in with the cowboyspackers game on sunday and the college football championship the next day , jones seemed at midweek to be conserving his energy before another whirlwind began as soon as the cowboys and the packers finish playing sunday afternoon , jones and his wife , gene , will race back to dallas to host a party at 7 pm for college football dignitaries at the cowboys' practice site wednesday , jones nursed an iced tea , his voice a bit hoarse he preferred to chew over the playoff victory rather than talk about the coming game perhaps it was superstition , or perhaps it was the reality that the packers have a perfect record at lambeau field this season and are 6point favorites sunday i just ca n't describe the combination of having that 91 , 000 people sitting there cranking it up and living and breathing and dying and coming back to life , jones said that was something that you dream about a born showman who cannot help attracting attention , jones chuckled about the series of small earthquakes that occurred the day before perhaps aptly , irving was the epicenter of the tremors he marveled at how he and his team had turned into a national lightning rod , thanks to of new jersey in jones s luxury box for the lions game an unabashed cowboys fan , christie was ridiculed for rooting for a rival of one of the two nfl teams that play in his home state his awkward nationally televised celebration with jones and jones s son , stephen , was lampooned christie s political opponents are questioning the ethics of his having accepted transportation and tickets jones shrugged i think it is a big plus , not a minus , and it adds a lot of flair to what we 're doing , he said things like this are humorous relative to the things they do every day jones invited christie and his bright orange lucky sweater to sit with him in green bay the governor accepted the offer but said he would this time the kerfuffle seemed to symbolize how the cowboys , with their five super bowl titles and their selfproclaimed nickname , america s team , remain a franchise that many fans love to hate the cowboys' power led some fans to posit that jones had influenced the officials' decision against dallas at a key point in the fourth quarter of its victory over detroit ever the optimist , jones considered this a sign of respect fans do not hate teams that are boring or unsuccessful they pity them that is a compliment , to even think you could have that kind of influence , jones said only a few years after jones bought the cowboys in 1989 for what was then a record 140 million , they won three championships they have won none in the last 19 years , much to the glee of the team s detractors for jones , the inability to return to the super bowl is a source of unending frustration for all his success at turning the cowboys into one of the most valuable sports franchises in the united states , jones , 72 , cannot get the one thing he really wants another vince lombardi trophy for that shelf so he has poured a lot of his energy into the thing he can control , att stadium jones has spent an estimated 100 million on additional improvements , a considerable sum for a building so new that includes upgraded wifi inside and outside he has also continued to seek marquee events to host total exclusivity just adds to the cachet of the stadium , he said obviously , we 're going to have a lot more playoff games , but not necessarily the first one jones is considered one of the most powerful nfl owners not just because he owns the richest team , but because he has pushed the league to , as he said , grow the pie by chasing new financial opportunities he also spends countless hours promoting the league , including wooing new owners about a decade ago , he was a guest on a yacht owned by shahid khan , who was looking to buy a team what started out as a conversation turned into a weekendlong gabfest about the merits of investing in the nfl he did n't know me from adam , said khan , now the jacksonville jaguars' owner we stayed up late into the night he s the kind of guy you 'd want to have a beer with he 'll talk and talk jones has often been compared to his friend george steinbrenner , the yankees owner who died in 2010 , because of his championshiporbust attitude , his willingness to reinvest in his team and his showmanship he reminds me of george a lot in that he s completely dedicated to winning , his passion for the cowboys is second to none , and he s smart and creative , said randy levine , the president of the yankees , who are partners with the cowboys in legends hospitality , a stadium concession business but like steinbrenner , jones is sometimes criticized for his ambitions he is , for instance , among only a handful of owners who double as general managers , which means he is criticized when the team does poorly his predilection for the spotlight has turned him into a media celebrity , but he can come across as a camera hog , or worse last year a woman accused him of a 2009 sexual assault , but her civil suit was dismissed in 2009 , commissioner roger goodell fined jones 100 , 000 for suggesting that revenue sharing a cornerstone of the league s financial success was on its way out with some of the deepest pockets of any nfl owner , jones has been chastised for violating salarycap rules , too in 2012 , the redskins and the cowboys were docked millions of dollars in salarycap space after deliberately dumping salaries to gain an unfair competitive advantage the shenanigans speak to jones s competitiveness , as well as his willingness to throw his money around but money , he knows , will never erase his frustration at not being able to get what he most wants another championship i would n't embarrass you or anybody to give you the size of the check i 'd write if i could buy a super bowl , he said it would probably be my largest investment ever , but that s not the way it works
beijing a group of foreign tourists , including a veteran antiapartheid activist from , have been held in a northern chinese jail since last friday after the police accused them of watching terrorist propaganda videos in their hotel , according to family members and consular officials the nine detainees five south africans , three britons and an indian were among a group of 20 tourists stopped at the airport in ordos , a city in the inner mongolia region , as they prepared to board a plane for xi'an , home of s famed terra cotta warriors , according to consular officials and relatives the tourists , many of them affluent muslims of south asian descent , had been on a 47day customized tour of china on wednesday , six members of the group were allowed to board a flight for , according to a spokeswoman for the foreign and commonwealth office in london chinese officials initially said five of the south africans would be able to leave on wednesday , but they later postponed their departure until thursday without explanation , according to relatives none of the remaining nine detainees have been charged with a crime police officials in ordos could not be reached for comment on wednesday the chinese foreign ministry , in a response to faxed questions , said the foreigners were suspected of crimes but did not elaborate china will protect the legitimate rights and interests of the concerned persons in accordance with law , and continue to provide necessary convenience and assistance to foreign embassies for their consular affairs , it said dr imtiaz sooliman , chairman of gift of the givers , a south african aid group that has been working to free the detainees , said family members were planning to hire an international human rights lawyer to hold people without charge for so long is unacceptable , he said by telephone we 're concerned they could be held for several months the detentions come at a time of heightened security in china over what the government contends is a growing threat of islamic extremism on tuesday , the police in another northern city , shenyang , who they said were members of a terrorist organization from the xinjiang region , in far western china the police in shenyang initially claimed the men had shouted jihadist slogans and wielded knives when officers tried to enter their apartment online news articles about the incident , including references to the men as xinjiang terrorists , were later removed from the internet , raising questions about the police accounts of the incident relatives of the detained tourists , among them two prominent doctors from south africa , said any suggestion that they were viewing jihadist videos was nonsensical shameel joosub , the chief executive of vodacom , a leading african telecommunications company , said that three of his relatives on the trip his brother , a corporate executive , and his elderly aunt and uncle were devout muslims but by no means extremists these accusations are completely absurd , he said by telephone we are very stressed out he said that the police had confiscated the cellphones of the detainees and that consular officials did not know about the detentions for two days dr sooliman of gift of the givers suggested that the detentions resulted from a misunderstanding by police officers unfamiliar with islamic practices some of the tourists , he said , were probably listening to quranic verses in their hotel room during ramadan , many muslims do n't watch movies , and knowing the mentality of these people , they would have been listening to recitations from the quran , said dr sooliman , who knows two of the detainees dr feroz suliman , a surgeon at netcare waterfall city hospital in midrand , south africa , and his wife , dr shehnaaz mohamed , a general practitioner these are good people , dr sooliman added to suggest they are terrorists is ridiculous among the detainees is hoosain ismail jacobs , a 74yearold former antiapartheid activist who spent 27 years in exile the detentions coincided with a state visit to china by a group of south african officials that includes deputy president cyril ramaphosa , who met with china s premier , li keqiang , on tuesday , gift of the givers called on the visiting south african officials to ensure that the remaining detainees were promptly released it is inconceivable that a government hosts another government on a state visit and simultaneously incarcerates 10 of its citizens without charge , the statement said the chinese must be told in no uncertain terms to provide the evidence and proof if the south africans have terror links , charge them and take them to trial , alternatively , they must release them immediately and unconditionally
in the hours after sepp blatter announced tuesday that he would resign as president of fifa , world cup sponsors issued statements that read as if one very careful public relations executive had written several versions of the same message that was now so safe to deliver with blatter on the way out only two of the five statements i received even cited blatter , who , after all , was the star of the day all five statements were a variation on the theme of transparency and high ethical standards , which you can never go wrong advocating in the middle of a moral mess none expressed any anger over spending millions of dollars in association with a corruptionplagued organization none offered a detailed prescription for how to right fifa instead , we got the hope that blatter s resignation will accelerate fifa s efforts to resolve internal issues \( budweiser \) and that fifa will continue to act with urgency to take concrete actions to fully address all of the issues that have been raised \( \) we heard the wish that today s news marks a step in the right direction \( adidas \) and that fifa will take swift and immediate steps toward addressing the issues within its organization to quickly rebuild a culture with strong ethical practices \( visa \) not exactly ripsnorting criticism in no instance were top executives of the sponsors available to elaborate on their companies' sentiments or discuss whether their statements might have even been public cover as they privately lobbied blatter to step down cocacola quickly looked past blatter , saying , we respect mr blatter s decision respect the decision , sure , but what about the current fifa scandal \? is n't that worth a comment \? budweiser and mcdonald s took the beautiful game approach , with the latter saying , football has the unique ability to bring the world together while positively impacting communities and economies it sure does but how about delving deeper , even briefly , beyond citing allegations of corruption and questionable ethics \? but real fingerpointing is n't easy in the corporate world through their messages , the sponsors told the soccer world two things first , we 're staying aboard because we want to be there when fifa reforms \( however long that takes \) and second , please , folks , ignore the ugly fifa revelations they are irrelevant to the you much prefer anyway to sepp blatter s news conferences none of these sponsors followed the example of david d'alessandro as a top executive of john hancock life insurance company , he wielded its worldwide olympic sponsorship like a hammer against the calcified bureaucracy and corruption of the international olympic committee after the scandal over the bidding for the 2002 salt lake winter games erupted , he became the ioc s scourge \( and no pal of the usoc , either \) he demanded that juan antonio samaranch , the ioc president , resign he took the olympic logo off john hancock s billboards and advertising he froze the insurer s purchase of 20 million in television time on nbc for the 2000 summer olympics \( which prompted dick ebersol , the head of nbc sports , to say that he was sick of watching this twobit bully get on his soapbox \) rather than simply end hancock s olympic sponsorship , he chose to try to reform the olympics and believes he did , especially in the effort to turn the ioc from opaque to transparent on tuesday , after blatter s announcement , d'alessandro reflected by telephone about a peculiar imbalance of sports power sponsors and networks pay huge sums to outfits like fifa and the ioc , yet fear speaking out boldly when those organizations deserve excoriation let me understand this , he said i'm paying you to borrow your brand and ride on your brand and if your brand is sullied or tarnished , i'm paying to beat myself up \? that makes no sense to me but you have to remember that most corporate bigwigs are cowards at hancock , d'alessandro said , he ran the marketing division before rising eventually to chief executive he granted himself the freedom to speak out but he conceded that other companies could not and cannot respond with bracing candor because sports sponsorship is usually run by middlemanagement executives without much power they spend a fair amount of time justifying the enormous sums they 're spending , so they 're on the defensive most of the time , he said they do n't have the gravitas inside middlelevel sponsorship people ca n't get higherups to speak out and only a ceo can make that call because it means stepping out and by training , most of them are not into public controversy not only that , the names of the sponsors' ceos were not attached to their statements on tuesday , as if the corporations were separate entities able to make safe , inoffensive remarks but maybe some comment is better than none no statements about blatter came from the hierarchy at fox sports , which has the rights to the next three world cups and starts coverage of the women s world cup on saturday but to be fair , fox released a series of comments about blatter s resignation from its women s world cup commentators one of them , alexi lalas , said you saw euphoria , almost , over the past hour when this news came out that s wonderful that s a great step can you imagine the grumbling at fifa s bunker in zurich if eric shanks , the president of fox sports , said \?
london if you are going to confront the specter of a performance that haunts the decades still , it helps to possess a degree of charm that few performers can match that , in brief , is the remarkable achievement of sheridan smith in the muchawaited london revival of funny girl at the menier chocolate factory through march 5 in every way , ms smith , a twotime olivier awardwinner , for the musical legally blonde and the terence rattigan play flare path , could not be further from barbra streisand , who immortalized fanny brice in funny girl on the broadway and london stage and again on film she is neither american nor jewish nor a particular powerhouse of a singer in the inimitable streisand style but what ms smith possesses in marqueeworthy lights is a ready likability , as well as an ability to connect with audiences that cannot be taught in theater school playing brice , the new yorkborn singercomedienne who helped define american showbiz in the first half of the 20th century , ms smith lets her own , very different star power push thoughts of ms streisand to the side ms smith may not deliver the sustained money notes that put the role s originator on the map , but ms streisand surely never mined so much sweetness and pure emotion from the part there will be more to say about the director michael mayer s somewhat cramped production of funny girl when it transfers in the spring to the savoy theater , a larger space that may better suit a staging that looks slightly starved of oxygen at the chocolate factory but for now , one remains in thrall to ms smith s ability to turn a timehonored solo number like people into a study in introspection that elicits tears from the house in its first revival in london since ms streisand herself brought the jule stynebob merrill collaboration here in 1966 , funny girl strikes me as a secondtier musical about not very much that happens to be blessed and not for the first time with a firstrate star i doubt that even ms smith s effortlessly capacious gift for empathy could salvage the season s most ambitious new musical , the inaptly named nd the lower case is intentional , as is the internetfriendly spelling this modernday and very free retelling of alice in wonderland opened last week in the olivier auditorium of the national theater after premiering to mixed reviews at the manchester international festival in july the london iteration feels at least several drafts away from completion in its attempt to marry lewis carroll s lineup of legendary eccentrics \( the dormouse , the caterpillar and so on \) with the coming of age story of a hapless teenager by the name of aly \( get it \? \) played by lois chimimba , a sweetfaced newcomer who is by some measure the best thing about the evening , this bullied , belittled version of carroll s alice takes refuge from her unhappy life in the dreamscape afforded by the internet and so it is that aly soon finds herself with a barbieesque avatar named , of course , alice \( a suitably waxylooking carly bawden \) leading a motley crew of creatures who collectively help our selfloathing heroine i hate being me , aly sings toward the end of the first act embrace her own fabulousness our heroine s realization that empowerment begins within dates back at least as far back as , well , funny girl if only this tale about accepting yourself as you are had an identity of its own instead , as cocreated by rufus norris with the playwright moira buffini \( dinner , handbag \) and the composer damon albarn , better known as the singerkeyboardist of the britpop band blur , wonderland appears to be the result of a computergenerated algorithm about how to appear theatrically hip for the real thing , all concerned might want to treat themselves to tickets for something genuinely revolutionary , like , say , hamilton on broadway early on , there is much banal commentary about the sense of togetherness that comes with life online , as well as the ease with which cyberspace allows people to reinvent themselves please ask , who s behind your mask \?

it s good to bring new names into musical theater , especially in britain , where the art form is drastically in need of fresh voices but mr albarn s score for wonderland busily plunders lionel bart here and a snatch of gilbert and sullivan there , quickly belying its supposed originality visually , the hyperextravagant , projectionheavy design conjures up a watery , nonetooattractive netherworld that makes the enterprise appear to be taking place inside an aquarium wonderland is the first show in ages that may leave the audience wanting to go for a swim the spirit of carroll is far better served by the london debut of you for me for you , the koreanamerican playwright mia chung s dizzyingly intricate portrait of two sisters from north korea , at the royal court theater s studio space through jan 9 the play was first staged at the woolly mammoth theater company in washington in 2012 , but it is hard to imagine the kaleidoscopic script more effectively realized than it has been here the younger sibling , junhee \( katie leung \) , escapes across the border and eventually makes it to the united states , leaving her ailing sister minhee \( wendy kweh \) at home amid the kimjongilia that , believe it or not , is a species of begonia named in honor of the nation s onetime leader kim jongil as is probably apparent , the play benefits from the singularity of its subject how often is north korea brought to life on any stage \? ms chung goes a clever step further by suggesting that events in the 90minute play may not be what they seem , set as they are in a hermit country that comes with its own code of conduct and obfuscating patterns of speech in one scene , minhee visits a doctor only to be informed by him that it is my unique and special privilege to shepherd you to robust health using the most advanced medical solutions and technology known to man the fact that her condition is worsening seems to get lost amid the jargon jon bausor s dazzling design , consisting of a mirrored hexagonal container that generates a shapeshifting surprise or two , heightens the feeling of a gathering disorientation at every turn the visuals are abetted by video work from tal rosner that finds the dal esque pulse in a narrative that sets the personal alongside the political throughout richard twyman s direction is of a piece in its ability to reposition a forbidding regime so that it takes on its own freewheeling theatrical life the production , its chosen terrain notwithstanding , is a thing of wonder directed by michael mayer directed by rufus norris directed by richard twyman
mayag ez , pr the first visible sign that the health care system in was seriously in trouble was when a steady stream of doctors more than 3 , 000 in five years began to leave the island for more lucrative , less stressful jobs on the mainland now , as puerto rico faces another hefty cut to a popular program and grapples with an alarming shortage of funds , its health care system is headed for an allout crisis , which could further undermine the island s gutted economy on an island where more than 60 percent of residents receive or an indicator of puerto rico s poverty and rapidly aging population the dwindling funds have set off outpourings of concern among patients and doctors , protest rallies and intense lobbying in washington and while the crisis is playing out most vividly today , its cause dates back decades and stems , in large part , from a vast disparity in federal funding for health care on the island compared with the 50 states this disparity is partly responsible for 25 billion of puerto rico s , as its government was forced to borrow over time to keep the medicaid program afloat , according to economists these are a cascade of cuts that will have disastrous , gigantic implications , said dennis rivera , the chairman of the puerto rico healthcare crisis coalition , a group of doctors , hospitals , health care advocates , unions and insurance companies lobbying the obama administration and congress health care in puerto rico is headed for a collapse he added , if we pay the same taxes and taxes , we should be treated equally in january , the federal government is supposed to cut payments to plans in puerto rico by 11 percent the plans , offered by private companies , are a popular alternative to medicare , often providing extra benefits and accessibility threequarters of the medicare population on the island is enrolled in advantage , and patients , many of them poor and chronically ill , worry about the impact of the cuts on costs and benefits the cuts are expected to lead to higher copays for medication and hospitalization , among other things , said dr richard shinto , the president and chief executive of innovacare , an insurance company with three advantage plans in puerto rico there will also be certain services we might have provided in the past that we ca n't now , dr shinto said free rides to doctor s offices are an example in addition , several hundred doctors are already losing their contracts with major managed care companies innovacare has terminated 200 contracts , dr shinto said that s one way on the island we are trying to manage the significant revenue reductions we 're to have narrow our network of physicians , he added this is in part because of how doctors practice here they tend to be in solo practices , making it difficult to meet all requirements lower funding levels also complicated efforts to meet standards the island s medicaid program called mi salud , or my health serves nearly 16 million people , or 45 percent of the island s population , the largest share in the united states , and it is also struggling , said ricardo rivera , the executive director of the puerto rico health insurance administration , which carries out the medicaid program health care makes up 20 percent of the puerto rican economy , which has been in a slow decline as manufacturing jobs have disappeared and the government has borrowed more than it could pay back because of the island s precarious finances , the medicaid program lacks access to credit and is so short on cash that it owes providers 200 million , a figure it has whittled down from 350 million it is also spending a onetime 64 billion federal grant at a much faster pace than expected , mr rivera said the medicaid program , which relies on both federal and commonwealth funds , could run out of the grant money as early as the end of 2016 , three years earlier than anticipated , mr rivera said this could mean that 900 , 000 people will have to be dropped from the program puerto rico cannot use the federal exchange under the affordable care act , and it chose not to create its own exchange because its citizens do not pay federal income taxes and thus are not eligible for the subsidies that make exchange plans more affordable a spokesman for the centers for medicare and medicaid services said the agency was aware of the growing concerns and was working weekly with a group of politicians , health care officials , advocates and insurance companies here to find solutions so far , none have been offered the reduction in medicare advantage funding is meant to bring federal payments for that program more in line with traditional medicare feeforservice rates in puerto rico advantage plans on the mainland have received cuts in recent years for the same reason , although generally not as big but puerto rican officials and health care experts have long criticized the federal formula for calculating its feeforservice rates as unfair , and point out that even the virgin islands , a much smaller commonwealth , gets considerably more money for advantage puerto rican lawmakers and doctors warn that it will be more expensive for the united states to ignore the problem for one reason those who need medical care can quickly settle with relatives on the mainland , where it is pricier my message to the federal government is simple if you continue to treat americans living in puerto rico poorly , they will exercise their rights and move to the us mainland , where they will immediately be entitled to equal treatment , said pedro r pierluisi , puerto rico s nonvoting delegate in the house of representatives sitting in the waiting room of his doctor s office in this large , poor puerto rican city , santos de hoyos , one of the 275 , 000 patients who are on both medicare advantage and medicaid , said he was bracing for higher copays for medication at 63 , he has a heart ailment , and and takes numerous medications , including one that costs 150 per dose if the medical plan stops covering it or i lose the plan , i die , said mr de hoyos , a former worker at a canned tuna factory i am praying that god puts his hands into this mr de hoyos typifies the health care challenges facing puerto rico , which has among the highest rates of and in the united states the same is true of mayag ez , a city that once relied on manufacturing but now depends greatly on the health care industry there are health conditions on the island that are just mindblowing , said sara rosenbaum , a professor of health law and policy at george washington university you 've got a tremendous burden of poor health , tremendous costs , a tremendously dependent population and a medicaid program whose percapita payment is a fraction of the us percapita rate in san juan , the puerto rican capital , beds in hospital emergency rooms line the hallways there are so few nurses that people often hire their own private nurses during hospital stays doctors , too , are preparing themselves medicare advantage allows us to live and pay our bills , said dr carlos rom n , a here and the companies are not going to cut into their profits they will cut into our pay and limit treatments , services and medicine dr luis r vicenty , 55 , a longtime mayag ez internist , recently received termination letters from two advantage companies like many doctors from the island , a group that is welltrained , boardcertified and bilingual , dr vicenty received a job offer on the mainland , at a hospital in washington state the crush of doctors who have left has created a serious shortage of specialists most medical school graduates do not even bother looking for jobs here almost none are available , and those on the mainland typically pay double doctors can leave , dr vicenty said so this will get worse easy solutions to the health care crisis do not exist , mostly because it stems from the disparity in funding , something that only congress can change mr pierluisi has introduced legislation to address some of the problems puerto rico s health care woes began in 1968 , when congress placed a cap on medicaid in the united states territories that sharply limited the federal government s contribution for medicaid , this means that puerto rico typically gets 373 million a year from the federal government and has to pick up the rest of the 25 billion tab , mr rivera of the puerto rico health care coalition said last year , oklahoma , which is wealthier than puerto rico , received 3 billion from the federal government , according to data compiled by the coalition mississippi , also not as poor as the island , received 36 billion a similar discrepancy exists with medicare and medicare advantage puerto rico s medicare reimbursement rates for doctors are 40 percent lower than the mainland s , and the medicare advantage program is paid 60 percent of the average rate in the states , according to coalition data dr johnny rull n , a health care expert who was once head of the island s health department , said puerto rico was not asking for more it was asking for equity we just need equal funding , he said that will take care of the problem
god had a busy week alabama alone was a heavy lift , what with all those god invocations by state leaders trying to cast out the demon of gay marriage , then london called as well scott walker was on a trip there , and he tugged god into the picture when he was asked about evolution and declined to answer , as if embracing it would be a heathen outrage in a subsequent tweet , walker insisted that there was n't any conflict between faith science , which , he wrote , go hand in hand that s debatable this is n't faith and government should n't be as cozy as they are in this country politicians in general , and republicans in particular , should n't genuflect as slavishly as they do , not in public they 're vying to be senators and presidents they 're not auditioning to be ministers and missionaries no one told that to rick perry as he ramped up for the 2012 presidential race and gave god a workout to be remembered i 've certainly never forgotten it he was then the governor of texas , and in april 2011 , as wildfires ravaged the state , he signed a gubernatorial proclamation denoting one 72hour period as the days of prayer for rain in the state of texas the following month , reflecting on the array of problems confronting america , he said , i think it s time for us to just hand it over to god , and say , god you 're going to have to fix this' and three months after that , he gathered some 30 , 000 people , most of them evangelical christians , in a houston stadium for an event called the response a call to prayer for a nation in crisis as manny fernandez of that rally in the times , perry used his office s prestige , letterhead , web site and other resources to promote it i do n't see much of a separation of church and state there remarkably , none of this was a drag on his aspirations for the oval office , not at all he remained a serious contender for his party s nomination until a debate performance that was less than celestial sent him tumbling to earth faith is a serious matter , and an important one , but it s trivialized when it s toted too readily and stridently into the political arena and while a creed can rightly be a personal compass , it s wrongly deployed as marching orders or a governing strategy politicians' religions and i use the plural on purpose , because there s no one religion that gets to trump the others should be a source of their strength and of their empathy , not of their agendas but that s not the way it works out in this country , especially not among republicans , who ca n't quit their fealty to the religious right and who , because of that , drive away many independent voters who are otherwise receptive to an ideology of limited government , personal responsibility and muscular foreign policy these voters just ca n't stomach all the moralizing that comes with that ideology they ca n't take the placement of divinity above darwin and there s a heavy dose of divinity mike huckabee , who is an ordained minister in the southern baptist church , put god in the title of a new book that he wrote and just released on the cusp of what may be another presidential bid he ran previously in 2008 , when he won the iowa caucuses the book is called god , guns , grits , and gravy these are a few of his favorite things during a on a christian tv program , he explained that he was mulling a 2016 campaign because america had lost sight of its identity as a godcentered nation that understands that our laws do not come from man , they come from god the way he talks , the constitution is a set of tablets hauled down from a mountaintop by a bearded prophet he later added that the only thing worse than not being elected president would be to be elected president without god s blessing i ca n't think of a worse place in the world to be than in the oval office without god s hand upon you last week he injected religion into politics in a different way , recalling president obama s recent reference to the crusades and questioning the president s respect for christianity huckabee said that muslims are the one group of people that can know they have his undying , unfailing support that s ugly and absurd while i agree that obama s digression into history was illtimed and unnecessary , i'm offended by huckabee s extrapolation huckabee is an extreme case within his party , but the republican courtship of the religious right and its fear of giving offense to christian fundamentalists are pervasive republican presidential candidates , even relatively moderate ones , of evolution as if it were a ticking bomb and they routinely polish their religious bona fides but we should be wary of politicians who are too eager to talk of religion , which is an easy rallying cry and , frequently , a diversion or even a disguise it can cover up private misdeeds it can put a rosy glow on political calculations obama , for example , framed his past opposition to gay marriage as a deeply personal matter of faith but as david axelrod s new book , believer , , it was a deeply expedient matter of evading some voters' wrath he more or less supported gay marriage , at least when he was away from the podium , all along we should be even warier of politicians and other leaders who wrap policy in dogma , claiming holy guidance that s a dangerous road to take at the far , bitter end of it lie theocracies and brutal extremists we should listen hard to what s being said in alabama , where opponents of gay marriage are n't merely asserting that it runs counter to what alabamians want they 're declaring that it perverts god s will , which was the position that some racists took about integration last week , the chairman of the alabama republican party wrote that the state would reap god s wrath if we embrace and condone things that are abhorrent to god , such as redefining marriage and in with the cnn anchor chris cuomo , alabama chief justice roy moore the man who once put up a granite monument to the ten commandments in the rotunda of the alabama judicial system building said , our rights , contained in the bill of rights , do not come from the constitution , they come from god that s your faith , cuomo replied but that s not our country cuomo s right , and god should be given a rest even in genesis he got one
many politicians seem intent on holding themselves as far back from us as possible , on parceling themselves out in only the smallest and most controlled bits even as they implore us to love them and insist that we trust them , they 're stingy cagey coiled not joe biden where others say too little , he says too much where others depend on extravagantly compensated swamis to contrive their authenticity and coax them toward it , biden needs help tamping down his irrepressible self how i 've loved watching him over his decades in public life how i 'd hate to see him enter the presidential race and punctuate those years with a final defeat biden , biden , biden the drumbeat swells , coming from all directions , even from dick cheney he recently did an interview with cnn , the first snippets of which were shown on monday , and offered biden the following counsel about 2016 go for it this is probably the most compelling evidence that biden should n't when cheney itches for an intervention , beware biden s own moves , including a scheduled appearance next thursday on the late show with stephen colbert , further stoke speculation and hopes but while many democrats have enormous respect for him and he s done plenty to deserve it , this is n't really about him it s about hillary clinton her presumptuousness , the whole email mess , the sloppy administration of the clinton foundation , the sense that scandals are as inextricable from her political identity as pantsuits some democratic leaders and operatives would desperately like an alternative an alternative , that is , with better generalelection prospects than a 73yearold socialist with little support from minorities martin o'malley has n't come through he might as well be an apparition for all the impact he s made someone else is needed cue the biden talk we journalists eagerly amplify it , because nothing improves a narrative like the addition of an especially colorful character we disingenuously pretend that his favorability ratings and other flattering poll results have the same meaning as corresponding numbers for clinton and bernie sanders they do n't , because he s a hypothetical candidate and they 're actual ones , and it s the difference between a courtship in its dawn and a marriage in its dusk once someone has really moved into the house and is leaving dirty dishes in the sink , the electricity dims and everything droops even while drooping , clinton holds onto a great deal of support , and she stands on the very territory that biden , to get the nomination , would need he s neither to the left of her , where the energy of the party is , nor is he newer than her , one democratic strategist said he personifies neither progressivity nor change and you need to have one of the two preferably , both to win clinton s familiarity is mitigated by the possibility that she 'd make history the first woman in the white house biden has nothing like that going for him he s a profoundly awkward fit for this strange political moment , this season of outsiders and insurgents voters are sour on career politicians , and biden s career in politics spans about 45 uninterrupted years voters are antiwashington in particular , and more than 42 of those years have been spent in the national s capital , as a senator from delaware and then as the vice president aspects of his legislative record are more troubling for him now than ever before as nicholas fandos noted in a in the times , biden pushed for , and later crowed about , toughoncrime legislation in the 1980s and 1990s that preceded the mass incarceration of today that would be a wedge between him and the democratic party s black voters especially and as steve eder noted in another in the times , biden was , of necessity , an ambassador for the financial services industry in delaware that hardly positions him to win the favor of liberal democrats who yearn for a crackdown on wall street biden has twice before pursued the democratic nomination and never won a single state the last time , in 2008 , he got less than 1 percent of the vote in the iowa caucuses and then quickly dropped out and while much about circumstances and about biden has changed since then , what has n't , at least not significantly , is the uncorked , uncensored quality that contributed to his troubles before he he with his hands he talks and talks , in sentences that sometimes go too far , with words that have n't been weighed as carefully as they could be the route from his brain to his lips is direct and swift none of the usual traffic cones there sometimes this is enervating mostly it s endearing for better or worse , it s not the means to a promotion , not for this remarkable man at this remarkable time
the state is ending its payments to , gov asa hutchinson said friday , despite warnings federal officials have given other states that such a move could violate the law mr hutchinson , a republican , ordered the department of human services to terminate its medicaid contract in 30 days he did so in response to secretly recorded videos released by an anti group showing planned parenthood officials describing how they provide fetal tissue from abortions for medical research planned parenthood received more than 51 , 000 from medicaid in arkansas in the past fiscal year for family planning and gynecological services none of the money went toward abortions , the human services department said alabama and louisiana previously said they would end payments , prompting a warning from the federal department of health and human services that it could violate federal law
nashville in her acceptance speech on thursday , mayorelect megan barry , a candidate characterized as a purveyor of extreme leftist views in a bruising runoff here , mentioned the various residents who would write the next chapter for this fastgrowing southern city in a notably nonextreme move , she spoke first of the city s business community they need a mayor who will help recruit and retain the talent so that nashville can energize and reach our full potential , she said it is telling , in 21stcentury nashville , that many here find ms barry s liberal reputation and probusiness rhetoric to be complementary rather than contradictory ms barry , 51 , earned that reputation during eight years on the metropolitan council , where she was an outspoken advocate for abortion rights , and a minimumwage increase it was a reputation she did not retreat from over the past week as she handily defeated her decidedly more conservative rival , david fox , 54 , a former hedgefund manager ms barry s victory she will be first female mayor of this city , chartered in 1806 was made possible , in part , by the support of a significant segment of nashville s business class it is a dynamic now common in many heartland and southern states , where urban centers are often blue havens in vast seas of republican red in many cities , large businesses have lent their support to socially liberal policies , on the theory that they might fight outsiders' perceptions of entrenched intolerance and make it easier to do the recruiting and retention that ms barry mentioned , particularly of young , techsavvy employees it is a strategy that can build its own political momentum , attracting newcomers who can push a city s politics further left in a way , ms barry , a california native raised in the midwest , is a product of that momentum , and of a new nashville energized by , and sometimes polarized by , the flood of new residents ms barry moved to nashville to pursue a master s degree in business administration from vanderbilt university in 1991 that same year , nashville elected phil bredesen , the future tennessee governor he was the first in a string of three now four mayors , none born in tennessee , who set a socially liberal , probusiness tone that has come to define the city s politics ms barry earned her degree she also fell in love with nashville and with her future husband , bruce barry , a vanderbilt management professor and member of the american civil liberties union s state board who shared her liberal social views she found work at nortel , the telecommunications company , where she developed and managed ethics programs , before working as an ethics and compliance officer for premier inc , a health care firm both companies are the types of businesses that are less flashy than nashville s music industry but provide many of its whitecollar jobs the social issues for me have always been about people , ms barry said in an interview friday business plays a huge role in impacting people s lives so for me the marrying of the progressive and the business has always been the way forward it was the morning after the election , and ms barry was working her way through bongo java , a popular coffee shop a few blocks from her comfortable brick bungalow in belmont hillsboro village the hip , historic neighborhood and the cafe itself it offers a mango coriander mocha could have easily fit into the gentrified urban grid of austin , tex , portland , ore , or atlanta before she could sit down , ms barry was spotted by stephanie silverman , the executive director of the belcourt theater , a historic , nonprofit arthouse cinema that ms barry helped reopen after it fell on hard times hi , how are you , darling \? the mayorelect said , giving ms silverman a squeeze ms barry and her husband have long moved at the center of their neighborhood s engaged and somewhat bohemian microculture ms silverman , 45 , said that they were known for their famous barry home events , which she described as just huge gatherings of very diverse people in nashville the couple are artfilm buffs ms barry expressed a preference for truffaut over godard in that great litmus test for cineastes \( but sometimes i just like a good romcom , she added \) as a kind of hobby , ms silverman said , the couple have hosted numerous cold warthemed films at the belcourt , recently refurbished as a jewel of the new nashville ms barry raised her son , max , now in college , in the neighborhood after serving on the local pta and the neighborhood association , she was elected , in 2007 , to an atlarge seat on nashville s 40member citycounty metro council she quickly established herself as one its most liberal members she was a vocal opponent of an unsuccessful englishlanguageonly ballot measure in 2009 , which was also opposed by a large swath of the business community that same year , she sponsored and won approval of an ordinance against lgbt discrimination in 2010 , she delivered a crucial vote supporting mayor karl dean s vision for a 586 million convention hall , the music city center , even though her husband publicly opposed the plan , writing critically of it on the website of the nashville scene , an alternative weekly newspaper the convention center has been a success thus far , helping to jumpstart downtown s oncemoribund tourist zone in april , the national rifle association held its annual convention at the center , attracting more than 70 , 000 attendees approving the building , ms barry said , meant that we were going to bet on nashville \( ms barry has , over the years , also supported what the scene a slew of economic incentives deals backed by mayor dean that gave tax breaks to big corporations \) mr dean is leaving office because of term limits after an eightyear run critics of ms barry , who will be sworn in on sept 25 , have noted that some of her crusades have not amounted to much mr fox said a muchpromoted living wage law for government workers , which she supported , had ended up giving raises only to some 14 workers mr fox also criticized the council , including ms barry , over its financial management he noted that moody s downgraded the city s bond rating in march 2014 , citing an aboveaverage debt burden but moody s , in announcing the downgrade , also noted the city s stable financial position , and ms barry dismissed mr fox s criticism as overblown during the campaign similar issues could arise as ms barry pursues two of her campaign promises instituting universal prekindergarten and testing whether the city s bus system can be offered free of charge \( ms barry said friday that she would seek federal funding for both projects \) mr fox s most controversial criticism came as he argued that ms barry was too liberal for nashville one of his ads alleged that ms barry and her husband opposed the national day of prayer , a claim ms barry denied it was an argument that was bound to attract some voters in a southern city where , on friday , a coffee shop patron could be overheard discussing her prayer group with a friend , and where a pickup roaring through town sported a sticker declaring , if you do n't put god back in america , there wo n't be an america but in the end , the criticisms were not enough
chicago demonstrators took to the streets of this city s downtown in tense but largely peaceful protests after the release of video on tuesday showing the fatal shooting of a black teenager by a white chicago police officer into the early morning hours of wednesday , protesters led clusters of police officers on a march through the streets of chicago s loop , blocking intersections , chanting outside a police station and , along a major road to the city s largest highways , unfurling a banner that cited deaths at the hands of the police the night of protest followed a day of fastmoving events firstdegree murder charges against the officer , jason van dyke , in the shooting of laquan mcdonald , 17 , and , hours later , the release of graphic video from a police dashboard camera of the 2014 shooting , which a judge had ordered the city to make public by wednesday in a period that has seen sometimes violent unrest over police conduct in places like ferguson , mo , and baltimore , some in chicago seemed relieved by the relative calm while on the whole last night s demonstrations were peaceful , a few isolated incidents resulted in five arrests related to resisting arrest and assaulting police officers , a police spokesman said on wednesday still , some community leaders have called for more demonstrations here , including a boycott and protest on friday , the postthanksgiving shopping day , of this city s famed shopping district along north michigan avenue known as the magnificent mile the grainy , nighttime dashboard camera video , which a judge ordered released last week , shows the young man running and then walking past officers in the middle of the street and spinning when bullets suddenly strike him down for a moment , lying on the ground , he moves but then is still after he appears to be shot several more times an officer kicks an object away from his body the video shows none of the officers on the scene offering mr mcdonald assistance standing with community leaders before releasing the video , mayor and garry mccarthy , the chicago police superintendent , said they expected demonstrations in response to the graphic nature of the video , and urged people to avoid violence it s fine to be passionate , but it is essential that it remain peaceful , mr emanuel said officer van dyke , 37 , who has been with the police department for 14 years , is the first chicago police officer in decades to be charged with murder in an onduty shooting the city previously fought to keep the video private , citing a continuing investigation into the shooting officer van dyke was charged and the video released just over a year after mr mcdonald was shot 16 times , even after he had stepped slightly away from the officer , prosecutors said witnesses said mr mcdonald , who was carrying a threeinch folding knife , never spoke to officer van dyke or any of the other officers and did not make threatening moves toward him none of at least seven other police officers on the scene fired their weapons the naacp , on twitter , called it unacceptable that it took over a year for the video to be released the family of mr mcdonald , which had opposed the video s release , issued a statement through its lawyers calling for calm no one understands the anger more than us , but if you choose to speak out , we urge you to be peaceful , the family said do n't resort to violence in laquan s name let his legacy be better than that in announcing the murder charge , anita alvarez , the cook county state s attorney , acknowledged that she had pushed to charge the officer before the video became public i made a decision to come forward first because i felt like , with the release of this video , that it s really important for public safety that the citizens of chicago know that this officer is being held accountable for his actions , ms alvarez said since late last year , the shooting has been investigated by a team that included the fbi , the united states attorney s office in chicago and the cook county state s attorney s office but ms alvarez said she decided to proceed with charges on her own when the videotape was ordered released federal charges are still possible , legal experts said , and the federal authorities said their investigation was continuing ms alvarez , a twoterm democrat who is seeking reelection in march , defended herself against suggestions that the investigation had taken too long , saying investigations into police shootings often take more than a year and she rejected claims that she had buckled to political pressure by filing the charges before the video came out , saying she had reached a conclusion several weeks ago that charges were warranted hours before the video s release , a judge , donald panarese jr , ordered officer van dyke held without bail , indicating that he wanted to see the video before revisiting the question of bond at a hearing on monday officer van dyke faces 20 years to life in prison if convicted dan herbert , a lawyer for officer van dyke , has said the officer believed the shooting was justified because he feared for his safety and that of other officers mr herbert said his client absolutely intended to go to trial dressed in a beige sweater and jeans , mr van dyke said little during the brief hearing the charges and the release of the video came amid a national debate over race , police shootings and a growing number of violent encounters with the police captured on video chicago s police force has its own sometimes painful history , which by some estimates includes more than 500 million in settlements and other costs over the last decade tied to police misconduct as well as reparations for black residents who said a group of officers abused and tortured them in the 1970s and '80s in april , the city even before a suit had been filed in the case on the evening of oct 20 , 2014 , police officers approached mr mcdonald on the city s southwest side , prosecutors said , after a resident reported seeing him breaking into trucks and stealing radios mr mcdonald , who had the folding knife in his hand , walked away as officers arrived someone called for a police unit with a , though it was not clear whether anyone ever appeared with one at one point , mr mcdonald popped the tire on a police car , apparently with his knife , the prosecutors said with more officers arriving car by car , mr mcdonald kept walking and jogging along , not responding to orders to drop the knife , prosecutors said near a burger king along a busy stretch of pulaski road , officer van dyke s marked chevrolet tahoe pulled up alongside other police vehicles , including one containing a dashboard camera officer van dyke was on the scene for fewer than 30 seconds , prosecutors said , before he began shooting his service weapon , which had a 16round capacity the shooting spanned 14 or 15 seconds , and in about 13 of those seconds , prosecutors say , mr mcdonald was lying on the ground he was hit 16 times , including in his backside an autopsy showed the presence of the drug pcp in his system for months , the city had refused to release the video on thursday , franklin valderrama , a cook county judge , ordered it released the city initially indicated that it would appeal , but mr then announced that chicago would release the video , and he issued a statement condemning officer van dyke s actions and calling for prosecutors to take prompt action in accordance with the judge s ruling , the city will release the video by nov 25 , which we hope will provide prosecutors time to expeditiously bring their investigation to a conclusion so chicago can begin to heal , mr emanuel said last week on monday , he met privately with community leaders and pastors officer van dyke has worked as a chicago police officer since june 2001 , records show he had been on administrative duty pending the investigation , and on tuesday was placed on nopay status because of the criminal charge , mr mccarthy said mr herbert , the officer s lawyer , said officer van dyke was highly decorated with an excellent record and numerous awards but records show that the officer had been the subject of numerous complaints from residents , including allegations of using excessive force and making racial slurs mr herbert said that no merit had ever been found by the authorities in any of the allegations against officer van dyke the chicago police are frequently involved in shootings , including but officers here rarely face charges for firing their weapons dante servin , a detective , is perhaps the most notable exception in recent memory in a 2012 offduty shooting that resulted in the death of rekia boyd , an unarmed black woman  officials said mr mcdonald was a ward of the state at the time of his death , and was attending an alternative school , sullivan house high school he was coming every day , joking and even giving hugs , thomas gattuso , the principal , said in an interview michael d robbins , a lawyer for mr mcdonald s family , said he had been raised , in large part , by a grandmother , who died in 2013 his mother had been working to regain custody before his death , mr robbins said his mother has not been able to bring herself to watch the video , he said she is very , very distraught , mr robbins said monday evening it s a reminder about the loss of her son and it s going to come as this big , glaring , publicly displayed event she is very emotional
two months before she died of in november 2010 , my normally strong , stoical mother broke down weeping in my arms over the fate of my older brother institutionalized for over 40 years , joshua , then 55 , was in a stable situation and seemed relatively happy but my mother was undone by that fear that haunts all parents of disabled children though i hastened to assure her that i would become his guardian and watch over him after her death , she was inconsolable in reality , given the nature of the bond between them , i should n't have been surprised as is often the case between mother and disabled child , the two early on formed a deep , exclusionary attachment that relegated the other members of our family to the outer boroughs of maternal attention my brother s marathon tantrums , his gory public \( and private \) displays of selfmutilation and his regular physical assaults on our mother left me balancing as a boy on a narrow emotional catwalk between instinctual love for my sibling and blind rage but none of that altered the depth of her feeling for him in the least he was her main passion in life , and would remain so till the very end after her death , as promised , i signed the guardianship papers and found myself suddenly a parttime resident in the island nation of adult autism in america what i did n't realize at the time was just how uncharted the waters around that island would turn out to be i knew plenty about childhood autism , of course who does n't \? a malady sometimes described as a form of perceptual overload seems somehow a fitting response to today s speeding , signalclotted life and the numbers are dizzying from a reported incidence of one child in 150 with autism in the year 2000 , the prevalence has now risen to one in 68 meanwhile , a vast autism infrastructure has grown up around these numbers , with an array of new schools , websites , activist organizations , support and advocacy social networks , and eloquent voices at the very highest cultural and political levels of our society speaking of the rights of those with autism researchers are currently backdating the history of autism by reclaiming previously mysterious events the holy fools of russia , the socalled feral children of early modern europe as potentially having autism at their root and the recent lumping of the asperger s syndrome diagnosis and a variety of related childhood disorders under the rubric of autism spectrum disorder , or asd , has produced sufferers of autism so highfunctioning they often regard their autism as a gift or visionary complement to life this aggregate big tent approach to autism also partly explains the rise in the sheer numbers of children given that diagnosis but children eventually grow up and children with autism have been growing up for over 50 years roughly 500 , 000 children with autism will become adults over the next 10 years , and as they step through the door of age 21 , they 'll find themselves inheritors of a sad paradox the variety of federally mandated supports and services \( under the aegis of the department of education \) available to them until then will have expired the source of their funding will switch to the far smaller pie of statebystate money these resources , along with and , are more fragmented and difficult for families to navigate so the financial support used to train them for jobs , find housing , obtain therapy and counseling will dwindle at the exact moment in time they need it most a 2011 study found that 39 percent of young people with autism in the united states received no services whatsoever after high school loneliness and social isolation are major issues unemployment among adults with autism most of them higher functioning than my brother is common an estimated 90 percent of adults with autism are unemployed or underemployed state funding , it seems , remains keyed to the idea that the same maturational curve applies both to neurotypicals and those with disabilities , and apparently relies on a magicalthinking belief that these young adults will somehow smoothly make the transition into adulthood without special guidance some states now get matching federal funds , but the steep dropoff and the steep challenge for parents and children remains it s part of a larger disconnect there is virtually no current substantive national discussion on the fate of middleaged or elderly autistic people like my brother , who are living in therapeutic communities , or with their aged parents or in group homes , or sometimes undiagnosed in mental hospitals little research money is spent on members of this demographic , and there is almost no public policy debate on how best to serve them not much is known of the particular health problems linked to their longterm care , or how their autism progresses and changes over time , or what the cumulative effects might be of the medication they take to render them tractable enough to live in social settings as dr joseph piven , a professor of psychiatry , pediatrics and psychology at the university of north carolina at chapel hill , has put it , there is almost no literature on older adults with autism in the field , so we have virtually no knowledge base joshua is fortunate as the beneficiary of decades of the hardworking advocacy of my mother , he now resides in the social and medical equivalent of a perfect fit a beautiful , wellstaffed therapeutic community in central new jersey retired from active daily work after a long career of doing things like busing tables at mcdonald s \( too difficult \) serving in a high school cafeteria \( same \) and working on the lawn crew of the large farmstead a rural therapeutic community where he spent many years \( a job loathed but tackled with a certain grim tenacity \) , he was moved at age 57 from the main campus to another a few miles away , designed specifically for older residents but even this place grapples with the stark realities i regularly receive terse calls from my brother announcing the departure of a care worker he 'd grown attached to why \? because therapeutic communities and congregate settings for adults with autism suffer from a job turnover in direct care staff so high it can only be labeled a hemorrhage direct care workers , whom i 've observed up close for 30 years , are the true unsung heroes of the universe , providing the stability and warmth of family when family is gone or far away but poor pay \( a 2009 study found the national average for an entrylevel fulltime direct care staffer to be less than 22 , 000 a year \) virtually guarantees high turnover in terms of overall expenditure , government support for people with autism is considerable the combating autism act was passed under president george w bush in 2006 and authorized generous outlays for screening , early intervention , education and research it was renewed in 2014 \( its name was changed to the more palatable autism cares act \) under president obama , and continues the disbursal of a large amount of money about a quarter of a billion dollars a year to a variety of federal , state and private initiatives but a quick glance at the funding priorities shows little devoted to people my brother s age while more funds would help , it s not enough to throw money at adult autism what s needed instead is an intelligent , directed deployment of resources and a larger seat at the table of policy debate at both state and federal levels karen parenti , the vice president of community solutions for bancroft , a large provider of services for individuals with developmental disabilities and brain injuries , which owns and oversees my brother s residence , noted an urgent need for things like longitudinal studies on the longterm effects of medications used in autism care and financial support for lifelong learning programs and public education to louis f reichardt , the director of the simons foundation autism research initiative , distinguishing the needs of adults with autism from those of the younger population is paramount we need to identify what features these adults share or do not share with the preadult population , such as iq , verbal ability and social skills this might tell us to what extent maturity and aging influence the severity of the deficits associated with autism , he wrote in an email in truth , what s simply needed is more of everything and in the last several years there have , in fact , been a smattering of research initiatives into older adult autism much more is needed but none of it will arrive in time to have an impact on the life of my brother on a recent visit to joshua at his facility , the drill was the same as ever my girlfriend and i greeted the affable staffers , and then took him out for a meal , where he defaulted to the same cycling , anxietyfueled series of questions he does every time we 're together i 've come a long way , have n't i \? or are you happy i'm doing as well as i am while seeing you \? or , repeatedly , what time do i have to return home tomorrow \? we saw a movie in blessed conversational silence , stayed overnight in a hotel with him , in that way fulfilling his dream of getting off campus for at least a night , and the next day bid him a heartfelt goodbye when i was younger , these visits would shatter me , and i 'd often drive home in tears but such extremities of feeling are long behind me i'm soothed by the thought that he seems reconciled with his destiny it s reassuring to know that my brother will continue to live out his life as he has for the last many years , his mind stabilized by powerful medications , his thoughts revolving around his next activity and meal , the legacy of my mother s work visible in his neat , sunny room and sparkling surroundings is ignorance a blessing \? in certain circumstances , yes among the many things he 'll be unaware of , blessedly , is just how lucky he is
chicago the are built in the image of the , by the same architectural firm that turned another hardluck franchise into a champion only through extreme hardship did theo epstein s red sox win their elusive title for the cubs to do it now , they must follow the same path after on tuesday , the cubs trail the in the national league championship series by three games to none the same hole the red sox fell into against the yankees in the fabled american league championship series of 2004 no other baseball team has won a bestofseven series after losing the first three games there s confidence in this clubhouse that s never going to go away , the cubs' anthony rizzo said we 've just got to keep playing baseball one new york team has blown a 30 lead let s make it the other new york team that s the way we 're going to look at it that s the only thing we can do we have to be optimistic epstein , who drafted rizzo while with the red sox in 2007 , had sounded that note at wrigley field on monday , a workout day he predicted a better game than the one his team went on to play tuesday we 've always responded , all year long , with a long winning streak after a stretch of poor play , epstein , the cubs' president of baseball operations , had said i 'd be shocked if this is how we 're going out , with play that s not representative of the talent and character we have in the clubhouse i think we 'll show a lot better in the course of this series yet the cubs' first two losses , both at citi field , were not marked by ineptitude or misfortune the mets simply pitched better than the cubs and got their daily dose of daniel murphy heroics the same factors helped the mets on tuesday but this time , the cubs helped , too with two outs in the sixth inning and the score tied at 22 , cubs reliever trevor cahill struck out michael conforto that should have been a very good thing , a clutch out by a reliever pitching for his fourth organization this season but these are the cubs so naturally , the strikeout took the mets to the verge of their first world series berth in 15 years and the cubs to the brink of being eliminated from contention for the pennant for a 70th season in a row on the previous pitch , catcher miguel montero had saved a run by blocking a ball in the dirt but he could not do it again , and cahill s curveball skipped between his legs yoenis cespedes , who had stolen third when cahill failed to hold him close , scampered home , and the mets had a lead they would not give back it was a tough one , montero said i went down to block it , and unfortunately , i did n't it really hurts i 've blocked pitches like that many , many times i did n't block that one it really hurt because it was strike three you know what \? it happens it s part of the game we ca n't block every ball i wish we could even the famous ivy at wrigley field could not save the cubs , no matter how much it tried when wilmer flores followed conforto by slashing a sinking liner to right , jorge soler dived for it in vain the ball hopped to the wall , where it disappeared into a thicket the ground rule kept conforto at third and cost the mets a run when jacob degrom flied out to end the inning but the mets got the run back when more cubs things happened with one out and david wright on second , murphy beat out an infield single on a spinning squibber to third then kyle schwarber , a cubs slugger with five home runs this postseason , did a greg luzinski turn in left field in the seventh a catchable cespedes fly ball became a generously scored runscoring single i just misread it , schwarber said no excuses i just did n't get a good read that s it lucas duda then bounced to first , and rizzo stepped on the bag before firing to the plate , wide and just late , as murphy slid into home rizzo s momentum had taken him to the base anyway , but perhaps the extra step cost him just enough on the throw the cubs have repeated a mantra they got from their manager , joe maddon , who likes to remind his team never to let the pressure exceed the pleasure those words have sunken in by now , and maddon said he would not address the players before  i do n't have team meetings , he said i do n't believe in them for me to stand up and give a speech has nothing to do with tomorrow at all our guys know how to come prepared to play i expect the same thing tomorrow the mets have just pitched exceptionally well , and you 've got to give them credit in these three games so from my perspective , business as usual that includes his choice of starting pitcher maddon will use jason hammel and deploy his deep platoon of relievers without hesitation he will not bring back jon lester on short rest a lot of times , pitchers do n't do that well on three days' rest , so why even take that risk right now when you know you 've got to win more than just one game \? maddon said if it was oneanddone , you may do something like that , but it s got to be fouranddone while the 2004 red sox are the only encouraging example to cite for a team facing this sort of hole , boston s 2007 championship team compares more closely to this version of the cubs that team was not burdened by decades of failure , as the red sox were in 2004 , but it did face a threegamestoone deficit in the american league championship series against cleveland before rallying to win it all the core of dustin pedroia , jacoby ellsbury and lester stayed together long enough to win another title six years later with rizzo , schwarber , kris bryant , starlin castro and addison russell , the cubs have stockpiled young hitters with years of contractual control schwarber was just drafted in 2014 , and some of the scouts and coaches were at wrigley for his mammoth home run against the cardinals in the last round they got to tell all the kids in instructional league , hey , someone who was sitting here a year ago is on national tv hitting bombs , ' epstein said we saw that in boston when ellsbury and pedroia had a great world series it ties the whole organization together a cubs way starts to take hold we 're a united , talented , gutsy organization unity , talent and guts helped carry the cubs to this stage they will need all of that , and some of the old boston magic , to keep this new york team from dancing on wrigley field on wednesday night
paul matuska is the closest thing the american west has to a water cop , and his beat includes needles , calif , a beleaguered desert town midway between flagstaff , ariz , and los angeles about 4 , 800 people live in needles , on the western bank of the colorado river where it cuts a swath in the mud between california and arizona the old railroad town is the gateway to the farmland of the fort mojave indian reservation across the river mr matuska , a hydrologist , is one of about a dozen accountants for the federal bureau of reclamation , which controls water distribution along the lower half of the colorado river his job is to count the water used by cities like needles and the farms around them lands close to the essential colorado and make sure they do n't take more than their share of the river as it happens , needles gets most of its water from underground pumping an average of about 700 million gallons a year from four wells it has drilled into the local aquifer in recent years , such withdrawals have taken on more importance in the west , particularly in california and arizona , as streams shrivel , rivers are fought over and reservoirs run dry about 60 percent of california s water now comes from underground , according to estimates by nasa researchers arizona , staring down imminent rationing of colorado river water , pumps nearly half its supplies from aquifers but in allowing their residents to tap underground resources this way , regulators and legislators in those states have ignored a basic truth about how much water is actually available in many places , groundwater in aquifers and surface water in rivers and reservoirs are not separate supplies but interconnected parts of the same system what this means is that there is even less water than people think in a region already afflicted by a prolonged drought that has led to water rationing and fears for the future how much less , and exactly where the overlaps exist , are not fully known but the needles example suggests that the overlap could be enormous mr matuska knows that the water drawn up from the wells in needles comes from the colorado river , fed by snowpack in the rocky mountains technically , that water has already been allocated , with strict budgets allowed for each of the states along the river under a compact among the states and so to avoid overcounting the valley s resources , mr matuska subtracts the groundwater needles uses from the total amount that california is allowed to pump from the colorado river into its canals and ship to los angeles and elsewhere each year the reason mr matuska is counting water supplies so carefully in needles is because the town falls within the slender slice of countryside that immediately adjoins the colorado the federal government has the authority over the water there , and it enforces what has long been accepted as scientific fact and prudent strategy surface water and groundwater are one how can this be \? if you were to slice a knife through the earth and look at the cut , a cross section would generally show bands of solid rock bent over like a bell or bent up like a bowl when it rains , water soaks into the earth , through soil and rock , saturating porous areas and running over the buried topography until it is blocked by an impermeable surface there , the water can sit , trapped beneath the bell or pooling in the bowl needles sits above one of those shallow bowls , a subterranean valley packed with porous gravel that is easily filled with water and so a funny thing happens when needles pumps its water from underground no matter how much the city uses , the water level in the local groundwater wells never drops instead , water is sucked out of the colorado river bed , underground , toward the wells , filling any subterranean void because the earth is especially porous along the colorado , the water essentially spills out the river s bottom , unseen , filling a geologic bathtub beneath needles and its nearby terrain , and refilling the aquifer there are lots of ways water in the west is being mismanaged farming subsidies for waterintensive crops arcane laws encouraging waste leaky infrastructure but none may be more significant than refusing to accept the fact that the west s water resources are interconnected willingly overlooking that fact amounts to a fundamental failure of water management that has left states more vulnerable to drought and less prepared to adapt to the effects of climate change moreover , it has left them blind to an honest accounting of their total supply how can anyone plan for the future if there is n't agreement about something as basic as how much water there actually is \? in much of california and arizona two of the states with arguably the most severe water crises and water management challenges in the nation state and local authorities continue to count the sources of water as if they were entirely separate , two distinct bank accounts states have their own take on this or they choose to not address it at all , said stanley a leake , a hydrologist with the united states geological survey who is a leading expert on properly accounting for the connection between ground and surface waters in the west in some cases they pretend that there is no connection leaders in california and arizona acknowledge that their states have failed to adequately account for overlapping supplies of surface water and groundwater and it s not hard to appreciate why doing the water math properly would mean facing the fact that there is even less water available than residents have been led to believe acting on that grim jolt of reality would mean changing laws governing traditional water rights or forcing farmers and cities to accept even more dramatic cuts than they already face in california , the state s water agency has said that the failure to account for how groundwater withdrawals affect the state s rivers is a major impediment to a true accounting of its resources in april , authorities reported that less than half of the state s local water agencies had complied with a 2002 law that made them eligible for state funds only if they set up groundwater management plans and determined if a connection between surface water and groundwater existed that connection does not exist uniformly and varies depending on local geology only 17 percent of the state s groundwater basins had been examined indeed , california still does n't require that water pumped from underground be measured at all , much less factored into an overall assessment of total water resources it s merely an option under a new law signed last september california s new groundwater legislation does require local water authorities to come up with sustainable groundwater plans , but they do n't have to do that until 2020 , and they do n't have to balance their water withdrawals until 2040 so fierce was the pushback by the agriculture industry against any regulation of underground water that the new law , somewhat perversely , explicitly barred any attempt by the state to count the groundwater withdrawals as coming from one overall water supply until local agencies had at least 10 more years to come up with and implement their plans those who have unlimited water supply do n't particularly like the idea of changing that , said fran pavley , a democrat and the california state senator who drafted two of the three bills that became the groundwater law you ca n't manage what you do n't measure arizona is in a slightly different situation , because the state does measure its groundwater supply , and often restricts how much water can be pumped from it still , arizona is in dire straits its colorado river water deliveries could be curtailed starting next year by the bureau of reclamation , which dispenses the river s water from lake mead earlier this month , the lake dropped to its lowest point since it was created by the construction of the hoover dam and calculations based on arizona s own water accounting suggest that demand could outpace its existing water supply in less than a decade but its laws still do n't require an accurate joining of its surface water and groundwater supplies if the connection between groundwater and surface water is considered , that time frame for running out of water altogether will almost certainly be even shorter arizona s top water official told propublica that it was both politically difficult and costly to properly account for the interconnection but deep in a 685page document that is part of arizona s water plan , the state lists 42 groundwater basins that it says are connected to surface water , indicating a potential conflict over rights to those supplies it s unclear how much water flows from one into the other , but the documents show that many of the water sources are heavily relied on as sources of both groundwater and surface supplies at the same time thomas buschatzke , the director of arizona s department of water resources , acknowledged that pumping from wells could dry up streams , but said the current law kept the two resources separate , and it would be a huge upset to the economy to do away with that but john bredehoeft , a leading hydrogeologist and former director of the federal government s western states water program , bluntly emphasized the importance of basic honesty in counting water if you do n't connect the two , then you do n't understand the system , he said and if you do n't understand the system , i do n't know how in the hell you 're going to make any kind of judgment about how much water you 've got to work with until state officials do , it seems unlikely that there will be any real solution to managing the southwest s strained water resources for the future
atlanta with just over 10 seconds remaining on the game clock , deron williams had an opportunity to salvage yet another untidy individual performance , to silence for just a moment all the talk that his game has become too passive were down by 2 points to the atlanta hawks , who elected to chase williams off the 3point line when the ball reached him in the left corner so williams eluded a closing defender with a fake , took a quick lefthanded dribble to the baseline and rose up from 16 feet away , all alone , to shoot the sellout crowd at philips arena collectively exhaled as the ball skipped off the front of the rim , clanged off the back of it and caromed toward the floor the nets slunk off the court soon thereafter the nets have a tough road ahead after falling , 9691 , to the hawks at philips arena and into a 20 hole in their firstround series the nets will have two days of practice to right their wrongs before game 3 on saturday afternoon at barclays center i'm sure tonight i 'll think about it a lot not just the shot , just the game in general , said williams , who scored just 2 points , while shooting 1 for 7 from the field , to go with 10 rebounds and 8 assists i had a lot of chances , felt like i could have played better but we 've got two more at home now that we 've got to go get the hawks and their fans had spent two days this week fretting about paul millsap s aching right shoulder and al horford s sore right pinkie finger but in a rough and ragged game , the hobbled allstars came through millsap finished with a teamhigh 19 points , and horford had 14 points and 13 rebounds they 're winnable games for us , if we set the tone early and come out and do what we 're supposed to do , millsap said of the coming games as the teams arrived for game 2 , multiple outlets were reporting that the billionaire antony ressler and a group of investors had reached an agreement to buy the hawks and the arena the organization officially announced the sale , which needs to be approved by the nba board of governors , during the first half coach mike budenholzer stressed before the game that it would not be a distraction to his team jarrett jack led the nets with 23 points he scored 16 in the first half , helping the nets erase a 12point deficit in the first quarter there were six lead changes before the end of the third quarter , which ended with the hawks up , 7567 there were none in the fourth the nets received a lift midway through the first quarter when mirza teletovic entered as the first substitute off the bench teletovic had last played on jan 22 that night , he pulled himself out of a game while feeling short of breath it was later found that he had bilateral pulmonary embolus , a formation of blood clots in the lungs , and the team said that he would miss the rest of the year in march , teletovic said he hoped to return to fullspeed in july he played 3 minutes 50 seconds and missed two fieldgoal attempts
beijing when the composer wang xilin s haunting requiem for the souls of china s millions of dead rings out in beijing on sunday , half a century will have passed since he first conceived of it yet the work , symphony no 9 requiem for the war of chinese people s resistance against japanese aggression and the world s antifascist war , will take to the stage just once performed by the china national symphony orchestra and its choir , and the choir of capital normal university , at the national center for the performing arts , soloists will include the baritone sun yu and the german soprano brigitte wohlfarth asked why it was getting just one performance after so many years , mr wang a forthright 78yearold with thick , graying hair and a shrewd gaze as one of the most significant composers in china , distinct for his expressive and dramatic musical language and his subversive politics shrugged you ask them , he said , referring to the cultural bureaucrats who decide what can be performed i wanted to write this 20 years ago , mr wang said even earlier in 1964 , when i was first persecuted the war was very cruel , and it was the greatest tragedy of the chinese people , he added there were so many dead in an interview in his apartment near the orchestra headquarters , mr wang explained why he wanted to write a requiem about a war that ended 70 years ago mr wang , the son of a nationalist official who grew up in the provinces of gansu and shaanxi and was a child during the war , said he never saw japanese in his home but we used to hear scary things like , that they would stick dead children s heads on sticks but he also discussed personal tragedies , prompted by experiences of political persecution by the communists , who defeated the nationalists in china s civil war , which ended in 1949 and sometimes , the two seem to blend 1964 , when he says he first considered writing the piece , was the year that mr wang , a new graduate of the shanghai conservatory of music , publicly criticized the communist party s cultural policies disaster struck he was sent into forced labor for about a decade in shanxi province , where he says he was beaten until he lost several teeth and much of his hearing , an affliction to this day his brother starved to death in the famine precipitated by the great leap forward \( 195861 \) , when agriculture was collectivized his sister lost her mind in a labor camp , he said none of that dimmed his passion for his people and what he says was their lowest moment the japanese invasion and war scholars estimate that 10 million to 30 million chinese died from 1937 to 1945 the tragedy was far broader than most chinese realize and despite many official accounts is still poorly understood , mr wang said people do n't know anything about this today because the communist party drove the kuomintang out , he said , referring to chiang kaishek s nationalists after the communist victory , much of the history of kuomintang rule was ignored , he said major battles led by the kuomintang were ignored after 1949 , he said chongqing , the nationalist wartime capital , was heavily bombed with many casualties , but this is not emphasized in partyapproved history , he said there were legs in trees , he said caves dug into mountainsides for shelter collapsed , killing many we only know about the nanjing massacre , an event commemorated annually by the party china says japanese troops killed 300 , 000 chinese starting on dec 13 , 1937 , in that city we do n't know about the bombings of chongqing , he said so requiem is the story not just of china during the war , but also of the partial histories of that war , and of one man s grand ambition , frequently thwarted , to speak from , and to , the soul of his country without using a single word officials first approached mr wang , who has written eight other symphonies , in the 1980s , eager to commission a piece about the war they wanted him to use words to tell the narrative he refused the project was dropped several times it kills the music , he said no words can describe these events i use crying voices there are all kinds of crying cries are all different among the influences were the poems hymn to the fallen and summoning of the soul by qu yuan , who lived around 300 bc during the warring states period an important breakthrough came during a stay in new york in 1994 , when mr wang came across musical scores at columbia university , including works by the polish composer and , a french composer of greek origin they unlocked the creativity he needed the work is at moments highly lyrical , with majestic harmonies , then abruptly dissonant the singers cry , shout , even imitate gunshots it s hurting my vocal cords , said mr sun , the baritone , who imitates a highpitched trumpet , a chinese wind instrument often played outdoors and at weddings because of its piercing quality stylistically , it s subversive , mr sun said also in the score are , from shaanxi province , and the stately musical style of qu yuan s era during a rehearsal break , the conductor wang linlin \( not related to wang xilin \) said , i do n't know what spirit drives him to write like this the score is more than 300 pages long , he said , flipping through it it s a very heroic work , mr wang said it would be hard even for a young man to do but he s crazy some conductors are afraid to work with him i was n't , he added he s a totally pure and true person there s nothing false or empty about him wang xilin commented , i have a lot of anger , a lot of fire in me for years , especially since 1985 , when mr wang says he picked up the work again once his life settled down after the years of persecution , rumors circulated about requiem among china s composers and musicians we 've known about it for so long , and finally we 're getting a chance to hear it , said the conductor , mr wang though wang xilin s work will be performed only once on dec 13 , the named last year coincidentally , also mr wang s 79th birthday it will be filmed and recorded , the composer said he did not know whether a dvd would be released asked why the piece would be performed only once , an assistant for guan xia , the head of the china national symphony orchestra , said mr guan was unavailable for comment
foxborough , mass coach and quarterback said thursday that they had no knowledge of how the new england came to use underinflated footballs in sunday s afc championship game against the indianapolis colts in front of a sea of mostly unfamiliar faces at a morning news conference , belichick addressed what he called the football issue , which had lured so many to gillette stadium and prompted boston television stations to interrupt programming to carry the news conference live he said he was shocked when he arrived at work monday morning and heard the news that the were said to have used footballs that did not meet the s inflation guidelines multiple news reports over the last few days indicated that the nfl had found that as many as 11 of the 12 footballs the patriots used were inflated significantly below league requirements i had no knowledge whatsoever of this situation until monday morning , belichick said , adding i can tell you that in my entire coaching career , i have never talked to any player , staff member about football air pressure that is not a subject that i have ever brought up when a ball is underinflated , it can be easier for a quarterback to grip in cold or wet conditions , and can also be easier for a receiver to catch belichick acknowledged that individual players may have their own inflation preferences for game balls and deferred to brady s preferences in a sign that the patriots may be trying to move on from this issue , the team moved brady s news conference from friday to thursday he stepped to the same podium hours later and said he was as shocked as belichick was monday when he learned of the report that said the team s game balls were underinflated brady said he followed all his normal routines sunday and had no idea what occurred between the time he chose the game balls and the time they appeared on the field from the first half to the second half , i did n't put one thought into the footballs , brady said i thought we won the game fair and square brady said he would never break the rules he added that he had not been contacted by the nfl , which said it was still investigating the issue belichick declined to answer repeated questions about how the incident occurred , telling persistent questioners that he had told them all he knew and that he had no explanation for what had happened he said the patriots were cooperating with the nfl , fully , quickly and completely with every request they made he also said the patriots would take the necessary steps from now on to make sure their footballs were properly inflated brady was more congenial than belichick , but in the end , he had little to add , even though as a quarterback he is intimately involved in the selection of gameday footballs brady said he liked game balls inflated to 125 pounds per square inch of pressure , the minimum required but he said he did not notice anything out of the ordinary during sunday s game , which the patriots won , 457 everyone s trying to figure out what happened , brady said i was as surprised as anyone at what happened with none of the reporters apparently interested in how the patriots would contain the seattle seahawks stars marshawn lynch and russell wilson in the super bowl , belichick left the podium shortly after he had arrived this was the most widely anticipated belichick briefing since july 2013 , when he talked about the arrest of tight end aaron hernandez , who was accused of murder in the june 2013 death of odin lloyd until thursday , he had deflected questions about the footballs , saying he had been unaware of the issue until monday morning and that the league was handling the matter he said that he had learned more about pressure and inflation guidelines over the previous 72 hours than at any other time in his 40year coaching career i had no knowledge of the various steps involved in the game balls and the process that happened between when they were prepared and went to the officials and went to the game , he said so i 've learned a lot about that he continued to me , the footballs are approved by the league and game officials pregame , and we play with what s out there and that s the only thing i have ever thought about that he said he could not remember even handling a football during a game matthew slater , a team captain , said he viewed the patriots as a pillar of integrity in the community and called the situation unfortunate slater added as an organization , and as a team , we try to do the right thing it s unfortunate this situation has presented itself , and we have to deal with it the best way we can we will move forward that is the message that has been relayed through this locker room center ryan wendell snapped the ball 78 times in the victory over the colts just felt like any other game , wendell said felt the same throughout the game so i do n't know what the difference would be wide receiver brandon lafell , in his first season with the patriots , said we 've had our backs to the wall before , but we always find a way around here , it s do your job' and only worry about what you can control' this is no different
paris a new stage with around 30 original commissions each year , featuring artists from the worlds of film , design , theater and visual art a forum for literature that will feed into the creation of new operas and ballets associated exhibitions and readings and , eventually , a subscription model that will make money these are the ambitious ideas of benjamin millepied , the director of the paris opera ballet , and they began to take shape last week with the introduction of a venture called the name means third stage , suggesting that an additional home for work has been added to the opera s existing houses at the palais garnier and the op ra bastille in this case , the stage is a virtual one , accessed via the paris opera website , and for its debut , it is offering 18 short films and photographic series by a variety of artists some are wellknown \( the actordirector mathieu amalric , the illustrator glen keane \) others are not \( the modeldirector loren denis , the photographerdirector jacob sutton \) almost all use dance , music or the opera houses as their subjects , although sometimes in an abstract or fantastical manner the idea , mr millepied said in a telephone interview , is that the content is entirely original rather than linked to productions being performed by the opera or ballet companies we are the first arts organization to really take this step , he said it sends out a strong message that the paris opera is a creative place , and through our choice of collaborators it will reach a young , curious public who might be interested in the arts , in film , in technology or fashion , but who have never come to the opera or a ballet is the venture sustainable , since it is certainly costing the paris opera money to produce , and its ability to draw a coveted young public to the website and the theaters is as yet untested \? mr millepied said that although the platform was free , he thought that it could serve as a building block for a new , profitable arm of the paris opera that would eventually offer monthly subscriptions and allow people to access special content and performances there are people all over the world who know about the paris opera , want to visit it , but ca n't come to paris or ca n't get tickets when they do come , he said you want to make people dream when they see these films , and to draw them in , then build on that with social media and live content clearly the next step is going to be watching ballet and opera on your computer to some extent , this is already happening in other places the berlin philharmonic and the vienna state opera livestream most of their concerts to paying subscribers the , a venture supported by european union , offers free livestreamed performances from 15 theaters across the continent \( not including the paris opera \) and the metropolitan opera in new york has run since 2008 , and has around 10 , 000 subscribers the idea of adding the lure of new creative content that is not available in theaters is , however , an unpredictable element in the mix opera houses are thinking about how to use media in different ways , said kasper holten , the director of opera at the royal opera house in london it s hard to move beyond just filming operas in the house and screening that , and think about how to create art that is made specifically for these new formats we 'll all be watching what comes out of the paris opera experiment such an experiment is only possibly in the statesubsidized environment of an organization like the paris opera , in which raising money and creating revenue streams is , as yet , not the same imperative it is for american arts groups peter gelb , the general manager of the metropolitan opera , who introduced the hugely successful of opera productions in movie theaters in 2006 , pointed out that while many opera and theater organizations use digital platforms very successfully , almost none made any money i think the met is unique in making a net profit from the movie theater transmissions we do , and that is because of a big global audience and content that is already paid for , he said but i applaud benjamin millepied for trying a new way to reach beyond the physical audience in the theater mr millepied said st phane lissner , the director of the paris opera , was supportive of the idea from the outset mr millepied , in addition to drawing on the opera s resources , had secured sponsorship and raised about half of 3e sc ne s budget of around 1 million euros , or 11 million the assigned staff is , for the moment , minimal , with the former dancer and film producer dimitri chamblas as artistic director , and only one other fulltime staff member we are borrowing from different services finance , press , audiovisual , mr chamblas said in a telephone interview but he acknowledged that the model probably could not be sustained at the current pace clearly we ca n't ask this much of everyone all the time , he said mr chamblas said he and mr millepied had worked together to choose a variety of artists from different fields we wanted people with a vision , an aesthetic , not necessarily close to dance or opera , he said most take the lives of the dancers or the mysteries of the opera house as their subjects sometimes literally , as in arnaud uyttenhove s , about a young corps de ballet member some more abstractly , as in mr amalric s on the body and the singing voice , with the singer barbara hannigan , or julien pr vieux s , which refer to 19thcentury photographs recording motion whether a conceptually highminded venture of this sort can attract the viewing numbers that mr millepied hopes for is still in question so far , the figures are promising since its introduction last tuesday , the 3e sc ne page has been visited around 225 , 000 times , with mr keane s film , nephtali , attracting more than 140 , 000 views on youtube , although most of the other numbers remain in the low thousands \( the youtube numbers and the paris opera website numbers are now calculated separately \) it was a dream for me to be invited into that world , and to be told , just be yourself , said mr keane , a wellknown animator who has worked extensively with the walt disney studios on films like the little mermaid i'm hoping that this will lead to further work with the company , perhaps on a ballet mr millepied said that the projects exposed the dancers or musicians to artists they might never otherwise encounter and that continuing collaborations were another potential benefit and he maintained his stance on the financial viability of the enterprise we have to find new ways of bringing in money , beyond ticket sales and a gala or two , he said we 're just starting to scratch the surface of what we can do
congratulations , you 're no longer a felon we all owe you an apology so we 're sorry , barry , that the government dragged you into courtrooms for more than a decade and forced you to spend some of the 200 million or so you made in baseball not on vacations and fast cars and gigantic ball caps , but on defense lawyers and we 're sorry , barry , that federal prosecutors wasted your time trying to prove that you obstructed justice in your testimony to a grand jury in 2003 , and that you were sentenced to what must have been 30 agonizing days of house arrest inside your 15 , 000squarefoot mansion , rambling around its six bedrooms , its 10 bathrooms , its gym and its pool a federal court s ruling on wednesday , and that changes everything it s clear now that we should be ashamed that we ever thought you were using steroids so what if your body changed into something like the michelin man s before our very eyes torso as thick as a quarter horse , and bulging biceps that seemed to grow bigger by the second , as if attached to an invisible bicycle pump big deal that you started swatting home runs almost as fast as we could count them everything gets easier with age , right \? especially with a wholesome regimen of flaxseed oil and arthritis cream \( and certainly not a designer steroid , which came in the form of a clear liquid , or testosterone , which was a cream \) your oil and your cream were just pretty darn strong i see now that we should have taken you at your word all along i for the nearly monthlong trial in 2011 , and i heard your grand jury testimony and listened to the evidence when you spoke to the grand jury , you said that you had no idea your trainer was giving you drugs of course , you did n't know why would you \? you were just a lowkey , na ve guy duped by someone on your payroll most days i was directly behind your mother , pat , and her friends , including one who filled out a bible word finder day after day at times , it was painful there was testimony about your testicle size and your mistress and the breast implants you said you bought her and the acne she noticed on your back none of that should have ever happened to you , a famous celebrity child of a famous ballplayer simply having a rough time in the spotlight s glare but those days are past now it s time to exhale i am excited about what the future holds for me , you said after wednesday s ruling we 're so excited for you , too ! without that felony conviction on your record , you are free to own a firearm , to serve on a jury , even to run for office \( maybe that s something you should consider after all , you 're still a hero in san francisco \) maybe there s even a job in baseball for you commissioner rob manfred  but that s for after your celebration for now , it s so good to see you get back on your feet , doing what you do best mentoring younger players i heard you spent some time over the winter , too wow , you guys both of you persecuted so unfairly for so long must have had a lot to talk about anyway , welcome back now that the courts have exonerated you , we can return you to your place in the pantheon of sports heroes who accomplished amazing things that seemed too good to be true like lance armstrong , who came back from cancer to win seven titles or , er , maybe there s a better example
amman , jordan the extremists of the islamic state managed to parlay their japanese and jordanian hostages into 12 days of worldwide publicity but other than depleting their supply of foreign hostages , did they really accomplish anything \? analysts who study terrorist groups were skeptical , and many said the militants' tactics had backfired badly , particularly in the extremists apparently killed two japanese men , but failed to achieve either of their professed goals 200 million in ransom , and the release of a female iraqi suicide bomber from death row in jordan their a captive jordanian air force pilot \( and their failure to produce evidence that he was alive \) did not achieve the intended effect of undermining support for jordan s role in the international coalition bombing the islamic state now even skeptical jordanians have begun their government s position and denouncing the extremists that shift comes as the islamic state , also known as or isil , has nearly run out of western or other foreign hostages , as fewer aid workers and journalists dare to enter syrian territory last august , when the americanled bombing campaign began , the group held now they are believed to have four hostages viewed as prominent internationally , including two westerners the extremists continue to hold an untold number of syrians the group released a video showing the apparent beheading of the journalist kenji goto , who was captured when he last october in a bid to find haruna yukawa , a japanese adventurer who disappeared there in august a video showing a still image of was released by the group on jan 24 beginning on jan 20 , mr goto was forced by his captors to plead for his life , directing those entreaties at prime minister shinzo abe similarly heartrending messages were sent from his wife and mother in his final days in mr goto s apparent last moments , the islamic state s executioner , known as jihadi john for his britishaccented english , who appears in many of the beheading videos , taunted mr abe this knife will not only slaughter kenji , but will also carry on and cause carnage wherever your people are found mr abe responded that japan will cooperate with the international community and make the terrorists pay the price he added , i'm outraged by the despicable terrorist act , and i will never forgive the terrorists jordanian officials were more circumspect , as their pilot remains at the extremists' whim jordan s offer to trade him for the suicide bomber , remains on the table but jordanian society underwent a sea change in its attitude toward the coalition last week , as the fate of the pilot , first lt moaz alkasasbeh , transfixed the country even many jordanians said the hostage crisis showed they were involved in someone else s war seemed to change their minds , especially after the horrible images of mr goto s killing emerged from day 1 of jordan joining the coalition against isis , part of our people believed it s not our war , said oraib alrantawi , director of the alquds center for political studies here another part felt that sooner or later it will be , so it s better to fight them in the backyard of another country than in our own bedrooms moaz is in every bedroom in jordan now , said naif laymoun , a member of jordan s parliament who is from lieutenant kasasbeh s hometown , karak we are not going to let anyone exploit this issue to turn us against the government mr amoun added , in the last couple of days , the treatment of the pilot backfired against isis instead of dividing jordan , jordanians are more united behind their government ora szekely , a political scientist at clark university in massachusetts who studies extremist groups like isis , said that nonstate actors like the islamic state are much less coherent and cohesive than they want us to think they are since the extremists seemed to have no coherent strategy in how they handled the japanese and jordanian hostages , their most likely goal was public relations and it was a flop , she said there is a certain amount of making this up as they go along killing the second japanese was a big mistake and they got nothing for it , said clark mccauley , a psychology professor at bryn mawr college who studies political radicalization these people are in many ways their own worst enemies you just have to give them time and space and their extremity will alienate their own base hassan abu hanieh , an ammanbased political analyst who follows extreme islamist groups , cautioned that the islamic state still has the pilot assuming he is alive and may well use his fate to try to shift jordanian public opinion jordan is one of four arab countries participating in airstrikes against isis while isis cares little about public opinion in japan or britain or the united states , two other countries whose nationals have been beheaded jordan is a different matter it has goals for expansion into jordan , and when isis realized this is a losing game on their end , they stopped the game and killed the japanese , but not lieutenant kasasbeh , mr hanieh said other than the jordanian pilot , isis is known to be holding two western hostages the british journalist john cantlie , who has made a series of videotaped speeches on behalf of isis , and an american female aid worker , whose identity is being kept confidential another female aid worker from an undisclosed country is also being held in addition , three staff workers for the international committee of the red cross disappeared in october 2013 , although no information has been released about their identities or who abducted them the islamic state reportedly has been paid millions of dollars in ransom for its hostages , particularly in the past six months , making hostagetaking an important form of financing as one journalist working along the border between turkey and put it recently , journalists in syria are seen as walking bags of money unsurprisingly , most journalists and foreign aid workers are now avoiding syria entirely raising fears that the extremists would begin taking hostages elsewhere the fbi has recently obtained credible information indicating members of an isilaffiliated group are tasked with kidnapping journalists in the region and returning them to syria , american law enforcement officials warned journalists in an october bulletin members of this group might try to mask their affiliation with isil to gain access to journalists many journalists working in the area are well aware of the risks isis has a network of agents roaming the areas that mostly attract journalists , near the border , said zaher said , a syrian who works for western journalists in the gaziantep area of southern turkey they disguise themselves as drivers or fixers offering to help journalists work in the south of turkey , in order to establish good ties with them for a future plan of kidnapping them to the other side of the border , said mr said most experienced journalists were aware of the risks in turkey , and so far none had been kidnapped there it is not only isis and its network that poses a risk , but also selfmotivated bounty hunters , he said
it was both fascinating and disappointing that race relations in america were not directly addressed during the marathon wednesday night republican debate , the second round , this time at the ronald reagan presidential library in simi valley , calif this is particularly baffling at this moment in the nation s history , as issues of race consume the news and watercooler conversations found that race relations racism was third on the list of things americans considered the most important issues facing this country the economy in general and dissatisfaction with government congress ranked above it , but many of the issues that received a tremendous amount of attention at the debates were below it , things like immigration , the judicial system , terrorism and foreign policy and large numbers of americans see race relations as deteriorating in this country for instance , this from  a conducted last week reveals that nearly six in 10 americans , including heavy majorities of both whites and blacks , think race relations are generally bad , and that nearly four in 10 think the situation is getting worse by comparison , twothirds of americans surveyed shortly after took office said they believed that race relations were generally good furthermore , released last month found that americans rate blackwhite relations much more negatively today than they have at any point in the past 15 years currently , 47 percent say relations between blacks and whites are very good' or somewhat good , ' a steep decline from 70 percent in 2013 and yet , nothing specific at the debates sure , they hinted at the issue of race , broadly speaking , but a hint is not a hit senator rand paul spoke about the disparate treatment received by children of kids who had privilege and poor kids in our inner cities when it comes to drug arrests , prosecutions and jail time paul said there is at least one prominent example on the stage of someone who says they smoked pot in high school , and yet the people going to to jail for this are poor people , often africanamericans and often hispanics , and yet the rich kids who use drugs are n't paul was referring to jeb bush , who responded , he was talking about me bush continued so , 40 years ago , i smoked marijuana , and i admit it i'm sure that other people might have done it and may not want to say it in front of 25 million people my mom s not happy that i just did the comment drew laughter but paul s point still stood this unequal treatment is not a laughing matter bush even went on to turn away from the racial disparity that negatively affects young black and brown people to a drug issue that particularly affects young white people in new hampshire heroin ben carson said , i see us allowing people to divide us , when in fact our strength is in our unity this idea of him as the addresser of division , particularly racial division , and the antidote to it has become a bedrock of his candidacy just this week , the carson campaign sent out a fundraising letter that included black lives matter as one of what he called the phrases of the purveyors of division , who seek every day to pit one group of americans against the other during the undercard debate , the doomed louisiana governor bobby jindal repeated his catchphrase immigration without assimilation is invasion jindal spoke of his parents immigrating to the united states they did n't come here to be hyphenated americans there was rick santorum s misguided invocation of the rev dr martin luther king jr , in defense of kim davis , the kentucky clerk who has refused on religious grounds to issue licenses to samesex couples and finally , when asked during the main debate what woman each candidate would like to see on the 10 bill , rosa parks was a favorite among those who actually chose a historical figure instead of making a platitudinous nod to a family member senators marco rubio and ted cruz chose parks , although cruz said that he would put her on the 20 bill , not the 10 he wants to keep alexander hamilton on the 10 bill rubio , the first to mention parks , did n't even specify her contribution to the racial history , going instead for the more oblique an everyday american that changed the course of history even the republican frontrunner chose parks \( no , i'm still not using his name because i'm still smarting over the obscenely disproportionate and undeserved media coverage he has received \) jeb bush , however , did not choose parks inexplicably , he did not even choose an american he chose margaret thatcher , the former british prime minister seriously , jeb \? you could n't think of a single american woman worthy of going on an american currency \? actually , the whole of team jeb ! seems to have some sort of fascination with britain according to , a newly released jeb ! campaign video by his super pac , called bright , about the former florida governor s optimism about america s future , uses stock video images from england and asia that s just sloppy there is no excuse for the omission of race relations from this debate none they should have been asked directly and should have been given time to answer sufficiently as it stood , even after 15 republican candidates filled the stage , race remained the largest elephant in the room

many roads can lead to the nfl playoffs some teams get there with offense , others with defense or special teams some have depth , while others ride a superstar through the regular season at 781 , the are just the second nfl team with a losing record to qualify for postseason play in a nonstrike season vince lombardi may have believed winning was the only thing , but for carolina , the key to a playoff berth this season was geography the defending champions of the nfc south , the panthers were able to despite winning five fewer games than last season by virtue of the division collapsing on itself , going a combined 10291 in nondivisional games the afc north in particular brutalized the nfc south , going 1231 yet through the quirks of the nfl postseason format , carolina , as a division winner , will have homefield advantage over the 115 in saturday s wildcard matchup the philadelphia eagles , however , at 106 , will be sitting at home wondering what might have been if they played their home games a few states farther south still , the panthers have won four consecutive games they find themselves favored by 6 points against a cardinals team that two quarterbacks and nine weeks ago was considered a candidate to be the first nfl team to play a in its home stadium it tells you that no matter what you do during the regular season , it just does n't matter , panthers running back jonathan stewart said this week things amp up to a whole different notch in the playoffs stewart s team can take heart in knowing that the only other sub500 nonstrikeyear nfl playoff team , the 2010 seattle seahawks , won their firstround matchup , against the defending super bowl champion new orleans saints they were eliminated the next week , but making the second round was a remarkable result for a team that lost five of its last seven regularseason games and was outscored by 97 points during the season the underdog role , i think we cherished it and kind of took it to heart , seattle s said after the playoff win against new orleans nobody gave us a chance and we just kind of shrugged our shoulder there was plenty of handwringing and eyerolling at the time as to whether a losing team had any business being in the playoffs , but there was precedent , of a sort in the bizarre 1982 season , a 57day player strike resulted in a ninegame season and a playoff format in which 16 of the league s 28 teams qualified that led to the detroit lions and the cleveland browns earning wildcard spots despite going 45 it was just as unpopular in those days for a losing team to be rewarded with a postseason spot , so when the browns were eliminated by the 81 los angeles raiders in the first round , the cleveland plaindealer s article about the game led with justice was served the lions were also sent packing , losing , 317 , to the washington redskins the year before , major league baseball had its only experience with a losing team in the playoffs , also as a result of a player strike a work stoppage began on june 12 , and play did not resume until aug 9 the decision was made to split the season in two and have firsthalf champions play secondhalf champions in an extra divisional playoff round the kansas city royals were 5053 overall , which easily qualifies as the worst record for a playoff team in mlb history , but they had the excuse that in the season s second half they were 3023 and became the game s only american league west second half champions , a title that is unlikely to be resurrected anytime soon baseball purists were undoubtedly happy when the underwhelming royals were swept out of the playoffs three games to none by the oakland athletics , who were 6445 over all another strike in 1994 canceled the world series but also saved baseball from some embarrassment as the texas rangers were leading the american league west with a record of 5262 when the season was called off those circumstances are easy enough to write off as flukes , but what the nfl will want to avoid is wading into the territory of the nhl and the nba , where winning is hardly a prerequisite for postseason play in 1938 a 14259 record could not stop the chicago black hawks from winning the stanley cup finals the toronto maple leafs duplicated the feat in 1949 , going 222513 before winning the finals in 2012 , the los angeles kings won the stanley cup after officially going 402715 but the 15 represents overtime losses , not ties , so the team s record could instead be viewed as 4042 it is the nba , however , that has made an art of celebrating regularseason futility it began in 194748 , the fledgling league s second season , when the boston celtics were 2028 , earning a playoff spot the competition was not fierce , as the providence steam rollers were the only team that did not qualify for at least a tiebreaking playoff game a few years from becoming an unstoppable dynasty , the celtics of that season lost in the first round of the playoffs and were most notable for featuring chuck connors , a rare twosport athlete who went on to play baseball for the brooklyn dodgers and the chicago cubs before starring in the television show the rifleman the next season three losing teams made the nba playoffs and by 194950 , there were four the syracuse nationals in 195051 became the first nba team with a losing record to win a playoff series when they beat the philadelphia warriors in a twogame sweep behind the hall of famer dolph schayes and the playercoach al cervi before falling to the knicks in the eastern division finals in all , 100 nba teams have qualified for at least a tiebreaking playoff game , with 198586 serving as either the high or low point , depending on your perspective , as six sub500 teams made the playoffs those teams have not found much success , though , as a losing team has advanced to the second round just 18 times with three making it to a conference final the key to success , it seems , is to have a talented big man on the roster , as elgin baylor and moses malone each led a losing team to the nba finals , with baylor s 195859 minneapolis lakers and malone s 198081 houston rockets both just missing a shot at a championship as teams that had no business being there the panthers , despite being more talented than their record implies , are unlikely to join the black hawks , the maple leafs and the kings as losingteamscrownedchampions but they are part of a long , if not proud , line of losing teams to make the playoffs and if the cardinals do not find some answers on offense , carolina may begin the postseason with a win , which would give hope to losing teams everywhere
we are hard pressed to think of many worldclass liberal arts colleges with entire student bodies ambitiously studying and training toward a single profession and in uniforms that are far from vassar s or columbia s baseball caps or yoga pants while the culinary institute of america prepares its student chefs for successful careers in hospitality , just across the hudson river , the united states military academy at west point s mission is to educate , train and inspire its own student body for the profession of arms the two institutions seem worlds apart , yet conversations over a couple of meals quickly demonstrate otherwise most readers will be familiar with west point s role in american history , dating back to when george washington , as a general , recognized the strategic importance of the real estate perched on the west bank of the hudson river its neighbor is similarly steeped in military history despite no small amount of capitol hill gridlock , congress passed the servicemen s readjustment act of 1944 , known as the gi bill of rights , to support veterans transitions into civilian life frances roth , a lawyer , and katharine angell , the wife of james rowland angell , then the president of yale , created the new haven restaurant institute , the culinary center of the nation , with the mission to retrain returning world war ii veterans for postwar livelihoods within four years of opening its doors in 1946 , 600 veterans from 38 states had graduated from the institute , and eleanor roosevelt , the former first lady and a supportive neighbor at hyde park , even helped settle the debate about whether culinary should be pronounced cullinairee or coolinairee \( the former won out \) in 1970 , the culinary institute of america purchased the st andrewonhudson jesuit novitiate and moved the school from connecticut to its current rockbound highland home in new york a mere 50 years ago , americans would have known veterans and heard their stories at the peak of world war ii , just shy of 10 percent of the population was serving in the military today about 05 percent of the population serves in the armed forces with such contrast between then and now , it is little wonder that young people have scarce knowledge of or experience with those in uniform , even with the recent conflicts in iraq and afghanistan the gaps in historical memory and civilmilitary understanding cut both ways despite the schools proximity , today s era of celebrity chefs and the food network means west pointers are better equipped to name the culinary institute of america graduates anthony bourdain and duff goldman than to recount their neighbor s rich military history cadets certainly know what awaits when opening a can of chef boyardee , but few can recall that ettore boiardi s company was commissioned to operate around the clock to feed american soldiers during world war ii and when we mention our partnership with the cia , our army colleagues quickly assume we are referring to spooks , not chefs in 2012 , the west point professors brian and terry babcocklumish met rich vergili , a cia faculty member , at a slow food hudson valley event while picking organic strawberries at thompsonfinch farm , the three found themselves comparing teaching experiences at their respective schools , and imagined the conversations their students might have if given the opportunity since then , the two institutions have grown closer , and in doing so , are reclaiming their common history an initiative started on the anniversary of the sept 11 attacks , the day in the life exchange , is now an established program each fall and spring semester , during which 10 competitively selected west point cadets are paired with 10 student chefs to take turns spending the day on one another s turf when hosting in hyde park , the student chefs quickly put the west pointers , sporting iconic chef s whites and toques , to work in the bustling kitchens of roth hall , uniformly cubing carrots and dicing potatoes for cadets without access to kitchen facilities and limited to one regulated appliance in cramped barracks rooms , even holding a knife properly can be a new and dangerous experience when the cia students arrive at the academy , they are immediately launched into a simulation as if they were new cadets reporting for duty chefs step up to the academy s fearsome cadet in the red sash a tradition of reception day and go on to march in formation , fire simulation weapons and complete obstaclebased workouts the point is never to overwhelm or haze , but to immerse in doing so , future leaders are encouraged to build relationships challenging assumptions , combating misconception and starting a dialogue early in their careers when it comes to food , many west pointers are socialized to prioritize quantity over quality an army may march on its stomach a bad meal , or no meal , adversely affects everyone the prospect of stopping , savoring and appreciating complex flavors does not fit neatly into aggressive schedules involving military responsibilities and parade practice on top of problem sets and papers in contrast , aspiring chefs relish the opportunity to explore the area s farms , sourcing local ingredients and brainstorming dishes to which they will dedicate hours while visiting the academy , they find themselves most at home in the bowels of washington hall , exploring the spotless kitchen complex commercial combi ovens and giant hobart mixers responsible for producing tremendous quantities of food daily despite initial anxieties , none of these students are strangers to the rigors of basic training today s chefs are steeped in the tradition of auguste escoffier , who canonized cooking techniques and recipes , and created the kitchen brigade system that keeps today s professional kitchens ticking cadets and chefs recognize their many parallels grace under pressure is essential attention to detail matters and a certain obsession with logistics is critical to success , even if manifested differently across the hudson or throughout one s career when the conversations turn to hopes and concerns for their future , or dating and drinking the following weekend , distinctions quickly blur although we collaborate with the cia s leaders to convene these initial visits , a successful partnership quickly takes on a life of its own armed with facebook and smartphones , 21yearolds are 21yearolds and definitely do not need their professors interfering this is precisely the point before his retirement after 43 years in uniform , adm mike mullen , then the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff , addressed the increasing civilmilitary divide in american society reliant upon a leaner , allvolunteer force isolated on fewer military installations after base closures , americans have less exposure to service members at the same time , gen martin e dempsey , the current chairman of the joint chiefs and a former west point english instructor , insists that the civilmilitary dialogue must go both ways failure to do so will exacerbate the disconnect between the military and the broader society it serves on the civilian side , the state department s diplomatic culinary partnership elevates the role of food in america s public diplomacy efforts abroad however , one need not be an ambassador to recognize the value of food in bringing people together across borders and boundaries most cultures view food as far more than sustenance , but as a textured form of communication , rich with both flavor and meaning understanding not only what one eats but also where it comes from , how it is prepared and who has a seat at the table offers tremendous insight into a community and its priorities ultimately , breaking and making bread together offers invaluable opportunities to connect cultures and cultivate trust dr terry babcocklumish , president of islay consulting , taught economics at west point from 2012 to 2014 and founded the culinary institute of america partnership with her husband , major brian babcocklumish of the army major erin hadlock

moose lake , minn behind razor wire and locked metal doors , hundreds of men waited on a recent morning to be counted , part of the daily routine inside a remote facility here that was built based on a design for a prison but this is not a prison , and most of these men rapists , child abusers and other sex offenders have completed their sentences they are being held here indefinitely under a policy known as , having been deemed sexually dangerous or sexual psychopathic personalities by courts the intent , the authorities say , is to provide treatment to the most dangerous sex offenders until it is safe for the public for them to go home yet not one of the more than 700 sex offenders who have been civilly committed in minnesota over the past two decades has actually gone home and only a few men have been provisionally discharged to live outside of state facilities under strict supervision you knew you were going to die here , said craig bolte , a sex offender who has been held here nine years and who says he would rather be sent to prison , where there is still hope but now minnesota s civil commitment program which detains more people per capita than any other state is facing an overhaul earlier this year , a federal judge , calling it a punitive system that segregates and indefinitely detains a class of potentially dangerous individuals without the safeguards of the criminal justice system the judge , donovan w frank , of federal district court in st paul , on thursday ordered the state to promptly conduct independent risk and treatment assessments on everyone being detained , to seek releases or ease restrictions in appropriate cases , and to begin conducting annual assessments to determine whether everyone here still meets the legal requirements for civil commitment minnesota is not alone in revisiting its policies in missouri , a that state s program violated people s right to due process , potentially imposing lifetime detention on individuals who have completed their prison sentences and who no longer pose a danger to the public , no matter how heinous their past conduct of about 250 people held since missouri began committing people in 1999 , state officials say seven have been granted what the state considers release with courtordered restrictions , though some of those men remain in a grouphomelike setting behind razor wire at a state facility in texas , which previously had a unique outpatient method for treating sex offenders civilly committed after their prison sentences , the republicandominated state legislature this year revamped the program after found that none of the hundreds committed to the program had ever graduated from it the investigation also found that nearly half of the men detained for treatment while living in halfway houses and other facilities were actually sent back to prison for breaking the program s rules my sense was that we had to make changes or a federal court is going to strike down the whole program , and we need this program some of these people would scare the hell out of you , said state senator john whitmire , a democrat who helped push through the overhaul , which included to house the detainees the way it was , it just looked like incarceration with double jeopardy , mr whitmire said this at least holds out a pathway to graduate civil commitment gained support in the 1990s amid reports of heinous sex crimes by repeat offenders today , 20 states , along with the federal government , for treatment beyond their prison time but not all have been as sharply criticized as minnesota s program in wisconsin , 118 offenders have been fully discharged from commitment since 1994 , and about 135 people have been given supervised release , according to judge frank new york had sent home 30 people and moved 64 people out of secure facilities for the civilly committed and into strict supervision and treatment , judge frank wrote but the picture in minnesota looks far different since the current program was created in the mid1990s , civil commitments have soared the abduction , rape and murder in 2003 of , a north dakota college student , by a sex offender who had been released six months earlier enraged residents and set off a wave of efforts by county attorneys to call on judges to hold such offenders after prison minnesota now has the highest population of civilly committed offenders per capita nearly all men in the nation , judge frank found , and the lowest rate of release and costs have soared to about 125 , 000 per resident per year , at least three times the cost of an ordinary prison inmate in minnesota , the judge said yet even in a state that is often seen as liberalleaning , changing the policy is politically fraught gov mark dayton , a democrat , faced intense criticism before his last election over a plan , later dropped , to release from commitment with strict conditions a rapist who had admitted attacking at least 60 women and proposals to pay for regular risk evaluations for committed people , and other changes , have stalled in the state legislature it s really a stalemate now because the house republicans have made it clear that anybody who supports any kind of step forward is going to be castigated in the 2016 elections , mr dayton said in his order on thursday , judge frank said that political sensitivities had repeatedly hampered efforts to revamp the policy , and that state officials should urge the legislature to provide money to make the changes he was requiring , including regular evaluations the judge added that he was likely to require even more changes later the state indicated that it would seek a stay in the judge s order as it appeals the case in an interview last week , mr dayton said the state s program met constitutional requirements , and noted that more people than ever were permitted to leave the facilities under strict supervision six people have been granted provisional discharges by the courts , officials said three of them are living outside the facilities with close supervision and though no one has ever been entirely released from the commitment system , lucinda jesson , the commissioner of the state human services department , said more people than ever are in a final , a fact that she described as promising i consider myself certainly as committed to improving our social service efforts on behalf of people who need help in our society , mr dayton said but there s a line you need to draw for public safety and these people , if you look at some of their case files , it s repeated , horrific crimes that put them in this situation minnesota s a compassionate state , he continued , but there s a line you 've got to draw no one wants to take a risk with somebody who would rape or murder somebody s spouse or child , and look them in the eye and say , we put your family at risk in any way' linda walker , the mother of ms sjodin , the slain college student , said she was disheartened by the notion that hundreds of men might be reevaluated and considered for less restrictive settings tragically , there are going to be people who have to live in fear that those who chose to perpetrate are quite possibly going to be released back into the society , ms walker said the predators are driving the bus here we need to focus more on the victims what about the rights of the victims \? but critics of minnesota s civil commitment program say it is focused more on warehousing and punishing people than on treating them they say that offenders receive no regular risk assessments to see whether they require more treatment or supervision , and that the treatment program itself has been revised and reinvented repeatedly over the years as new human services employees have come and gone , especially in moose lake , a small town where state officials acknowledge hiring is difficult dan gustafson , a lawyer for the plaintiffs in the classaction lawsuit , said the state s reports of more detainees making progress in the program arrived only recently , and appeared to be largely in response to the criticism by the court and other officials at least 43 men have died while committed there is a pervasive sense of hopelessness among everybody , knowing that there is no out date and knowing that there is no way to complete anything , said mr bolte , who was sent here nine years ago , at age 19 , after being convicted as a juvenile of sexually assaulting a family member and later acknowledging sexual contact with other minors during a troubled childhood critics also complain that the program treats people like mr bolte , whose crimes occurred when they were juveniles , largely the same as it treats adult sex offenders other offenders here are much older one man is 93 and , some suggest , unlikely or even incapable of committing new offenses more than 30 of the men are older than 70 dennis steiner , a balding man who was civilly committed more than two decades ago in lieu of a prison sentence for molesting boys from ages 8 and 17 , said he had done various versions of the state treatment program about seven times he lives in a second state complex in st peter , southwest of the twin cities , where offenders in the later phases of treatment are housed , and allowed increased privileges in a dormitorylike setting mr steiner , who is 66 and wore a suit on a recent morning , clutched a thick binder with scores of documents from treatment over the years , including one that listed plans if he ever emerges from the program attend support groups , follow rules of electronic monitoring , go to outpatient treatment mr steiner , who wants to move in with his mother , 87 , said he would never harm anyone else when do you stop proving that to people \? he said if i ca n't get out on the street and prove it to people , i ca n't keep proving it to people in here over and over
athens , the leftwing candidate who may well become prime minister of next weekend , was taking questions from the public the other night on twitter someone asked if he would eliminate the country s hefty valueadded taxes on basic necessities no , he said , he was not going to promise things we ca n't do but the promises he has made are enough to suggest that greece under his leadership would take a sharp turn from its direction of the past five years , when it has grudgingly adhered to european insistence on deep budget cutting in return for the financial assistance necessary to keep it afloat mr tsipras , boyishly handsome at 40 , leads the syriza party , which polls suggest is likely to control the next government after elections next sunday he has emerged as a more polished figure than he was in 2012 , when he first rose to prominence back then , he was usually described as a leftwing firebrand who posed a potentially lethal challenge to the euro , the european union and even the global economy , if he followed through on his threats to let greece default on its debts or leave the eurozone or both today , he sits atop a newly organized party that is still unabashedly leftwing but has softened its rhetoric and reached out to leaders across the world , even those with differing viewpoints these days , mr tsipras is more likely to talk of negotiation and the need to create a modern european state free of corruption than to applaud default but after years in which ordinary greeks have felt little if any benefit from harsh austerity policies , and with the government still unable to perform basic tasks like tax collection , he is offering voters a populist vision in which they come first he has pledged that on his first day in office , he will begin restoring electricity to poor households that have been cut off and provide food stamps to the growing number of destitute families he and his lieutenants have also declared open season on the oligarchs who have dominated greece economically and politically for decades mr tsipras makes clear that he expects europe in general and germany in particular to make concessions on greece s crushing debt in an interview in his starkly modern office at syriza s modest headquarters recently , he waved aside the perception that he would threaten default , saying it was in everyone s best interest to negotiate a deal let s assume i owe you a million dollars , he said you know you have two options a \) to give me the chance to have some income so i can pay you back , even 50 percent of it , or , b \) let me lose everything , go bankrupt , and you get nothing back what would you choose \? at a time when italy and france , among other countries , are also questioning the germanled austerity orthodoxy , mr tsipras could play a vital role in shaping the european debate he is being watched carefully across europe for signs of whether he really has moderated , or is just toning down his language to avoid scaring middleoftheroad voters his views his promises to restore the minimum wage gradually and to undo reforms that made the labor market more flexible along with his communist past , have prompted some european officials to warn that a tsipras victory could usher in a period of dangerous instability german officials have announced that they have no intention of renegotiating greece s huge debt and hinted that if athens were forced to exit the european union , it would be of little consequence such talk does not seem to trouble mr tsipras , who believes it is all part of a negotiation process already underway while such scaremongering might have worried voters two years ago , he said , with a quarter of the country unemployed and receiving no benefits whatsoever , it now just makes greeks angry mr tsipras used to have a picture of che guevara in his office but today , his renovated space has only one boldly colored painting on the wall two bulls facing off mr tsipras said it captured the aggressive tension that exists in europe if true , it is a tension that sits easily with him he has none of the strut that might fit his party s tough talk he speaks quietly and laughs a lot he has not worn a tie since his required time in the military and does not intend to change his ways i think that if there is something that people appreciate in syriza and me , it is that we have n't assumed this mentality of establishment parties , with specific ways to dress , to act , he said we want to be ourselves , to believe in what we do he says he is worried not so much about winning the election as about piling up a big enough majority to rule without having to form a coalition polls have consistently shown syriza in the lead , with most numbers ranging from 28 to 31 percent prime minister antonis samaras s new democracy party usually polls from 23 to 28 percent but experts say that when undeclared voters weigh in , syriza s lead is likely to rise even higher a tsipras win would put an end to more than three decades of domination by the same two political parties , whose officials often emerge in the morning from mansions in athens' finest neighborhoods both of greece s last two elected prime ministers were educated at amherst college mr tsipras , however , studied engineering at athens university and still rents his home in a mixed neighborhood of aging buildings and narrow streets he has greatly improved his english in the last few years he says that his party has ruled out any sort of partnership with the two traditional parties , mr samaras s new democracy party and former prime minister george papandreou s leftcenter party , pasok we cannot cooperate with the powers that brought greece to the edge of the cliff , he said we want to implement sweeping reform in public administration , in how the state is run we want to clash with this financial oligarchy that was ruling all these years in cooperation with the political establishment we cannot do that if we form alliances with the political establishment that favored , and was favored by , the oligarchy this is why we say that syriza is a chance for greece to become a normal , modern european country again this part of his agenda would fit in well with the views of greece s international creditors but other parts of his agenda aim to roll back many costcutting measures , gradually restoring salaries and pensions and lowering the tax on to make it more affordable \( which could actually bring in more revenue , some experts believe \) these might be harder for the lenders to accept critics fear that mr tsipras and his advisers are sitting atop a stillyoung organization that pulled together supporters with divergent views , from marxists to disgruntled members of pasok , a mix that could prove hard to navigate some in the business community are also concerned that the party has talked more about the humanitarian crisis in greece than what needs to be done to stimulate growth all the ideas in his program come from people who are not in touch with the real economy , said thanasis mavridis , the managing editor of the financial newspaper and website  mr tsipras s gift for political leadership emerged early he first made headlines when he was a teenager , already a member of the youth wing of the communist party and leading student rallies against education reforms he met his partner , peristera baziana , also a member of the party , in high school they have two children mr tsipras left the communists and , after graduating , went into business as a civil engineer in 2006 , he ran for mayor of athens , and after doing surprisingly well in the polls , he turned to politics full time friends of mr tsipras said that his ability to stay calm was uncanny in 2009 , a clownish greek comedian , who was making his mark ambushing and humiliating politicians , took aim at mr tsipras but mr tsipras greeted him with open arms , bantered , laughed and even had the last word he is our nuclear weapon , said nikos pappas , his chief of staff his political opponents are trying to paint him as a dangerous radical who would force greece to leave the european union mr tsipras has responded by ridiculing the critics , saying that he has now read that he would ban religious icons , block a proposal to build a football stadium and outlaw hunting in one recent interview , he said he had been accused of doing everything except stealing other men s women he said that after all they had read about him , european union officials were always pleasantly surprised to find that he was a reasonable man who could discuss different ideas in some ways , he said of the critics , they did me a favor
much art is made for pleasure or profit some is made to save lives and souls the 15 , standing like thorny trees in a grove , at the end of kongo power and majesty at the metropolitan museum of art , are examples of art of the rescuing kind they are sculptural responses to a slowmotion emergency , one that shaped the history of the african continent and continues to resonate there today for centuries the west assumed that africa had no history , because none had been found written down instead , it was said to be timeless in the way that the primitive was timeless that is , retarded , suspended in backwardness call that a state of innocence call it savagery either way , it was a condition to be patronized , corrected , exploited only beginning in the late 20 century , when the notion of primitivism came under widespread critical fire , were the antiquity and dynamism of african cultures acknowledged , and demonstrated in longresearched exhibitions like this one , which has been organized by alisa lagamma , the curator in charge of the department of the arts of africa , oceania and the americas it begins at a very specific time and place the coast of central africa in 1483 , the year a navigator named diogo c o , on a pioneering mission for the portuguese court , landed near the mouth of the congo river to scout possibilities for trade he carried on board several sevenfoothigh limestone columns carved with a cross and the royal coat of arms with them , he staked territorial claims for portugal in what is now angola all but one of those columns vanished long ago the sole survivor is at the met , introducing the exhibition in much the way that , centuries ago , it introduced europe to africa , and vice versa the portuguese had landed in territory occupied by kongo peoples , who formed several separate states ruled by kings in urban courts similar to those of europe and the initial encounter was auspicious , viewed by both sides as a meeting of equals spiritually adventurous and intellectually curious , the kongo elite took an avid interest in christianity and quickly learned the skill of writing one of the earliest items in the show is a 1517 letter from the kongo king to his portuguese counterpart requesting a shipment of prayer books and liturgical instruments we know from records that many thousands of such things subsequently flooded into africa , though none have been tracked down there what has been found are religious images made by african artists after european prototypes a little brass kongo figure of a crucified christ with starburstlike hands and feet is one and western museums hold a small number of objects that , in the 16 and 17 centuries , traveled from africa to europe as souvenirs or gifts , landing in medici palaces and cathedral treasuries a lot of what has been preserved of this precious export material is in the met show , and consists mainly of two types of luxury items elephant tusks carved with exquisite geometric patterns \( one is from the palazzo pitti in florence \) , and woven palmfiber textile panels incorporating the same abstract designs examples of both float , as if on the sea , in the bluewalled opening gallery and they carry history with them the patterns they share appear in almost identical form on african ceramics dating to the late iron age , and on ceremonial caps and capes made between the 16th and the early 20 century the wearers of such regalia included priests or ritual specialists , who played a crucial role in governance the kongo cosmos was generally understood to be made up of two realms , one occupied by the living , the other by the ancestral dead the priest s job was to maintain communication between the two , and to channel otherworldly energy through certain charismatic objects , often sculpted figures called minkisi \( singular , nkisi \) , which policed human behavior and promoted peace social balance and continuance were the highest good , embodied in paired male and female images , and in the perfect , endless abstract patterns woven in textiles and inscribed on ivories about halfway into the show , however , something appears that throws that balance off it s a tusk covered with tiny figures , among them shackled slaves the piece is late , probably from the 1880s , but the realities it documents are much older the rapport between europe and the kingdom of kongo was brief portugal soon made its colonialist intentions clear other western nations france , britain , the netherlands aggressively followed its lead kongo peoples lost their gainful position as gatekeepers to the wealth of the continent s interior worse , the effects of the atlantic slave trade were catastrophic africans had always participated as suppliers but by the mid17 century , kongo territory roughly corresponding to modern angola , congo and the congo republic had itself become a primary source of captives by 1850 , a third of its population had ended up in chains in the americas nor was there relief to be found in africa there the age of colonialism was underway forced labor was common with the adult male population reduced by slavery , the nuclear family , the core unit of kongo social organization , was shattered traditional occupations , economic structures and value systems , along with the communal identity they sustained , were radically destabilized religion was what was left female power figures , depicted as women of idealized beauty supporting and nursing infantsize adult males , proliferated regal but tender , they held the promise of fecundity in a withering time , and certain sculptors made a specialty of them two such artists called the master of kasadi , the master of makaya vista and the master of boma vonde , for the regions where they worked have been identified by style although each adheres to a fixed image type , their approaches , seen in comparative pieces in the show , are distinctive in detail and mood as expressive as these images were , they could do nothing to prevent the reign of terror visited on the kongo world by belgian colonial rule beginning in the 1870s at that point , in what feels like a lastditch move , a shock troop of male power figures , called mangaaka , was brought into play only around 20 are known 15 of those , from collections in europe and the united states , including the met , are in the final gallery just under lifesize , they were carved from wood by master artists fitted with animalhair beards and huge white ceramic eyes , they lean forward , mouths open , as if looking and listening intently , ready to leap their torsos bristle with poundedin spikes and nails , each the seal of a vow made or an injustice to be prosecuted the source of their energy lies in magical substances medicines placed by priests in their hollowedout bellies and behind their eyes such images are the spiritual equivalent of antibodies , designed to hunt down and eliminate infection in a social body on the verge of systemic collapse they were meant to stop a viral history in its tracks , reverse its course they were focused in a way that makes much other art , however ambitious , feel vague in purpose , a distraction from , rather than an engagement with , the politics of living and dying it s a measure of the respect they inspired that all of the figures , brothers in arms , seem to have had their medicine removed before leaving africa the west would get the form but not the substance of their might they make a memorable conclusion to an unusually tight , ideafilled and troubling show when these figures were conceived , the scramble for africa was on fullbore , with western nations barbarously slicing up and devouring a continent that depredation has never stopped , even if some of its participants have changed , china being the latest scrambler and africa s history , embedded in some of the world s most potent art , goes on
inside the javits center complex on the windy , frigid west side of manhattan on sunday morning , there was genuine warmth for the legends most identified as belonging to new york none of them were named  the 16th annual brunch organized by the league s retired players an allstar weekend event informally hosted by anthony , the ' reigning star was turned over to the franchise icons willis reed , walt frazier , bill bradley and earl monroe , along with the homegrown greats kareem abduljabbar , tiny archibald and julius erving , among others all of those former stars could flash championship rings , though for some who never were among the last men standing in june chris mullin and bernard king , to name two it was more about the roots in their collective career stories is a compelling history of the city game and a fair amount of brotherly love the talkative kenny smith of queens did n't brag about the two mid1990s titles he won with the houston rockets , but he sure did n't mind sharing that he had attended frazier s basketball camp as a 9yearold , competed in a tournament run by archibald , played against mullin in high school and worn king s no 30 for much of his career during a panel discussion of bornandbred new yorkers and one \( frazier \) adopted from atlanta , mullin , a brooklyn native , had the crowd chuckling over recollections of having needed peer chaperones to and from the subway when he ventured uptown to the rucker league from his home in flatbush until he had a couple of decent games when i got really good , i started hanging out in harlem , he said the pros do n't do much mingling with the schoolyard masses anymore , least of all the max money players like anthony , who labored stiffly through a 30minute , 14point showing as the western conference defeated the east , 163158 , on sunday night at madison square garden anthony spent his early years in the red hook neighborhood of brooklyn before moving to baltimore wanting to be a homecoming king upon his arrival in new york in early 2011 , anthony spoke of his reverence for the oneman fast break known as bernard , even if the timeline suggested that anthony , born in 1984 , came of spectator age when king was enjoying his last scoring binges with the washington bullets in our allornothing culture , people too often link career legitimacy to the claiming of at least one championship ring , although the new york fan base and news media never blamed king for the failure of his knicks teams to advance beyond the second round of the playoffs the city certainly celebrates in retrospect , at least patrick ewing s titleless years with the knicks so why has anthony become such a polarizing figure in these parts \? why would many longtime seasonticket holders have enthusiastically volunteered to escort him to the city limits when he was flirting with other teams as a free agent last summer \? why is there such strong sentiment that the knicks will never be true contenders with anthony as their leading man \? part of the disenchantment is no doubt related to the knicks' uninspiring play since anthony arrived as a muchheralded savior the team will conclude this season owning one series victory for the last five playoff seasons , and two straight years of finishing out of the postseason unlike king , who dominated high school gymnasiums while at fort hamilton high in brooklyn , anthony has a relationship with new york that has seemed contrived , born more of selfinterest he forced the knicks to surrender multiple assets to get him rather than wait out a season and a labor dispute than a desire to be part of a special group anthony s most transcendent new york night he broke king s singlegame knicks scoring record with a 62point explosion in january 2014 in a blowout of a defenseless charlotte team in some ways reflected what critics have complained about most , the sense that it s always about him some of the carping has amounted to radio static , excess noise , especially the overblown controversy of anthony s desire to play in sunday night s starfest after missing regularseason games with a barking knee that will most likely require shutting down soon for minor surgery yes , money and visibility were his primary reasons for staying in new york , but this season s collapse is more on the team s president , phil jackson , than it is on anthony there was no harm , no foul , in his wanting to have a little fun with lebron james and other olympic team buddies his knee may have hurt but right arm , aim aside , was fine he took 20 shots , made 6 to make the night a complete loss , the first questions directed at anthony in the interview room were about the knicks' buyout of amar'e stoudemire not going to ask me about the weekend \?

hong kong s handling of the discovery of a wing part that apparently came from the missing malaysia airlines boeing 777 has worsened frictions with its partners in the investigation , rekindled frustrations among the families of people who were aboard the plane and further dented the country s battered credibility many questioned the timing and motives of the malaysian prime minister , najib razak , who announced in the early hours of thursday that the wing part had been to be from the missing plane he spoke just before a news conference in paris at which french investigators were much more guarded , saying only that the experts had very strong presumptions that the part came from the plane later on thursday the malaysian transportation minister , liow tiong lai , clouded the picture further when he told reporters in kuala lumpur , the malaysian capital , that a malaysian team had found more aircraft debris on the french island of r union , where the wing part was discovered last week the french authorities in paris denied that any new aircraft debris had been found the discrepancies between the malaysian declarations and what others involved in the investigation into the disappearance of flight 370 , including experts from boeing , were prepared to conclude about the evidence have created significant tensions between malaysian and french officials , according to a person close to the investigation mr najib has domestic political worries , not least a that has put him under intense scrutiny the wall street journal and the sarawak report , a website based in britain , have reported that documents found by investigators in indicate that almost 700 million was transferred to accounts that mr najib is believed to control in late july , mr najib dismissed his deputy prime minister , who had publicly called on him to give a full account of the matter , and the country s attorney general , who was one of the leaders of the investigation into the scandal but exasperation with the malaysian authorities dates to when the plane first disappeared , on a night flight from kuala lumpur bound for beijing in the early hours of march 8 , 2014 ground controllers lost contact with the plane about 40 minutes after takeoff , but the authorities did not issue an alert about the missing plane for hours then , malaysia spent directing a major searchandrescue effort focused on the gulf of thailand , along the plane s scheduled flight path , even though the malaysian military had tracked an unidentified aircraft flying in nearly the opposite direction westward and out into the indian ocean which investigators later concluded was flight 370 eventually , based on the radar data and automated satellite signals received from the jet , investigators concluded that it had flown on for hours more , and probably ran out of fuel and crashed in the indian ocean west or southwest of australia searchers began working from the air , and later scanning the deep ocean floor with sonar devices , but nothing has been found there the wing part was the first tangible trace of the plane to turn up for many people who had loved ones aboard flight 370 , the identification , or nearidentification , of the object only intensified their desire to know how and why the jet had veered off course and flown unnoticed into remote ocean waters chinese citizens made up about twothirds of the 239 people on the plane , and in beijing , relatives of the victims viewed mr najib s announcement with skepticism or outright disbelief on thursday morning , about 20 relatives gathered outside the malaysia airlines office in beijing , demanding to talk to airline representatives and to be flown to more than two dozen police officers kept them from entering the office building we do n't accept this this is not closure , said dai shuqing , who had five relatives on the plane , including her sister the malaysians want to lie to the whole world , but they cannot lie to us we will persevere and keep digging others outside the airline s office held signs with slogans such as malaysia hides the truth later in the day , some of the relatives moved the demonstration to boeing s offices in the city under international aviation conventions , malaysia is leading the overall flight 370 investigation because the aircraft was registered in malaysia and took off from kuala lumpur the ocean search is being led by australia , whose ports are nearest the search area but the wing part found on r union is being examined at a laboratory near toulouse , , because it washed ashore on french territory the paris prosecutor s office has opened an inquiry into the crash because four french citizens were aboard the flight though malaysian officials appeared eager to reach conclusions swiftly and put the mystery of flight 370 behind them , tony abbott , the australian prime minister , said thursday that the ocean search would continue we owe it to the hundreds of millions of people who use our skies , he said meanwhile , jeanpaul virapoull , the mayor of standr , r union , near where the wing debris was found , said thursday that his town would organize a meticulous search of the beaches there next week if it can soothe the terrible pain of these hundreds of families , the city of standr , with the agreement of the relevant international authorities , is ready to erect a memorial for the people who are missing , the mayor said in the statement the person close to the investigation said that volunteers on r union turned in some additional debris to french aviation officials on the island on thursday , but that a preliminary evaluation indicated that none of the objects were from a plane still , david griffin , an australian scientist who has mapped ocean currents in the area , said thursday that he believed more debris from flight 370 could wash up on madagascar , the much larger island nation to the west of r union there could be a very large amount of debris floating , or a very small amount , said mr griffin , who is with the commonwealth scientific and industrial research organization in australia i am slightly surprised that something turned up at r union , rather than madagascar , because madagascar is so much bigger wen wancheng , 63 , whose son was on the aircraft , said finding one wing part did not resolve the mystery of flight 370 the sort of closure the families want is to know what exactly happened to the plane , and have the bodies returned , he said by telephone from jinan , in eastern china that sentiment was shared by other relatives of flight 370 victims around the world , some of whom said that the discovery of the wing part , known as a flaperon , only intensified the mystery ultimately in the end for the families to have a sort of closure , we need to know why it ended up in the ocean , what happened , sara weeks , whose brother paul was a passenger , said in an interview with australian radio from christchurch , new zealand it is really important for everyone because if that plane can go missing , another one can for some , the longing for more evidence has only grown stronger it s a piece of flaperon it s not my husband , said jacquita gonzales , the wife of a flight 370 crew member , patrick gomes ms gonzales was one of a small group of family members who spoke to reporters on thursday in the malaysian city of petaling jaya although they found something , it s not the end , she added they still need to find the whole plane and our spouses as well we still want them back

let the warriors' professor longhair , andre iguodala , tickle a few chords i 've been preparing for this moment for 11 years , iguodala says of his study of the game and of lebron james , whom he covered as well as could be expected it s the 10 , 000hour rule you just try to master your craft the depth of talent on the warriors was overwhelming and beautiful to watch at the same time and we have n't even mentioned stephen curry , the team s great freeform trumpet player to watch him warm up before the final game was almost comical he bounced around with his looselimbed jangle , setting up six , seven feet beyond the 3point arc a higharcing jumper here , another there and there swoosh , swoosh and swoosh he ends his practice session by running to the far left corner , taking a pass as he turns in one motion and falls out of bounds at its apex that shot threatens to tickle the arena s humongotron and hits naught but net at the end of its fall a word on that humongotron there are few arenas in the nba more deafening in their insistent noise than cleveland s this is a city that has longsuffering , passionate fans who are perfectly willing to work themselves into a proper , yellthemselveshoarse frenzy yet cavaliers management all but extinguishes that competitive advantage by loosing that dull , deadening mechanical beast with its dictatorial deefense demands next year , perhaps an enterprising fan could climb up and toss a wrench deep into the humongotron s tonsils free cleveland fans to be as humanly noisy as they can be the coaches , david blatt and steve kerr , played an extraordinary sixgame chess match to cast back on game 2 or 3 is almost to recall a different time forward david lee was exhumed from his crypt on the warriors' bench for a few exciting moments , then laid back to rest timofey mozgov starred , sat , starred again blatt has run enormously creative teams overseas , but he understood that the cavaliers could win only by slowing these west coast hipsters to a crawl kerr understood , just as clearly , that he had to find new ways to put foot to accelerator , forcing the pace at every turn and using his team s strength , which was a talented bench that ran nearly a dozen deep afterward , his shirt and hair soaked in champagne , kerr spoke of the changes sweeping this game he was general manager of the phoenix suns when he watched coach mike d'antoni set loose steve nash , who was steph curry before steph curry steve nash kind of laid out a vision for a whole generation of young point guards , kerr said and they have n't stopped running yet the miami experiment was often misunderstood pat riley s point was not to find stars , so much as to find intelligent masters who could pass and shoot and move in concert when they did that well , that team was no less enjoyable to watch than the spurs or the warriors still , for all this , it was undeniably poignant watching james as the clock ticked down just short of two minutes left in the game , and trailing badly , james for the first time went slack , as though someone had stuck a deflating pin in his back on the bench for a timeout , he covered his face with his jersey smith , the mercurial , postadolescent guard who embraced his role as james s little brother , peered at him quizzically then the buzzer sounded , and james sat bolt upright two teammates reached down and pulled him to his feet , and he walked onto the court the game the series was done , james knew that and with that , he ran up the court
