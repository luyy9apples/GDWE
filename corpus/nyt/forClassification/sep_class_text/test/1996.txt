two rear cars of a manhattanbound no 6 train in the bronx were wrenched off the tracks early yesterday when a small chunk of a switching mechanism apparently broke off as the train changed from local to express tracks just south of the hunts point avenue station one of the cars crashed into a column beside the tracks , and the emergency braking system brought the entire train to a screeching halt , throwing some of the 30 passengers from their seats , officials with the new york city transit authority said officials said the two rear cars happened to be empty and only 10 riders from the other cars were injured , none seriously the emergency medical service reported that eight riders were taken to hospitals , where officials said they were treated for scrapes and bruises and released within hours the accident , which occurred at 2 39 am , stopped all no 6 trains to and from the bronx for the next three hours throughout the rest of the morning , stretches of the no 6 line in the bronx were out of service , and the nos 4 and 5 trains in manhattan were making local stops to compensate for missing no 6 trains but by yesterday afternoon , full service on the no 6 line had been restored , transit officials said they said it could take weeks , however , before metallurgical and other tests answer the question of why the switch , which was neither especially old nor subject to enormous stress , broke the officials characterized the incident as both uncommon and unforeseeable , and said it did not give them concern about the condition or safety of other switches in the subway system it s an extremely isolated incident , said john gaul , assistant chief transportation officer with the transit authority s subway department mr gaul inspected the scene of the accident yesterday afternoon stephen b dobrow , president of the committee for better transit , a citizens group that monitors mass transit in the new york region , said he was not alarmed and did not think the breaking of the switch was symptomatic of wider problems with the new york city subway system this kind of thing does n't happen too often , said mr dobrow , who teaches engineering at fairleigh dickinson university and it s very hard to catch in advance the train was being rerouted from local to express tracks because some unrelated repair work was being done on local tracks south of the hunts point avenue station the front of the train was only about 35 feet out of the station when it came to the switch , which was supposed to catch the train s wheels and steer them smoothly to the express track on the left the switch was correctly in place , transit officials said , as the first nine of the 10 cars on the train passed over it but as the wheels of the 10th car hit the switch , a pencillength chunk of steel apparently chipped off , and the wheels came off the tracks , pulling that car to the right as the rest of the train continued toward the left the ninth car was then jerked forcefully enough to the right that it too came off its tracks , hitting a column where the local and express tracks diverge neither car tipped over , and all the cars stayed linked , said joseph hofmann , senior vice president of the transit authority in charge of the subway system mr hofmann said a larger accident was averted by several factors the train s speed which was under the limit of 10 miles per hour at the switch point , the sturdy condition of the subway cars themselves and the limited number of people riding the train at the earlymorning hour of the accident mr hofmann said there would be no special inspection of switches throughout the system following the accident because the system s tracks and switches are inspected daily as it is we 're not going to panic about it , mr hofmann said we 're right now asking our engineers to look at whether there was any way to avoid it if it is found that there might have been some way , he said , the transit authority will look anew at other switches melissa farley , a spokeswoman for the transit authority , said that an initial inquiry showed that the switch was probably about 20 years old , which she said was not unusual moreover , it was used only sporadically , during portions of rush hour when the no 6 is rerouted from local to express tracks or at times , like yesterday , when repairs close local tracks after the accident , many new yorkers found their trips between the bronx and manhattan were complicated , even though the transit authority made up for some of the lost subway service with shuttle buses this is a disgrace , sputtered marco milete , 36 , of the pelham bay section of the bronx , who was heading to work in downtown manhattan around 1 20 pm yesterday when his no 6 train stopped at the hunts point avenue station , beyond which the detritus of the accident was blocking the tracks mr milete complained that no one at the start of the no 6 line had warned him diagram what happened chip causes crash

seattle , june 8 a few days ago , the choice was between paying more attention to either the potent triangle offense or that annoying hologram defense today , the decisions are easier for george karl and his team michael jordan will either draw a double or triple team gary payton will either be sipping a double or triple latte containment and caffeine , crucial elements for a series to break out and a coronation to be put on hold the seattle supersonics return home sunday , where they will try to keep david stern and the rest of america from yawning and the chicago bulls from moving within one game of postseason immortality with game 3 looming sunday at key arena and seattle trailing in the fourofsevengame series , two games to none , somebody needs to cut the sonics' slumber short it is not phil jackson s guys gary s fine , karl said , referring to concerns over payton s play in the first two games his point guard is 12 for 32 from the field , has nine assists and four turnovers in two games sure , he exchanged words with jordan in the final seconds of game 2 , a 9288 loss at the united center on friday , where he showed more animation than he has in three days and , yes , shawn kemp s persistence inside and seattle s lategame perseverance were encouraging signs for the sonics but as game 3 looms sunday , the difference between talking the talk and , well , taking a hike for the summer are abundantly clear the bulls execute better in the final minutes than anyone in the league the sonics , meanwhile , are still experiencing growing pains when it comes to maintaining their poise down the stretch we 've learned from these two losses , but we have n't gained that confidence that comes with winning a basketball game , karl said i think the one thing we 're learning is that it s going to take 48 minutes of serious , intense basketball i think in both games , we 've only given about 43 , 44 minutes kemp again carried the offensive load in game 2 , scoring 29 points to go along with his gamehigh 32 in game 1 the sonics battled back from a 13point deficit in the fourth quarter to climb within 3 points late in the game they held the bulls without a field goal the last six minutes of the game but could not convert themselves in the final minutes for the sonics to stop the bulls from climaxing this astonishing season on seattle s home floor , they will have to take two of three games from chicago over the next six days one victory , and jordan and friends would be sweepless in seattle two sonic losses , and the bulls emerge nearly unscathed in the playoffs they would go a stunning 151 in april , may and june , setting a league record for an nba champion hey , we could get three straight , you just do n't know , the seattle reserve swingman vincent askew said we just have to keep that one dude off the boards he works too hard for us to be playing around dennis rodman s line for the series 33 rebounds , 17 points and 9 hard fouls aside from the tiedyed hair and his adolescent antics after each layup he makes two inches from the rim , chicago s most prominent alternative player was the reason the bulls won game 2 his 11 offensive rebounds tied elvin hayes s finals record set in 1979 the worm squirmed , pushed , pulled and willed his way through mounds of muscle to get to a loose ball in the final seconds , with the sonics within 3 points it is that sort of desire and jordan s refusal to let his teammates get complacent at any time that is turning this championship series into a sleeper jordan pulled toni kukoc aside to let him know how fortunate he should feel to have an open look at the basket in game 2 i thought we were playing a really passive game , especially toni , jordan said he was very hesitant with the shot he was n't playing with aggression and i pulled him over to the side and asked him 'are you scared \? if you 're scared , then go sit down if you want to shoot the ball , then come out and shoot it do n't come out here to pass it' kukoc responded with his second straight outburst in the third quarter , scoring 8 points in little more than 90 seconds as the bulls opened a 13point cushion early in the fourth quarter want a scary thought \? chicago has yet to take full advantage of payton guarding pippen in the post we have n't exploited the pippen matchup , bulls coach phil jackson said he got 21 points with gary guarding him , the same as he got the the first night that s ok but we have n't been making a special effort to take him in the post or do anything unusual with that matchup payton and jordan traded ugly words with less than 10 seconds remaining in the game on friday , the first indication that the league s defensive player of the year had any inclination to turn offensive in the series ron harper finally restrained payton as he was almost nosetonose with jordan kemp came over and escorted his emotional teammate away it s just more conversation than anything , jordan said he s not guarding me and i'm not guarding him i think that s what everybody wants to see maybe we should play oneonone after the series is over we 're both mature enough to know that it should n't affect the way we perform he ca n't get in my head i'm pretty sure he s not going to let me in his head so it s a standoff right now that s what jordan has all the sonics thinking they 're good enough to compete , but not nearly great enough to overcome his bulls photo things got a little testy between gary payton and michael jordanduring the fourth quarter friday night jordan struggled , payton and the sonics lost \( photograph by michele agins the new york times \)
moscow , july 3 round midnight , while top yeltsin campaign aides remained huddled behind closed office doors in the heavily guarded presidential hotel , champagne and cognac bottles were already uncorked across the hall , where young campaign aides gathered to celebrate the early , promising returns as television sets blared out reports of president boris n yeltsin s early lead , the young ones laughed giddily and traded jokes built on oftrepeated campaign slogans in the hall , an older campaign worker drew heavily on a cigarette and searched for historical closure this was the communists' last chance , maksharip m yandeyev , a campaign adviser , said soberly ttey will never rise up again this is their final death throe across the city , in their shabby , makeshift election night headquarters , communist leaders sought to put their own spin on the voting mainly , they promised to fight on by other means the national patriotic bloc will keep its electorate and remain a weighty opposition force , said anatoly lukyanov , the elder statesman of the communist party we are looking calmly at the future because no power can afford to ignore this their somber , nofrills election night , held in the nearempty offices of spiritual heritage , a nationalist research foundation that supported mr zyuganov s candidacy , provided a stark contrast to the cheer and generous buffets at two different yeltsin headquarters at the presidential hotel , where visitors were allowed to enter only with a special pass , aides monitored the early returns , munched on room service sandwiches , and played computer solitaire behind closed doors at the offices of itartass , the russian news agency , government officials , foreign ambassadors and journalists preened for the television cameras and milled cheerfully , sipping wine , eating canapes , and gossiping serenely about the second term campaign aides complained of fatigue journalists , most of whom openly supported mr yeltsin s candidacy , were celebrating over champagne when the early results were announced on television , a russian reporter raised his fist in triumph but earlier in the evening , before the polls had closed all over russia , a ripple of anxiety went through the yeltsin camp the moscow bureau of cnn reported that according to their sources in the campaign , mr yeltsin was suffering from angina , a serious heart condition campaign aides at election headquarters quickly insisted that cnn had misheard or mistranslated its sources angina , in russian is a commonly used term for throat inflammation , or tonsillitis when mr yeltsin fell ill five days ago , and canceled all his public appearances , his aides said he was tired and had a bad sore throat last year , when mr yeltsin was hospitalized for a lengthy period , his aides admitted for the first time that he suffered from myocardial ischymia , a lack of oxygen to the heart caused by narrowed arteries they have steadfastly denied that mr yeltsin s current illness is linked to his heart condition they can say whatever stupid thing they want , sergei filatov , one of mr yeltsin s top camapign advisers , said tonight if a person has a heart problem he does n't sit in his dacha , he lies in the hospital but cnn stood by its intepretation of the word angina we 're not wrong on this , we 've confirmed it with several people , said one cnn producer they 're just trying to muddy the waters we 're not saying he s dying , but it s more than a sore throat as they filed into polling stations today , ordinary voters in moscow seemed mostly unaware of mr yeltsin s illness or unalarmed i 've heard gossip , rumors that it s his heart , said a 55yearold retired nurse who voted for mr yeltsin and who gave her name only as ludmilla but they say he s fine , and i have no doubts look , she added i or any of us could drop dead tomorrow other yeltsin supporters seemed to believe that mr yeltsin s illness could be serious , and shrugged even that off is he sick \? it s not evident , andrei petrov , 33 , said with a smile the owner of an advertising agency , mr petrov said he would vote for anybody rather than the communists life now could get ten times worse , he said grimly , and it still would be better than under the communists he said he was not perturbed at the thought that the president could be more seriously ill than is publicly acknowledged he smiled so what \? they say it s the court that makes the king the yeltsin team s greatest fear all along was a poor turnout they worried that their supporters , less disciplined than communists , would go to their weekend houses instead of the polls but valentina d goncharuk , 40 , a teacher and mother of two , traveled all the way back from her dacha today to vote for none of the above they are two equal evils , she said in 1991 our whole family was for yeltsin but after chechnya i have two 22yearold nephews how can i vote for this man now \? but i do n't want communism either , even though my family and i live in conditions close to poverty it s my protest , she added perhaps it s not such a smart thing to do , but i just cannot support either one photo with their candidate leading early returns , aides to presidentboris n yeltsin celebrated at their electionnight headquarters in moscow across town , the mood was more somber at the communists' nofrills gathering \( reuters \)
for nearly two years , southampton villag' officials worried that the long island rail road would knock down their historic station to accommodate an elevated platform when they saw the bulldozer a few weeks ago , some feared the worst when the work crew showed up , it was like a bitzkreig operation , said the village administrator , howard m mcelroy they were in a convoy of trucks and a bulldozer was behind them when the convoy stopped in front of an abandoned railroad freight building across the street from the sopthampton station , a passerby stopped and called village hall to ask what was going on this is a small village there are no secrets here the phone call caught village officials by surprise , he said , because the railroad had moved in without so much as a howdydoo the village building inspector and at least three village police officers raced to the scene and caught the work crew just as it was bringing the bulldozer up to the freight building at their insistence , work stopped and the crew left while village officials sought to determine what authority they had over railroad property it turned out they had none , mr mcelroy said , but he said the railroad should have notified the village of its plans just for good public relations he pointed out that the village mayor , douglas murtha , wrote to railroad officials in the spring of 1994 asking that he be kept informed of all their plans in the village mr murtha also mentioned his concern about rumors that the southampton station would be leveled when the elevated platform is erected the railroad wrote back promising to keep us informed , and that was the last we heard from them , mr mcelroy said the spation was erected in 1902 and a railroad historian , ronald p ziel of water mill , said it is regarded as one of the finest in the east coast because of its original architecture oyster shells embedded in stucco it also has a working fireplace , ' wooden bench in the waiting room with a curved armrest and real glass in the windows mr mcelroy said the station is something we want to preserve it s in the village s historic district , which shows how much we think of it , he said when i drive by with friends , they make me stop and give me a 'wow' when you walk inside , it s like walking into the past the station master s office has a rolltop desk just like an oldfashioned railroad office and there are telegraph instruments in the office , along with other memorabilia going way back the southampton station is one of 35 on the montauk , oyster bay and main lines that are slated to be outfitted with edevated platforms to accommodate a new fleet of diesel cars scheduled to begin arriving in 1997 , said susan mcgowan , an lirr spokeswoman the 40 million platformraising project would eliminate the need for steps on the diesel cars and thus make them accessible to the disabled , as required by federal law , she noted a total of 53 stations are currently accessible to the disabled out of 134 ms mcgowan confirmed that the railroad has decided to construct the elevated platform east of the southampton station in order to preserve it and she insisted that railroad officials would be meeting with village officials to discuss their plans but kevin mcdonald , vice president of the group for the south fork , a local environmental organization , said the railroad s plans were largely unknown and of concern to many communities along the south fork the concern lies in making certain that the towns in which the stations are located have sufficient involvement in the design and that the visual impact of the elevated platforms is minimized , he said we want these platforms to blend into the region s rural character in southampton there is an overhang at the station that stretches over the the entire platform are they going to remove it \? what is good for the massapequa park station poured concrete and aluminum railings may be perfect for people who are commuting back and forth to the city each day but there is a need to come to terms with some of the older stations that have character and charm and are in excess of 50 years old ms mcgowan said there were no plans to disturb the awning at the southampton station mr mcdonald said he was also concerned that some local officials might overlook the railroad s bid requests for platform work and then not have a chance to provide input we do n't want to hear from people after the fact who say , see what they did to the train station \? ' he said the need for elevated platforms , he insisted , should not be an excuse to suburbanize semirural settings mr ziel said that was inevitable because the railroad has to put up a cyclone fence apron to keep people from cpawling underneath the raised platform and the fence catches all kinds of garbage this is country out here , he said , and those platforms will make the railroad look like an extension of the new york city subway system community railrcads do n't have raised platforms that s something associated with the city and rapid transit
until a few years ago , there were several places in my town where you could go for coffee where you went depended on lots of factors , among them your age , income , political orientation and general outlook on life , as well as whether you smoked never mind who patronized which shops now that not one but two starbucks have settled into the landscape , everyone goes to them i do , and i gave up caffeine in 1980 \( although i relapse on occasion \) but i love the ritual of drinking coffee , as well as the flavor and the aroma of even decaf , and i'm drawn not only to what one does over coffee \( schmooze , dawdle , read magazines that advertise weekends in the pyrenees \) , but especially to the treats , the muffins and scones , the wedges of excessively buttery coffee cake typically served with it apparently i'm not the only one pleased to see coffee bars creeping over suburbia like kudzu the question is , are we happy that most of them are starbucks \? twentythree years after the first one opened in seattle , the company penetrated new jersey , opening its first store in ridgewood in 1994 and adding stores in 13 other towns since then by the end of 1996 , there will be 18 starbucks in new jersey , a figure that does n't include the cafes in various barnes noble bookstores and four nordstrom s department stores that serve only starbucks coffee our state currently has 15 more starbucks than mississippi , which has none , and about 90 fewer than california , which has surpassed even washington state we 're one of 22 states where the company sees a demand for its product coffee at about six times the price of what it costs to make it at home obviously the public is willing in three years , branches have opened \( in order of appearance \) in ridgewood , westfield , englewood , upper montclair , montclair , florham park , freehold , morristown , haddonfield , summit , old tappan , princeton , fort lee , red bank and edgewater and more are scheduled , in millburn , ramsey and wayne why is the question , and one i 've pondered in four weeks of eating , drinking and living starbucks the short version of my answer is that people go for the coffee , in spite of the food , to get not only wired but also connected the long version follows it s burned , one customer said i brew better coffee at home , said another , and i always see him in starbucks these opinions notwithstanding , a lot of people swear by the company s coffee , which they describe as hot and so rich it s practically creamy the foam and frillfree variety may not be the best single cup you 've ever tasted , they argue , but it s better than average , and consistently , which adds to its appeal as for the decaf , it only occasionally tastes like mud , and the managers are usually willing to brew a new urn even an hour before closing true , you can buy el pico at shoprite \( 429 for a 10ounce can \) , but it s not as wonderful when i brew it , nor is it 160 degrees fahrenheit , which , a company spokeswoman says , is the temperature of coffee at starbucks one reason both the regular coffee and decaf are so consistent , anyway , is that the company leaves nothing to chance employees , called partners in the groovy , feelgood language of new age capitalists \( and they are given stock options \) , are sent to regional centers that are the coffee equivalent of hamburger u they 're drilled in everything from tamping \( packing the espresso grounds \) to calling \( translating orders into baristaese \) your i 'll have an iced decaffeinated coffee with vanilla syrup and skim milk , please becomes an efficient iced decaf tall skim vanilla latte no wonder partners use crib sheets they err anyway , as do the people employed by the starbucks kitchens the caramel macchiato , for example , the latest novelty coffee , has that soupcon of paint thinner , and the caramel does terrible things to the foam it s bad , but not as bad as last year s notorious eggnog latte , soon to be resurrected more beloved among the various ccinos are the blended mixtures of espresso , milk , sugar , spices and ice it s october , and still people drink them detractors point to two related problems first , they 're too sweet , and second , they 're creating a new generation of addicts , children who drink them with their parents' blessing and why not \?

cairo abdelwahab had it all almost a poor shopkeeper who became one of egypt s richest men , he lived in a grand apartment in posh zamalek that was filled with gilded furniture he had a mercedes , an adoring wife and four daughters but the son whom he educated at egypt s most expensive university was giving him no end of trouble for a month , before a mesmerized television audience across the arabicspeaking world , abdelwahab jr fell in with company no upstanding egyptian would tolerate first he became an islamic militant then he was pursued and caught by an american seductress what would become of him and his family \? night after night during ramadan , the muslim holy month that is also the region s peak television viewing season , arabicspeaking viewers from cairo to canada tuned into the signals of the egyptian satellite channel , or esc , to find out if the wayward son would reconcile with his father and join the family business \( he did \) i will not live in my father s shadow is a quintessentially egyptian melodrama , the sort of programming that new satellite broadcasters hope to use to build their audiences and their businesses while private companies like the saudibacked middle eastern broadcasting center , or mbc , are going in search of the music and sports programming that brings western broadcasters big revenues , it is clear that the kind of strong arabiclanguage programming provided on the governmentowned esc is crucial to the success of these new businesses egyptian producers are well aware of this adapted from a short story by one of egypt s best novelists and starring two of its most popular actors , the monthlong esc serial was a smash hit insofar as one can tell in a country where ratings are a matter of rumor rather than nielsen research the serial , produced by the egyptian radio and television union , reinforced themes that the government likes to stress the possibility of social and economic mobility in this classridden society , the danger of militant islam and the need to resist foreign corruption of egyptian identity and values by stronger or wealthier powers using its satellite television to help its four million citizens abroad maintain a strong egyptian identity and continuing egypt s cultural dominance among the world s arabic speakers are two of esc s goals , amin bassiouny , president of ertu , said in a recent interview a third goal , in perpetually cashstarved egypt , is making money much of esc s programming resembles that of its rivals because , according to mr bassiouny , much of the programming broadcast by mbc and arab radio and television , or art , is egyptian a typical day s fare on esc begins with saba elkhair ya masr , an egyptian clone of good morning america , except for the koranic reading later comes hit parade , a mix of classical , egyptian easylistening and rock tunes , hosted by halla hashish , a comely disk jockey with no veil , a lot of hair and a sexy , if tightly buttoned , silk shirt like most other middle eastern satellite broadcasters , esc interrupts its programming for prayer time but only about 3 percent of esc s programming is religious , compared with 10 percent of the shows on art , which is based in italy and , like mbc , was founded by a consortium of saudi investors the 20minute afternoon news broadcast is invariably led off , as is the evening news broadcast , by whatever president hosni mubarak is doing that day some of the news footage is bought from cnn or euronews and dubbed into arabic following the news on one recent thursday came a howto program called the makeup show a seemingly odd choice , since egyptian women have specialized in this art since nefertiti the most popular features on esc are egyptian films , particularly those made during the 1940 s and 1950 s , egypt s golden age of cinema , and the soap operas that make as the world turns look sophoclean almost all of the arabic satellite stations show new egyptian films as well as quiz shows , music videos , and sports and like most of its competitors , esc is filled with pictures of women dancing , singing or discussing national affairs almost none of whom is veiled this reflects the government s desire to discourage hejab , or islamic head scarves , which in its view are often a sign of fundamentalist sympathies ertu , which employs more than 15 , 000 civil servants and has an annual budget of about 100 million , produces about 1 , 000 hours of programming a year and the government is expanding both its production and broadcasting capacity everyone must buy from us , said mr bassiouny egypt , he said , is to arab broadcasting what america is to action films there are no saudi films , he sniffed and the little that other countries produce uses egyptian directors , actors and technicians we were the first to use arabsat to transmit in 1990 , and neither mbc nor art could stay on the air without our programming there is no comparison between them and us you ca n't compare the origin with the shadow
lucknow , india , april 8 as the setting sun spread a golden hue over the wheatfields that embrace his ancestral village , ram ujagar yadav sat in a grove of eucalyptus trees and mused aloud about the votes that he and tens of millions of other poor , lowercaste indians will cast in the general election next month for now , mr yadav said the other day , he will await the emergence of what many around here know as the fiza , a sort of buzz that develops before the election many of india s 600 million villagers rely on it to reach a political consensus on who suits their interests best for whomsoever the fiza is good , we 'll vote for him , mr yadav said then , warming to his topic , the 35yearold farmer gave a clue when i went to the teahouse the other day , they said the fiza was for mulayam singh yadav so i suppose we 'll end up voting for mulayam singh the key to the politics of chedi purwa , mr yadav s hamlet of thatched , mudfaced homes about 50 miles from this capital of uttar pradesh state , is that all 25 families who live there , clustered about a single well , share the surname yadav , a signal of their station in the ancient social , economic and religious hierarchy known as caste the yadavs , a cowherding clan that remains mostly confined to working the fields and other manual labor , are squarely among what india calls the other backward castes uttar pradesh , in northern india , with a population of 146 million , is not only the most populous state , but it accounts for 85 seats in the 545seat lower house of parliament and is a crucible of the changes brewing in indian society and politics it was here in the late 1980 s that castebased political parties made the breakthrough in northern india that , with other factors , signaled a decline in the supremacy of the congress party , the political vehicle of the nehrus and the gandhis that ruled india for 43 of the 48 years since independence under pressure from politicians who lead parties that appeal to sectional interests based on region , religion and language , as well as caste , indian politics have become increasingly fragmented as a result , it has become more difficult with each election for the congress party to prolong its reign it is the only party ever to establish a truly national following that crossed almost all the fault lines of indian society for about 2 , 000 years , that society has been ordered by castes , into which , according to strict hindu doctrine , all hindus are born and die as much as 85 percent of the current population of 930 million falls outside the elite castes , and for them the system has been a suffocating one that has been a more or less absolute barrier to escaping the poverty characteristic of indian life but society is changing , and signs are that this vote , to be spread over three days between april 27 and may 7 , may mark a new watershed in the political emancipation of the lower castes nowhere is this more marked than in this vast , kidneyshaped state with a capital that folds around the southern rim of the himalayas and down onto the plains that flank hinduism s most sacred rivers , the ganges and the yamuna one of the most colorful standardbearers for the lowercaste assertiveness is mulayam singh yadav , 56 , a former teacher who leads the samajwadi , or socialist , party , which draws support from the other backward castes or more than 50 percent of the state s voters competing for lowercaste votes is the bahujan samaj , or majority people s party , led by kanshi ram , an erstwhile medical doctor whose support is drawn from the lowest caste , the socalled dalits , or untouchables , who account for about 22 percent of the state s electorate to some indians , the future of india as a nation is threatened by the rise of what is known here as casteism and communalism , terms that are codes for uppercaste hindu nationalist groups that draw their support by playing on antagonism toward india s 120 million muslims but to others , especially supporters of the new sectional parties , the new political alignments are an expression of ageold realities in india that were smothered , or at least disguised , by the allinclusive claims of the congress party in this view , the lowercaste parties that are remaking the state s political map mark a new chapter in indian democracy in which the havenots , including the 350 million people living in poverty , will finally have a proper claim on the country s resources it is a historical fact that india is socially divided , said ram sharan das , president of the samajwadi party , at the pillared colonial bungalow the party used for its headquarters in lucknow but india survives anyway , and it always will survive if current trends in india s leading opinion polls hold , the challenge from sectional parties will cause the congress party to fall well short of a majority in the election , possibly with as few as 170 or 180 seats signaling his own anxieties , the party s leader and the current prime minister , p v narasimha rao , has already begun to maneuver for the possibility that the congress party s only way to stay in power will be in a coalition with other groups this would include some , like the samajwadi party , that have been at the heart of the congress party s collapsing vote bank in key states like uttar pradesh

washington the best way to understand what the fighting between israel and the proiranian guerrillas in south lebanon is all about is to think of it like this israel is about to have an election \( may 29 \) and the whole middle east is trying to take part in the campaign those who cannot vote directly in the israeli election are trying to influence the outcome by tugging the israeli public in one direction or another , using either violence , rhetoric or diplomacy yes , israel is having an election and everyone wants to come hamas , hezbollah , iran , you name it middle east expert stephen p cohen notes that for decades the basic arab perception of israel was that it did n't matter who ruled , because , the arabs argued , both major parties in israel had the same basic attitude toward the plo and the occupied territories only their styles and language were different but that is no longer the case the arabs and iran understand very clearly that israel is now standing before a major choice there are real differences between labor and likud , and the arabs and iran want to shape that choice those arab states that , up to now , have been rather quiet about israel s massive retaliation against hezbollah , want to see shimon peres reelected , because they know he will keep the peace process alive iran and the radical arab and palestinian forces want to see likud party leader bibi netanyahu elected because they believe he will kill the peace process and keep the radical dreams of the muslim extremists alive the militant fundamentalists have not been able to cajole , pressure or persuade a single arab government to break existing relations with israel , so now they 're trying to get the israeli public to do it for them whether iran , hamas , hebzollah company will be successful in totally disillusioning the israeli people about peace depends on syria it depends on whether syria will give the militants room for troublemaking from lebanon , or whether syria instead will make them irrelevant , by standing up and showing that syria s commitment to peace is more than just a whisper in warren christopher s ear up to now the syrians have opted for troublemaking , and lots of it so much so that it s now safe to say that the clinton administration has completely misread syria syrian president hafez alassad has played the americans \( and israelis \) for fools the clinton administration s syria policy has been based on two assumptions the first was that president assad had made a strategic decision to make peace with israel , and all that remained was to work out the terms the second was that even if mr assad was slow in concluding peace , it was worth it for president clinton to go to damascus and pay court to him , and it was worth it for secretary christopher to visit damascus 17 times , because that would keep president assad sweet and insure that he would n't undercut the peace process through his proxies in the west bank , gaza and lebanon wrong mr assad not only balked at making progress with israel , but he allowed an islamic jihad spokesman in damascus to publicly take credit for a suicide bombing in jerusalem last month and he allowed hezbollah \( which cannot operate without the tacit approval of syria s 35 , 000 troops in lebanon \) to steadily increase its rocket attacks on northern israel until israel retaliated massively one only hopes that on mr christopher s 18th visit to damascus he finally explains to mr assad that if syria is not going to be part of the solution then the us will treat syria as part of the problem , no better than iran mr assad only wants to take responsibility for peace once he has all of his golan heights back on his own conditions until then , he tells the americans , he is not going to pay any price in terms of his relations with iran or hezbollah , by cracking down on them mr assad s position makes perfect sense what s crazy is that the us tolerates it it is true that only mr assad can turn off the fighting in lebanon , just as he allowed it to be turned on but what is n't true , what has never been true , is the naive american notion that mr assad will do it if we offer him enough pleasure , if we offer him enough inclusion in the peace process this is not about pleasure mr assad does not deal in carrots he deals in sticks this is about pain and it has been shocking to see the pain that has recently been inflicted on lebanese and israelis , but until mr assad starts feeling a dose of that pain none of it s going to end
between them , frank shorter , bill rodgers and alberto salazar possess one olympic gold medal in the marathon and seven victories in the new york city marathon but none of those triumphs have come since 1982 , when salazar won his third consecutive new york race and no american runners have followed the success of this trio in new york the rest of the world has gone forward and we 've gone backward , salazar said during a news conference yesterday to celebrate next month s 20th anniversary of the new york marathon s shift to a fiveborough race the surpassing success of east african , algerian and moroccan distance runners is no secret but , after a track record that bordered on domination in the 1970 s and early 1980 s , why has american longdistance running regressed \? american marathoners get sidetracked , salazar said they run a bunch of other races that they have no reason to run other than for the money if there was no money , they would n't run the races and would be working out shorter , the 1972 olympic marathon winner , said the agents are in control , not the athletes they 're convinced by someone that they do n't have to train hard and can race as often as the agents want them to shorter pointed to one current runner , adam goucher , at the university of colorado , as having a chance to succeed at the highest , longest racing levels if he does n't overrace , trains with good athletes and trains judiciously , he can do well , shorter said
the missing by andrew o'hagan 208 pp new york the new press 20 we are none of us safe in the world with this blunt and ominous statement , the scottish journalist andrew o'hagan opens the american edition of his ambitious investigation into the phenomenon of missing persons this unsettling book conflating journalism , personal reportage , sociology and philosophical inquiry is suffused with the hawthornean notion that at the edge of every village lies a dark forest , waiting to ensnare the unsuspecting events in the author s childhood he was born in glasgow in 1968 instilled in him a marked fascination with the missing his grandfather s disappearance at sea during world war ii , the serial murders of several local women and the abduction of a neighborhood boy left mr o'hagan with the pressing desire to know what happened , to attest to these interrupted lives and to confront the anxiety that comes with the realization that such grave misfortune can befall any one of us we live surrounded by missing things , forgotten lives and missing people , mr o'hagan writes , and only the visible can begin to speak of it they might begin by speaking of who they have been themselves dutifully adopting this formula , mr o'hagan devotes the first half of the missing to reflections on his own ordinary roman catholic childhood in one of glasgow s new towns , suburban settlements constructed during the radical makeover of that crimeridden , povertystricken city mr o'hagan s recollections , recounted in a genial , conversational style , are heartfelt , ruminative and engrossing not least of all for their eerie sense of apprehension and impending danger his family , like others eager for a new start , fled the inner city in the hope of escaping fear and violence but fear and violence swiftly followed with admirable frankness and a kind of horrified wonder , mr o'hagan ponders his own brief experiences with cruelty and its seductive power when he was 8 , he and a friend took to abusing a younger boy on their way to school it was just a few slaps at first , but it got worse it became difficult to see the difference between fun and brutality when another little boy , sandy davidson , vanished from the neighborhood , mr o'hagan , familiar in this childlike way with the meaning of evil , developed an intense fear that he too might disappear the second half of the book is a journalistic foray into the dark world of the missing , a world far bigger than one might suspect and more varied in nature \( according to the national center for missing and exploited children in virginia , mr o'hagan reports , last year in the united states there were more than half a million cases of throwaways , children under 16 who had been abandoned by their parents \) children are kidnapped by strangers some are exploited , some murdered teenagers flee unhappy family situations adults also go missing some are abducted , some step willfully out of one life and into another , without a word of explanation others , who suffer mental illness , accidentally wander away from their lives , leaving no trace mr o'hagan s investigation , concentrated chiefly in britain , includes wrenching interviews with the tortured friends and families of the missing as well as with runaways and social workers there are detailed explanations of police procedures revelations about the unreported missing studies of kidnapping cases , past and present , solved and unsolved and , finally , a long exploration of the celebrated case of a number of young women found buried in the backyard of frederick and rosemary west in gloucester mr o'hagan has approached the subject of missing persons from nearly every possible angle , bringing to light the daunting dimensions of a social problem too easily forgotten or ignored his interest lies not with the murderer but with the murdered , not with the kidnapper but with the kidnapped , as if by delving into the details of the victims' lives he might somehow undo their misfortune although the narrative is occasionally discursive and repetitive , and although the prose is pocked at times with moments of redundancy , the missing is a surprising , thoughtprovoking discourse on the vulnerability of human life at the end of the 20th century it offers stark and vital lessons about compassion and suffering , community and mistrust , and the nature of individual identity
dallas , april 27 on the football field , life could hardly be sweeter for the dallas cowboys winners of three of the last four super bowls , their logo among the most popular in all of sports , the cowboys are trying to restake their claim to the legendary title of america s team , earned in the 1970 s , their last period of national football league domination but off the field , partly in criminal courthouses in and around dallas but more broadly in the court of public opinion , the team and its brash owner , jerry jones , are waging a very different and less successful battle and while this fight may or may not sap the team s potency on game days this coming season , it is already chipping away at the cowboys' carefully cultivated public image and exacerbating the team s contentious relationship with the nfl as far back as last season , league officials had alerted the cowboys of their concerns about some players' potential offthefield problems , ranging from drugs to use of a private party house near the cowboys' training facility for liaisons with women no incident has been more devastating for the cowboys than the recent indictment of the team s superstar wide receiver , michael irvin , who will go on trial this summer for drug possession those charges stem from a march 4 incident in which the police in irving , tex , near dallas , said they found irvin and a former cowboy colleague in a motel room with cocaine , marijuana and two employees of a topless dance club who the hotel manager said were using the room for prostitution but irvin s indictment was obly the culmination of a string of incidents over the past few years involving cowboy players and drugs , alcohol or alleged mistreatment of women at least two players have pleaded guilty or no contest to driving while drunk , two others were suspended by the league last season for drug use , and there have been three cases of alleged sexual assault of women who worked at topless dance clubs and amid the literal wreckage of a few automobiles , the question hovers over valley ranch , the team s training facility in irving are the cowboys out of control \? or , as many here have suggested , has the same system that produced the dominant team of the 1990 s done so with an ethos of permissiveness that led to these problems \? jones , the oilandgas millionaire from arkansas who when he bought the team issued the dictum that there would be no substitute for winning , adamantly says that th' answer is no the cowboys' problems are no porse than those of other nfl teams , jones insists they just get more attention because the team has become a national phenomenon , a sort of new york yankees for the 1990 s jones is upset at what he sees as the unfair condemnation of the team s morals , perhaps most notably from the former education secretary and book of virtues author william bennett in fact , jones suggested with a touch of sadness in an interview friday at valley ranch , where five lombardi trophies adorn the halls and where the team opened its first minicamp for the 1996 season on friday , the problem may not be that the cowboys are letting the country down maybe the country is looking to tear down its heroes i saw a quote one time , jones said slowly it said , 'i turn to most of the paper to read of men s failures i go to the sports pages to read about their strivings and accomplishments' i think that we have now transcended and gone on over to the sports page as far as looking for the human failings that are certainly there and always will be there records of recklessness still , some of those failings are more than a little hard to ignore consider the cowboys' list of mishaps , criminal and otherwise two players were suspended by the nfl last year after testing positive for drugs cornerback clayton holmes for cocaine , and defensive lineman leon lett for marijuana they were the team s first such suspensions since 1989 erik williams , one of the league s premier offensive tackles , slammed his mercedes into a concrete wall at 3 am following a postgame victory party at a dance club in october 1994 and was lucky to have escaped death , police said he missed the rest of the season and pleaded no contest to a drunkendpiving charge a few months later he was in legal trouble again , charged with sexual assault of a 17yearold topless dancer the charges were dropped after williams reached an outofcourt settlement with the woman a backup wide receiver , cory fleming , pleaded guilty to a drunkendriving charge after he was arrested by dallas police in a 2 30 am incident just days before the 1995 season opener he s lucky this did n't happen last week , because he would n't be here if it had , the team s head coach , barry switzer , said the next day switzer s comments raised questions about how serious h' was about disciplining players involved in such infractions i ca n't afford to cut him right now without hurting the team , because we do n't have another receiver but he knows he s expendable the cowboys have also signed a freeagent linebacker , broderick thomas , who twice in the last year has been arrested on charges of unlawfully carrying a weapon and once , drunken driving other incidents have not made the criminal docket , but have drawn attention and criticism nonetheless
washington , nov 1 the swiss ambassador to the united states , concerned that his country s reputation could be harmed by the growing disputes over the unclaimed accounts of holocaust victims , offered assurances today that switzerland would give full restitution to anyone with a legitimate claim to get their money back the ambassador , carlo s f jagmetti , acknowledged in an interview that many holocaust survivors and heirs of those who died had been badly treated , though he attributed that to insensitive banking bureaucrats rather than any organized effort to conceal money placed in switzerland as world war ii broke out he said the swiss government was making new efforts to identify longdormant accounts and match them with claimants the rights of individuals and companies that had accounts were preserved , and will be preserved , mr jagmetti , a career diplomat , said this morning in his office but of course there is always a matter of proof people must have something to verify that they are rightful owners of the dormant accounts switzerland has come under mounting criticism particularly from the world jewish congress and from senator alfonse m d'amato for moving too slowly to uncover the accounts or disclose the swiss banking system s links to nazi germany earlier this week the world jewish congress said that after 2 , 000 inquiries and 1 , 000 formal claims , the swiss ombudsman appointed as a gobetween with the banks has returned not a cent he has rejected every claimant for a year , the congress said this is a cruel farce perpetuated on holocaust survivors by the swiss banking industry mr jagmetti disputed that view , saying , we have reached a national consensus that we want to establish the truth , and noting that the government had opened several inquiries legislation is pending to suspend switzerland s secrecy laws for five years so the inquiry commissions , including one headed by paul a volcker , the former chairman of the united states federal reserve bank , can audit the accounts and try to match them with claimants at a news conference earlier this week and again in the interview today , mr jagmetti disputed reports that the government had tapped the accounts to settle swiss businesses' claims arising from the communists' seizure of assets in eastern europe those claims were settled through later trade deals , he said mr jagmetti said about 200 , 000 was transferred to poland in two transactions , one in 1960 and another in 1975 , under a 1949 accord that gave poland title to some of the unclaimed accounts those accounts belonged to former residents of poland , many of whom were presumably rounded up later by the nazis in 1972 the swiss government directed its banks to make larger payments from the unclaimed accounts to jewish and swiss charities but he insisted that none of those actions would deprive legitimate claimants of full restitution you hear from these survivors their stories , he said , and i do not quarrel with those stories there must be truth in them he said banking officials had made psychological mistakes in dealing with the claimants , chiefly by demanding death certificates for those killed in the holocaust mr volcker s commission will begin with audits at switzerland s three largest banks mr jagmetti said that the commission s initial investigation should be complete by next summer , and that all banks will be reviewed by mid1998 it will not be an easy search many accounts were opened under fictitious names or in the names of third parties some account information is believed to have been destroyed and while the banks have vowed to cooperate , there are suspicions among some on the volcker commission that the banks may recoil when the investigation delves into any evidence that the banks failed in their legal duties to their depositors
service corporation international , its friendly but menacing offer for the loewen group inc rejected , brought a higher , hostile bid straight to loewen shareholders yesterday service corporation , the world s largest funeral home chain , raised its stock offer for its chief rival from 43 , to 45 a share , or more than 32 billion analysts , who had predicted that service corporation would make good on its threats , said the skirmishing had only just begun we still have a long way to go , said susan little , an analyst at raymond james associates my sense from investors is that they want something north of 50 while the odds might be against service corporation s offer succeeding directly , the company wants to prod loewen s feisty founder , ray l loewen , into talks in a statement , the houstonbased service corporation offered to pay more in a negotiated deal that would preserve favorable accounting treatment than in a hostile deal , which could reduce its reported profits for several years mr loewen , however , has said that even 52 would be too stingy the service corporation tender offer made for a tumultuous loewen group debut on the new york stock exchange today loewen , based near vancouver , british columbia , moved its united states shares from nasdaq mr loewen visited the stock exchange floor , met with analysts and rang the closing bell loewen closed down 9375 cents , to 41125 , on volume of nearly 17 million shares , about four times its average trading volume on nasdaq service corporation closed down 125 cents , to 2975 analysts said that loewen s share price had remained below service corporation s offers because the bid had only about an even chance of succeeding mr loewen remained upbeat despite refusing to say exactly how his company would respond it s been a celebration day for the loewen group on wall street , he said the first time a company listed on new york and had a hostile offer the same day the service corporation offer , he added , only gave loewen group a better chance to boast of its accomplishments service corporation s offer had conditions , including replacing a majority of loewen s board , overcoming the company s poison pill defenses and winning the 75 percent shareholder response necessary for a hostile takeover under canadian law a formidable obstacle , said m lynn detrick , an analyst with williams mackay jordan company of houston the loewen family controls 15 percent of the shares mr loewen has loudly and repeatedly said that his company can reward shareholders better without being taken over by service corporation , which is about three times the size analysts have noted that pressure from other major shareholders can sometimes cause the most resolute corporate chief to bend service corporation and loewen are also dragging their conflict into the courts , the regulatory agencies and the political domain loewen is hoping that antitrust objections will slow service corporation s advance the company has publicized inquiries from the federal trade commission on regions where the two companies' cemeteries and funeral homes overlap service corporation says that loewen group is out of line in bringing up antitrust issues in a complaint filed with the federal district court , service corporation says loewen is misleading shareholders the company says such statements as service corporation is trying to eliminate a competitor , which appeared in the financial post , a toronto newspaper , suggest that loewen has the power to make regulatory decisions and mr loewen only chuckled at the notion that service corporation would try to keep him from speaking his mind the ftc , having ordered loewen and especially service corporation to sell some funeral homes in other deals , said when service corporation made its sept 17 bid that it would probably come under the agency s review loewen has said that the florida attorney general is also investigating the deal and that other states are at least sniffing at it consumer advocates have also raised objections service corporation has said it would sell some funeral homes to meet antitrust rules yesterday , service corporation filed suit in a federal court in houston challenging loewen s right to block the deal on antitrust grounds and accusing loewen of making misleading statements loewen executives have said that the merger would affect not only consumers but also owners of funeral homes wanting the most competitive bidders when they sell service corporation also said yesterday that it would change its state of incorporation to delaware from texas , apparently to bring its bid under delaware s laws and courts service corporation executives , cautioned by their lawyers , had no further comment beyond a carefully worded news release that quoted none of them
pittsburgh , jan 13 someone placed a large placard on the snowcovered lawn near the driveway leading to the colts' training facility in indianapolis on thursday , proclaiming the team an 11point underdog to the steelers in sunday afternoon s american football conference championship game here at three rivers stadium some national football league coaches would have had the sign ripped down , so the players would n't have negative thoughts rattling around in their skulls before such an important game ted marchibroda is n't one of them i do n't know if i take offense to it , marchibroda said the only thing that s surprising to me is that we beat the best team in the national football league during the season and they were 133 and now we go on to the next ball game and we 're a larger underdog than what we were playing that team i do n't know what the logic is marchibroda should have quit trying to figure these things out two weeks ago when the colts beat san diego in the wildcard round what they did to kansas city last week did n't make sense either now , logic says the colts , who are 08 against the steelers at three rivers stadium , ca n't beat the steelers the colts are bucking even greater odds when you consider that only four wildcard teams have won the conference championship game to advance to the super bowl dallas \( 1975 \) , oakland \( 1980 \) , new england \( 1985 \) and buffalo \( 1992 \) the patriots are the only team to win three road games and the raiders are the only wildcard team to win a super bowl six teams that play in domed stadiums have made it to the conference championship games but none have won and made it to the super bowl the colts are bad history students and they laugh in the face of logic all of the things that people are saying has not affected our team , marchibroda said homefield advantage , playing away that we 're a dome team playing in cold weather our football team is there to play football we did n't know we were a dome team until we read it in the papers talk with any colts player and none of them spout mealymouthed bromides like , we 're just happy to be here the colts , in their hearts , truly believe they will win this gives us an opportunity to go to the super bowl , quarterback jim harbaugh said we 're 60 minutes away we 're loose we 're focused we 're ready to go and like a prize fighter in a big fight , we want to take our punches , take our shots when we get them harbaugh added i think there are guys that feed off the disrespect factor i do n't feel like i'm one of them it does n't really motivate me what s at stake and the opportunity and the rewards are so great at this point , that s plenty of motivation for me the steelers are highly motivated they advanced to the afc championship game against the chargers last year they entered that game so confident they would win that some players made plans to tape a celebratory music video the chargers pulled the plug on that this game reminds me a lot of last year s game , steelers safety carnell lake said everyone thought the chargers just fell into the playoffs the steelers were the favorites and lo and behold , we lost the game we took them for granted lesson learned \? the outcome of the game will determine that the steelers are the most talented team and best able to overcome mistakes the colts have very little margin for error you do n't see a lot of weaknesses when you watch them on film , harbaugh said of the steelers you realize that it s probably going to be a technique game for us the colts go into this game without their most dangerous running back , marshall faulk , who injured his knee on the first play from scrimmage in the firstround playoff game against the chargers but it has n't stopped the colts from running the ball the rookie zack crockett rushed for 147 yards against the chargers , and crockett and lamont warren helped the colts to another solid game running the football against the chiefs still , harbaugh is the most dangerous threat , because he sees the field clearly and he is mobile when he s running with the ball , he s not just running , pittsburgh coach bill cowher said he s running and always looking to find an open receiver the steelers also like to run and the colts linebackers are good at stopping it that would have meant trouble for steelers quarterback neil o 'donnell last season , because the pittsburgh offense was so heavily runoriented this year o 'donnell has more options , particularly when the steelers go to their fivereceiver set are the colts , who have 12 players who were n't born in 1971 when the franchise \( then in baltimore \) last played in a championship conference game , awestruck heading into a game that could land them in the super bowl \? i do n't think the magnitude of the game has overshadowed the game , harbaugh said now all he has to do is pull off another upset
dallas , oct 3 ask republican men in this stronghold of conservatism why they are voting for bob dole in november , and the odds are they will tell you first that bill clinton is a promisebreaking , policyshifting politician whose charm and sweet talk have cast a dangerous spell on much of america it is not that they think mr dole would not be a good president they think he would be it is just that the same passion they feel in explaining why they do not like and do not trust mr clinton eludes them in explaining why they prefer his opponent as the 1996 presidential campaign has unfolded , president clinton s persistent lead over mr dole in public opinion surveys has been defined , in part , by a growing number of women who say they prefer the president over mr dole poll after poll shows mr clinton has gained significant strength with female voters in the four years since he defeated president george bush but on the other side of the gender gap , many of the same polls measure something else a strong preference for mr dole over mr clinton among certain groups of men , like white men who are married and live in the suburbs in many cases , the polls show , mr dole is doing even better among these groups of men than mr bush did in 1992 with the presidential campaign lumbering into its final weeks , many men , particularly in a state like texas , are angry that mr clinton is doing so well in the polls , frustrated that mr dole has failed to catch fire with voters and baffled that so many americans do not seem to care about character these men may profoundly respect mr dole , but they do not seem to like him very much while it troubles them to admit it , they wish he could be a lot more exciting , like mr clinton , or better still , like ronald reagan in the family room of a house in an uppermiddleclass dallas suburb , seven white men stayed behind after a weekly 7 am bible study group with their sixthgrade sons to vent their lack of enthusiasm for mr dole is so great that it took 20 minutes before his name came up i wish you could put ronald reagan s head , when he was president , into bob dole s body , said gil sheehan , a 39yearold father of three who runs a small giftmanufacturing business ronald reagan said , 'hey , america , this is what i believe' i do n't know if it s his handlers or what , but bob dole comes off as wishywashy phil mabry , a 42yearold stockbroker and father of four , agreed , saying ronald reagan had vision jack kemp has vision hillary clinton has vision , although it s one i do n't agree with i do n't sense that from bob dole he s very qualified , but he has trouble articulating his message and that s what elects presidents while none of the men said his wife was supporting mr clinton , they are painfully aware that the polls show mr clinton has a 2to1 lead nationwide over mr dole among female voters even in texas , where the most recent democratic presidential candidate to carry the state was jimmy carter in 1976 , men and women are straining in opposite directions while 50 percent of texas men prefer mr dole , only 39 percent of the women do , according to a poll of 1 , 007 registered voters taken by blum weprin associates in september by contrast , 36 percent of texas men who were surveyed prefer mr clinton , while 46 percent of the women do the margin of sampling error for each sex was plus or minus 4 percentage points the men have little trouble explaining why some women do not find mr dole an attractive candidate grumpy old man , said frank bullock , a 41yearold real estate broker it s a nixonkennedy thing , mr mabry said the only time the group got excited about the republicans was when joseph p garrett , a 41yearold real estate developer and father of two , asked would you vote for elizabeth dole for president \? i 'd love it ! mr sheehan said she s one of the reasons i'm excited about bob dole i 'd love a kempelizabeth dole ticket , mr mabry said that s my ticket , mr bullock said even when mr sheehan tried to stop the group from fantasizing too much about a possible female president dole , he still could not stir much enthusiasm for her husband please do n't think bob dole does n't have a lot of vision , that we 'd rather have a woman , he said but you know , he does n't have a lot of vision the men and dozens of other middle and uppermiddleclass men interviewed throughout dallas acknowledge that the explanation for the malefemale gap is more complicated they cite the republican party s rigid opposition to abortion , which has polarized the party establishment in texas and alienated a large segment of republican female voters they say that mr clinton has inaccurately but cleverly managed to portray mr dole as a man who would rob old people of their medical benefits and take food away from poor children they think that some of the issues that mr dole has stressed , like the need for a stronger defense and a stronger business environment , do not automatically carry as much weight with women and in a state like texas , where the economy has thrived in the clinton presidency , mr dole s pledge of a 15 percent tax cut comes off sounding to both men and women more like a political ploy but the way mr dole looks and talks is what the men keep coming back to whether at an afternoon game of sixman football for sixth graders in the uppermiddleclass enclave of university park or in the hog house of the texas state fair i wish dole would come across as a more toughminded person , a person with more vigor , said grant stephenson , 52 , an executive recruiter , watching his son play football i do n't think it s the age thing it s his style bill clinton has so much charisma i do n't even know if a ronald reagan could beat him this year , mr stephenson said at the state fair , men talked more bluntly about why mr dole s inability to charm hurts his chances , particularly with women dole , well , he s old and ugly for one thing , said scooter brown , a 51yearold veterinarian , horsetrader and dole supporter as for mr clinton , mr brown added some women know about his past , but they do n't seem to care mr clinton s past , in republican circles here , is shorthand for accusations of marital infidelity that may not be much of a factor nationally but that are being used in texas as part of a broader attack on the president s character bill clinton is not a role model for our children or our nation , said david slaughter , 38 , the owner of a women s shoe company who was at the fair with his wife and children it s the immorality , it s whitewater , it s sex that sentiment was echoed at the fathers' morning meeting i have friends who run around on their wives , and it s nice to go hunting and fishing with them , said frank fleming , a 44yearold lawyer , but i would n't want them running my country recent polls in texas showed mr dole had a lead so slim over mr clinton that the race is considered a dead heat but mr dole s diehard supporters remain convinced that texans both male and female will not be swayed by the president s charm been there , said will ford hartnett , a lawyer and conservative member of the texas legislature i was the nerd my fiancee was always attracted to smooth talkers but the good guys always win in the end in the end i got her what counts is stability , loyalty , devotion , integrity bob dole s going to win texas hands down graph shifting support shows percentage of married men and women who support each candidate \( source new york times cbs news polls \) chart the big picture how all men and women differ politically shows political views of both men and women , based on the new york times cbs news poll \( pg 24 \)

the dictatorship of the communist party is maintained by recourse to every form of violence leon trotsky wrote that in 1924 , when he was a leader of the soviet party he knew he was a commander of party terrorism before and during the revolution until he became its victim , causing few to weep in the soviet union , and everywhere else a communist party came to power , violence was the bedrock of its power now the chinese communist party stays in power through the unceasing use of violence against its people torture , imprisonment and slave labor outside its borders , it used the ultimate violence of military invasion to occupy tibet and for the halfcentury since to massacre its people and civilization but as chinese missiles were dropping off taiwan the violence of international terrorism us china specialists were heard urging a policy that has never worked against any dictatorship , communist , fascist , theological or military persuasion unsupported by political , economic or military sanction rather than stigmatizing and sanctioning china , the united states should assist those on the mainland who are working to change things was one example michel oksenberg , a prominent academic on asia , wrote that in newsweek and identified those people many chinese leaders now in power let s state clearly what is rarely said and often covered up attitudes about dealing with dictatorships do not spring fullborn from the problem of the moment they germinate from personal background , political leanings , motivation , experience , and above all from beliefs about what is good or evil that is true of scholars , officials , businessmen and commentators like myself none are acting simply as reporters , trying to convey data and present cool analysis we are advocates for our visions of morality we believe one set of attitudes toward dictatorships to be moral and another evil we do not often say so , possibly for fear of being considered appeasementsoft or warmongerhard americans who advocate persuasion without penalty can speak for their values themselves mine come from the belief that all dictatorships are based on violence and therefore dangerous and despicable by instinct and experience i am not a noncommunist but an anti for me , the question becomes how can we use our economic and political pressure to weaken dictatorships the corollary is that even if we cannot drastically weaken them , it is a sin to enrich or empower them , synonyms really i will not buy anything made in china no dictatorship was ever wheedled out of violence the soviet union collapsed because of internal rot , economic isolation , increasing american military power preventing expansion of the empire , and dissidents heard abroad , with the help of america s lane kirklands president clinton did well in the crisis china manufactured out of fear of democracy on taiwan although beijing pointedly has not renounced future missile use but the overall clinton policy remains to exact no price for the indecencies inflicted on chinese and tibetans , and instead to encourage american businesses and officials to push trade with china , including its armed forces the policy has failed , except to strengthen the dictatorship short of war the us cannot destroy the dictatorship the chinese people will do that but the president can take steps that at least would not shamefully bolster it among them tying tariffs to proven elimination of torture and military action , against the people of china , tibet and taiwan prohibiting export of any us product or technology that would strengthen china s armed forces eliminating credit or guaranteed us loans for such suicidal trade \( during world war ii americans said sardonically that us scrap iron sold to japan was dropped on pearl harbor with china it s gone hightech \) invoking against china the severest penalties available by law for selling nuclearweapon material to pakistan or any country similar steps plus constancy helped end the soviet dictatorship they can bring closer the end of its chinese successor that goal is in the best interests of the people screaming in the torture cells , of america s security and its morality
correct me if i'm wrong here , but the way i remember it , the original christmas story was a quiet , lowbudget affair luke s rendition is almost matteroffact and it came to pass , in those days , that there went out a decree from caesar augustus , that all the world should be taxed i can understand why hollywood moguls might want to improve on this sort of flat storytelling taxes are interesting , but a downer you might get steve forbes in a lather , but you 'll never pack the multiplex even steve forbes ca n't pack the multiplex and steve forbes is rich joseph was a carpenter joseph was a man with so little chutzpah he could n't get his wife a room in the inn and she was pregnant you can bet mel gibson would have got mary that room even macaulay culkin manages to get himself into fabulous digs at the plaza in home alone 2 lost in new york , and he s only 12 plus macaulay culkin gets himself a limousine mary had to travel on a donkey so they had to jazz up the story broaden it each year they seem to jazz it up more , and broaden it more there s a trailer out now for jingle all the way in it , arnold schwarzenegger is shown leaping through the air at a toy display while the theme from chariots of fire plays in the background this is a christmas story jazzed as for broadened , new line cinema plans a christmas eve release of michael , a romantic comedy starring john travolta as an archangel that s right , john travolta as an archangel i remember when archangels used to scare people out of their wits not travolta he s described as an angel we can all believe in he smokes he s a regular guy only with wings remember luke s regular guy \? and lo , the angel of the lord came upon them , and the glory of the lord shone round about them and they were sore afraid they were poor shepherds tending their flocks they had no idea what a boon all this would be to the entertainment industry the cdrom reference guide cinemania 97 carries 48 films with christmas in the title christmas carol , a appears three times , in 1938 , 1951 and 1984 then there s the muppet christmas carol in 1992 scrooged \( 1988 \) is another telling of the same dickens story and if film makers can be traditional , they can also be bizarre a 1975 rrated horror film is called black christmas and concerns a murderer loose in a sorority house this is n't the half of it the initial list does n't include the christmas movies that do n't have christmas in the title it s a wonderful life , for instance , does n't have christmas in the title and yet it s a wonderful life is the christmas story that s lodged closest to the great beating heart of america pauline kael did n't like it , but even she called it frank capra s most relentless lumpinthethroat movie when robert c macfarlane tried to kill himself over the irancontra affair , during the reagan administration , he got his spirits back by watching and rewatching a video of it s a wonderful life the genius of jimmy stewart in this and other roles is not that he can be anybody but that anybody can imagine being him yet that movie s allure does seem to be generational i'm afraid my children relate more closely to jim carrey i have two boys , and it was a twoevening ordeal to get them to sit still for 129 wonderful minutes of jimmy stewart sure , they cried at the ending but not before they had both parents weeping with frustration soaring orchestras are n't enough anymore the kids expect soaring bodies too what they really like is national lampoon s christmas vacation it s the most rented of all the christmas movies , according to my local video store owner i watched it recently with my 7yearold son , andrew he shrieked with joy the moment chevy chase \( playing the suburban dad clark griswold \) climbed his aluminum extension ladder with his neverending string of christmas lights and his chrome staple gun he s going to staple himself to the roof , andrew said appreciatively sure enough , griswold did staple himself to the roof all was right with the world the holiday spirit is a wonderful thing griswold s fun oldfashioned family christmas may or may not be an accurate reflection of how most americans pass the holiday , but it does point out the almost inevitable juxtaposition of christmas with violence , comic or otherwise both home alone movies are set at christmas , and both portray macaulay culkin as a sort of oneman army parents organizations and critics alike were outraged by the violence done by this little boy but then again , christmas is frequently used as a foil in movies , a setup for a world about to blow even the passing shot of a christmas wreath can be a tipoff to tragedy , or action is a bomb about to go off \? is bruce willis in the neighborhood \? and yet hollywood still does crank out those quiet christmas movies , which try to accomplish with good will what is commonly done with car chases and plastique
washington , may 17 calling argument before the supreme court a form of art , chief justice william h rehnquist took on the role of critic today and offered appellate lawyers some pointed advice on how to argue a case lawyers appearing before the supreme court should know their case and know the court as well , the chief justice said at a lunch sponsored by an american bar association group , the appellate advocate institute lawyers with impressive titles or high rank who presume to argue a case without having done their homework appeared to be particular targets of the chief justice s displeasure , but he named no names it may be the attorney general of a state , the senior partner of a law firm , the head of some department , who has done none of the work on the case in the lower courts but who is either too busy or too slipshod to truly digest the brief from which he is arguing , chief justice rehnquist said , adding , this sort of insouciance offends the court and can do nothing but harm to the client s cause the chief justice said such a lack of preparation seems to me inexcusable , but it does happen on rare occasions noting that the justices read the briefs before the argument and have formed impressions of the case based on those briefs , the chief justice said that lawyers arguing before the court should be in almost entire agreement with their side s brief even if they did not write it themselves if the advocate takes a position different from that taken in the brief on any particular point , eyebrows will be raised and doubt cast upon both positions , he said chief justice rehnquist said it was also important for lawyers to understand the various uses the court makes of an argument session the advocate should realize that questions may be asked by members of the court for more than one reason , he said while justices may sometimes seek only to clear up a factual issue , he said , other questions may flow from less benign motives he added if your case involves a constitutional question , and your research shows that in recent decisions involving this same question the court has been split , you should assume that it is likely to be divided again you should also know from reading the recent decisions which of the present members of the court are apt to be sympathetic to your position , and which unsympathetic you should recognize that questions coming from members of the court whom you have reason to feel are unsympathetic to your position will not be designed to advance your cause , but will be more likely to be designed to expose perceived shortcomings or fallacies in your reasoning for that reason , the chief justice said , an advocate before our court should be extremely cautious about what he concedes , and about the way he answers questions , because with nine justices , a concession or answer that pleases one may displease another chief justice rehnquist recalled that when he argued for the first time before the arizona supreme court in 1954 , the members of the court asked no questions and sat through the argument like bumps on a log because their practice was not to read the briefs in advance by contrast , he said , justices of the united states supreme court come to the argument well prepared , and interrupt the lawyers repeatedly i hasten to add that this is a matter over which the chief justice has virtually no control , he said while chief justice rehnquist asks his share of questions from the bench , he is not one of the court s more aggressive questioners if i were to compare oral advocacy with brief writing , i would say that brief writing is the science , and oral argument is the art , he said careful preparation helps , but much of the actual performance must of necessity be all but spontaneous surely , this is one definition of art
baltimore , jan 26 the freshmen who marched into washington at the head of the republican revolution a year ago met here today for a midterm retreat , where they planned to lick their wounds from a year of battles and to gather strength for another charge at big government instead , they heard themselves lambasted by conservative hardliners , whose visions made even the sternest among them blink a year has gone by and almost none of the ambitious republican agenda has become law , speaker after speaker thundered this morning , as the freshmen and some sophomores listened , seemingly in shock others on the program said the republicans should never have relented on their strategy of forcing the federal government to shut down to force president clinton to accept the republican budget when you had the government down , you should have left it down , al dunlap , a conservative who is the chief executive of the scott paper company , told the republican lawmakers at a midmorning meeting the strategy was hurting republicans in the polls , mr dunlap acknowledged , but they still should have held fast no job is worth having that is n't worth losing for doing the right thing , he said while those who spoke at the retreat did not mention speaker newt gingrich by name , some of their anger was apparently directed at the speaker , who has deferred action on issues unpopular with many lawmakers but dear to the hearts of conservatives , like term limits about 50 of the 73 republican freshmen and 14 of the sophomores in the house arrived in baltimore on thursday evening for the twoday retreat , organized by two conservative groups , the heritage foundation , a research center , and empower america , a publicpolicy organization they brought in a number of conservatives , including william j bennett , the former education secretary and drug czar who is a founder of empower america edwin j feulner jr , president of the heritage foundation dr wade horn , director of the national fatherhood initiative , and ben wattenberg , the syndicated columnist and moderator of the weekly public television program think tank in many ways the experience for the freshmen was like a marine boot camp they were being ripped apart from the outset by toughtalking drill instructors , but left with the notion that they are invincible you have n't gone too far we 've barely done anything yet , mr bennett said in the keynote speech thursday night you 've just started this thing they will talk about how harsh you are and how mean you are , and you 've just got to hold your ground with democrats holding their own in the senate and mr clinton proving wilier than the republicans had anticipated , the heady times they enjoyed in the first 100 days of the 104th congress , when they began to enact their contract with america , has given way to near gloom during the budget battle a lot of people came in with unrealistic expectations on what could be accomplished , said representative phil english , a freshman from pennsylvania another freshman , representative rodney frelinghuysen of new jersey , said i think the class , over all , is still optimistic but the dose of reality is that i do n't think everybody understood how masterful the president is and how well he does on the pulpit the sponsors billed the event as an opportunity for the republican underclassmen to get away as a group from the rarefied political air of nearby washington to exchange ideas and reset their agenda beyond that , the gathering was an effort by conservative forces that are now fretting about the congressional leadership of senator bob dole and mr gingrich to jump start the conservative political revolution , with the underclassmen again providing the spark you have got to get a ceo who believes in you , said mr dunlap , the scott paper executive , and it s not bob dole bob dole is yesterday the senate is yesterday you are tomorrow representative dick armey of texas , the house majority leader who in recent weeks has come to rival mr gingrich as the conservative standardbearer among the freshmen , paid an unannounced visit to the gathering to deliver a brief pep talk , telling his troops not to be discouraged by recent setbacks think of it as a video tape you are watching , mr armey said , and the most powerful man in the world , the president of the united states , has his finger on the pause button but he ca n't hit the stop button together , the 73member freshman class and the 48 members of the sophomore class provide more than half of the 236 republican votes in the house of representatives a little more than a year ago , just after they were elected and before the 104th congress opened with its republican majority , the incoming freshmen gathered in the same place , the lord baltimore hotel , to hear some of the same speakers lay out the battle plan for the conservative revolution and to sing praise for the wave of eager new foot soldiers this year there was no escaping the somberness that hung over most of today s sessions i keep hearing how we failed and how we are getting beat up , said representative sam brownback , a freshman from kansas i do n't think we have sandwiched between a prayer breakfast this morning and a bus ride back to washington late this afternoon , the republican underclassmen attended public sessions on government downsizing , empowering citizens and strengthening america s families and culture at each public meeting , they got healthy dosages of advice before retreating to private caucuses to ingest it in what a member called quite candid discussions the underclassmen said that they did not expect to draw up a complete new agenda here , but they were clearly leaving baltimore with the intent of pushing their revolution onto battlefields that their leadership has so far avoided , including term limits i would encourage you to be far bolder than you have been , jim miller , a budget director in the reagan administration and now the counselor for citizens for a sound economy , told the lawmakers in the session on reducing government you have to cut back , cut back , cut back that monster mr dunlap caused the room to fall silent when he said the republicans should try to balance the federal budget immediately instead of over the seven years sought by their leadership you ought to do it in one year , said mr dunlap , who was described in his biographical sketch as rambo in pinstripes because of the way he cut costs and the staff at scott paper a sevenyear balanced budget will fail , he asserted in seven years the characters will change , the mood of the people will change photo republican freshmen and sophomores in the house gathered inbaltimore for a twoday conference on how to revive their conservative agenda they had plenty of reading material to keep them busy \( scott robinson for the new york times \)
with the underwater inquiry into the explosion of trans world airlines flight 800 failing to yield definitive answers about the cause of the crash , investigators say their best hope for a break in the case may lie above ground in the other , seldomdiscussed prong of their inquiry the hunt for human suspects it is a climate in which any gap in a person s biography or any abrupt change in personal or financial status is examined , no matter how seemingly incidental or farfetched veterans of previous cases say that under such scrutiny almost anyone including passengers , airport workers and others with access to the plane can seize investigators' attention federal agents have held off interviewing the grieving families of the 230 passengers and crew members who died when flight 800 broke apart after takeoff from kennedy international airport on july 17 but through their own record checks , and their inquiries into tips from landlords , friends and others , investigators have identified several potential suspects or targets of a bombing leads that have been examined and discounted just as investigators looking at the physical evidence started with theories about the cause of the crash and then began knocking them down one by one as parts were recovered from the ocean , their work on the human side of their investigation is not closing in on a theory so much as eliminating possibilities the process will intensify as the federal bureau of investigation conducts a thorough examination of the passengers while continuing to look at those with access to the plane investigators said they have already followed these trails without coming any closer to real clues they have taken a closer look at an algerian passenger identified on twa s list only by his last name the 1985 explosion of an airindia flight off the coast of ireland was traced to a bomb packed in a suitcase that was checked by a mr singh , someone who never boarded the flight checked out the personal life of a new york city flight attendant who was estranged from her husband and who had a generous life insurance policy questioned associates of a sri lankan airport employee with a background in chemical engineering who tried and failed to get a job with twa shortly before the crash , and who quit his job and abruptly moved to angola a few days after the explosion investigators say that not one of these people is now viewed as a potential suspect or target of a bomb attack but the scope of the investigation is no more focused could someone on the plane s previous flight from athens to new york have hidden explosives in a seat cushion \? was a passenger the victim of an insurance scam , an enemy or an estranged spouse \? the process of closely studying the backgrounds of passengers and others is part of every investigation into terrorist bombings of commercial jetliners after the 1988 bombing of pan am flight 103 over lockerbie , scotland , investigators chased down dozens of innocent details from passengers' lives that , when viewed suspiciously , made them seem like plausible suspects or targets almost everyone on the plane , almost everyone you ever met , has something that can get your imagination going , said an fbi agent who worked on the flight 103 case and who spoke on condition of anonymity a recent fight , a divorce , a business deal , an overseas connection when you do n't know what you 're looking for , it s easy to see all kinds of possibilities in the end , no suspicions were confirmed a federal indictment charges that the bomb had been in a bag checked by a terrorist who never boarded the plane in the pan am case , the agents' task was eased when forensic experts determined that the blast occurred in a specific cargo bin containing checked luggage belonging to a small number of passengers those investigating the twa crash have no such advantage the debris from flight 800 was spread over a mileslong stretch of ocean off long island i have great sympathy for the people running this investigation , said morris d busby , who was the coordinator of counterterrorism for the state department during the flight 103 investigation right now , the investigation is by nature unfocused , and until they find a forensic clue they 're going to have to run down every lead no matter where it takes them investigators have not declared that flight 800 was brought down by a bomb , but that is their leading theory they have so far been able to determine that the explosion did not occur in the cargo hold , the cockpit or the galley and now suspect it occurred in or under a passenger s seat or in a bathroom , food cart or overhead luggage bin the search for possible human clues is in its earliest phases but already , agents have searched the jail cell and telephone records of ramzi ahmed yousef , the man the fbi calls the mastermind of the world trade center bombing , who is on trial on charges that he planned to bomb united states airliners in asia
washington , jan 30 iran has increased its military power in the persian gulf in the last year , most recently by testing a new chinese cruise missile fired from a ship , senior pentagon officials said today along with sea mines , two soviet attack submarines , five chinese patrol boats and landbased missiles , the new weapon could increase iran s ability to try to close the strait of hormuz the gateway to the persian gulf and its oil in times of tension or war none of the officials said iran s test of the chinesebuilt cruise missile in the northern arabian sea on jan 6 was a significant challenge the test does not make them a major threat to our naval forces or to commercial shipping in the area , said the pentagon s chief spokesman , ken bacon but vice adm scott redd , who commands united states naval forces in the region , said today that the test signified a new dimension to military strategy in the gulf admiral redd said the missile , called the c802 , was about as powerful as the exocet , fired by iraq in its 1987 attack on the frigate stark , killing 37 americans the chinese cruise missile flies closer to the ocean s surface than the exocet and is harder for radar to detect the test of the missile , which was fired from a iranian patrol boat and monitored by a british ship and by united states intelligence satellites , took several days and was not completely successful , military and intelligence officials said but the fact that iran can place a cruise missile with a 60mile range on a boat allows the missiles to come at you from any direction , not just a fixed position on land , said comdr t mccreary , a spokesman for the fifth fleet , based in bahrain tracking mobile missiles , as allied forces learned in the gulf war , is nearly impossible it s not overwhelming , but it is now just one more thing in the iranians' bag of tricks , commander mccreary said as you add them all together it makes the job a lot tougher still , we certainly can deal with the threat military and intelligence officials said the deployment of the missile did not mean it would be fired in anger but they said it was hard to tell what iran was up to on any front , military or political , given a lack of hard information from inside its ruling councils it s much more difficult for us to gauge intentions than it is to gauge capabilities , said mr bacon , the pentagon spokesman we do n't know where they 're going we do n't know what their intentions are iran is no superpower it has enormous military and economic problems left over from its long war with iraq , which went on from 1981 to 1988 and cost hundreds of thousands of lives while china and russia still sell arms to iran , efforts by the united states to impose an arms embargo have cut overall weapons sales to the iranian government to about a third of what they were in 1992 , several military experts say nevertheless , given recent history , the united states will maintain a strong force that s able to deal with any contingency in the gulf , mr bacon said ever since the 1991 gulf war , the united states has been building its military presence in the region more than 20 , 000 american troops are in or near the gulf tanks and heavy armor for 5 , 000 soldiers are stored in kuwait mr bacon said the united states had seen no sharp increase in the threat posed in recent months from its other major nemesis in the region , iraq military cargo ships carrying arms for 20 , 000 soldiers were sent to the gulf in august from the indian ocean island of diego garcia and elsewhere in the region , he said

the positive spin of your feb 11 article , multicultural education immersion lesson for students , disguises some very troubling aspects of this movement for starters , solicitude for immigrant or minority students is nowhere near as new as the article implies it was present during the last major wave of massive immigration in the early 20th century , while teaching various perspectives has a long tradition in american education the multiculturalist proponents tout the importance of learning of differing points of view no problem there the danger lies in pretending that all points of view are of equal significance or validity in particular , the multiculturalists suppress or deny the reality of an american point of view their programs presume only a variety of perspectives determined by group identity consequently , the reality of the american experience , which heretofore has assimilated immigrant populations and americanized them with recognition for variation in degree is rejected it is precisely this type of groupthink which has led to the implementation of the ethnoracial quota system so despised by the majority of americans most strikingly , none of the various educational and multiculturalist experts cited in the article demonstrates any concern to inculcate american history and heritage in immigrant children in order to aid in their assimilation of american culture on the contrary , the multiculturalist approach encourages immigrants to maintain their foreign traditions rather than adopting to american norms the local multiculturalists , and their many allies nationwide , have flipped the traditional assumption that immigrants should adjust to the american condition in its place they propose , implicitly or explicitly , that americans adjust to them a prescription for national suicide unique in world history totally missing from the quoted statements of long island s multiculturalist advocates , and this seems standard with such people , is any comprehension that such a thing as american culture , or nationhood , exists the socalled celebration of diversity typically results in a stifling or diminution of the american heritage the different programs , increasingly mandated , which emphasize multicultural minority interests , reduce or exclude the historical cultural heritage of the majority of american citizens and their children this is the surest way to generate the resentments which the multiculturalist programs purportedly diminish richard f welch woodbury
kevin was busier than one of santa s elves this holiday season not only did he drop hundreds of dollars on presents , he also spent hours stashing them in outoftheway places days before christmas , two books , each wrapped in expensive paper , were nestled beneath his bed a pricey jacket for his girlfriend was tucked among the socks and underwear in his chest of drawers a closet full of fancy clothes concealed an expensive knife sharpener , snapped up weeks before in a sale though hiding gifts before christmas is common , kevin keeps some hidden yearround you see , his girlfriend has told him that if he does not stop buying things , she will leave him kevin , who earns 15 , 000 a year as an adviser in a mental health center in iowa , says he just cannot stop buying things from magazine subscriptions to household appliances the knife sharpener , for example , still has no intended recipient and remains buried in the closet after the holiday in two years , he has racked up 16 , 000 in creditcard debt i can go for a little more than a week without hitting the stores , but then i get tense for some reason , said kevin , 38 , who spoke on the condition that his full name not be used christmas shopping it s really hard to control myself , because i have an excuse to shop easy as it is to exceed one s budget during the holidays , compulsive buyers like kevin face that temptation with weakened defenses some leading psychologists estimate that five million americans , or about 2 percent of the population , are compulsive buyers but that estimate may be conservative a recent study by the university of minnesota found that 2 to 8 percent of the population suffers from the problem while compulsive buying can wreck one s finances any time of year , it is especially treacherous during the holidays compulsive spenders tend to be grand champion christmas givers , showering their loved ones with expensive goods that would make even donald trump smile most compulsive spenders are people pleasers , said janet damon , a manhattan psychoanalyst who specializes in compulsive disorders when a compulsive spender buys gifts , he s trying to buy love and power this is n't really about money it s about the feelings of anxiety they are trying to relieve through the spending barbara , a 47yearold management consultant in los angeles , concedes that she has a spending problem and says she recently succumbed to an urge to go christmas shopping , spending 15 times more than she had planned when i buy these presents , i feel so powerful and so generous , she said like kevin and others interviewed for this article , she spoke on the condition that she not be fully identified once they recognize their problem , some compulsive shoppers seek help , either at the insistence of others or at the point of financial collapse they may try private therapy or credit counseling sometimes at the prodding of a bankruptcy court kevin and barbara are two of many who have joined debtors anonymous , a 12step selfhelp group that is modeled on alcoholics anonymous the program encourages members to shed their credit cards and to adopt a strict spending plan that focuses on realistic needs founded in 1976 in new york city , debtors anonymous now has more than 400 groups worldwide some chapters hold extra meetings to help their members cope during the winter holidays and there is always information available from the group \( 212 6428220 \) of course , giving in to an occasional splurge does not make a person a compulsive shopper who among us has not overspent sometime \? maybe it was a 500 armani suit at saks fifth avenue that was just too good a deal to pass up , or , this holiday season , a tickle me elmo doll that little susie had her heart set on , even though the going price had escalated to 500 on the internet nor is it just handling money poorly that distinguishes a compulsive spender plenty of people could benefit from instituting a budget and from some financial education but compulsive spenders tend to exhibit serious emotional problems as well as financial problems , psychologists say people who ca n't handle money well have a skill deficit , said dr jerrold pollak , a psychologist with the psychiatry department at rhode island hospital in providence compulsive spenders ca n't control the urge to buy , and they may also suffer from depression or anxiety with it holiday buying sprees merely exacerbate problems for compulsive buyers they spend heavily yearround , no matter what their budgets will bear and no matter what it does to their family finances some go on periodic buying binges and some shop every day they most often pay on credit compulsive spenders usually carry more than 10 charge cards , psychologists say , creating a debt load that can quickly swell into six figures like many compulsions , the spending habit often starts at a young age according to the study by the university of minnesota , the typical compulsive buyer started as a teenager but did not recognize the full magnitude of the problem until 10 years later
two weeks ago , new jersey s first museum devoted to civil war memorabilia opened its doors its exhibits do n't recount the history of battles that took place in the state there were none instead , they focus on the lives of soldiers and the families they left behind at home later this year , the museum plans to add exhibits about africanamericans in the civil war period , particularly their role as soldiers it also has artifacts from leni lenape indians who lived in new jersey the civil war and native american museum , open saturdays and sundays from noon to 5 pm , is in a sevenroom house once used by tenants on a farm owned by john abbott 2d in veterans park in hamilton township vincent c mercandetti , president of the camp olden civil war round table , recently talked about the museum , which his group operates q what does the civil war museum have that is special \? a we have a confederate read shell fired at the battle of chancellorsville , and we have a us 38 inch caliber tiering base james shell , one of three in existence , and ours is in the best condition we have a civil war shell of the type and caliber fired by the swamp angel , one of the few named cannons used to fire on charleston from its marsh battery in the swamps nearly five miles from the city but we want to focus on the common soldier and the women and children who remained at home , both in new jersey and elsewhere we have a cavalry uniform that is in excellent shape of hanford h sortore of cranbury , who was in the 5th new york cavalry a lot of new jersey residents joined new york and pennsylvania regiments we have a lot of personal items of marcus stults of cranbury , who was a first lieutenant in company h of the 14th new jersey volunteer infantry , and we have a flag that flew over cranbury during the civil war we hope to have rotating exhibits of articles used by new jersey soldiers we have diaries , spectacles , a clay pipe , family bibles , clothing , thimbles , a fish sinker made from a bullet , pens and service records most of the artifacts we have are from union soldiers , even though many new jerseyans had strong southern leanings q what was camp olden \? a camp olden was the first major training camp for union soldiers in new jersey in the civil war , but for many years the location of its site was elusive one of the projects our organization did was to locate where it had been , which was where hamilton avenue and liberty street meet this camp was the training ground for the first 9 , 000 new jersey troops who were trained there as threeyear volunteers between may 24 and dec 4 , 1861 those men went on to fight in 27 major battles and many minor ones , and they suffered hundreds of casualties there were 80 , 000 soldiers from new jersey , and 6 , 200 of them died in battle , and tens of thousands of them were wounded q why is there such fascination with the civil war \? the poet walt whitman called it a strange , sad war the issues raised then have not been resolved yet race , states' rights , the perceived oppressiveness of the federal government the fascination exists in the poignant nature of the way fathers led battles against their sons and brothers against each other american schools and churches were burned as american towns were destroyed this was the first war photographed , and the first where the common soldier was literate enough that he could write home about it there is also the incredible cost in human life 620 , 000 people , or 2 percent of the population you would need to have a war that killed 5 , 000 , 000 americans now to equal it in impact karen demasters photo the civil war museum has a shell like those fired by the swamp angel cannon a diorama shows the action \( sam d'amico for the new york times \)
baton rouge , la it had been only the second game of the season , last sept 14 , but southern university , the defending black college football champion , had lost unexpectedly for the second straight time , to alabama state , 1614 the players , carrying their helmets , their jerseys disheveled , walked dejectedly away from the night lights of their home field , mumford stadium , toward the locker room suddenly a man jumped out from the crowd that had assembled near the gate and confronted southern s starting quarterback , a freshman you do n't deserve to be wearing this uniform , white boy , the man shouted into marcus jacoby s face you 're a disgrace you better watch your back before jacoby could react , some of his teammates and coaches did , jumping between the player and the fan they moved on , several of them creating a phalanx around jacoby afterward , when jacoby had dressed , a police officer , upon request of the head coach , pete richardson , escorted the player from the locker room to jacoby s jeep cherokee in the parking lot nothing else happened well , not quite nothing else with jacoby still at quarterback , the first white quarterback in the 76year existence of the historically black school , southern began to improve , finishing with a 74 record southern twice upset the teams that had been ranked no 1 among black colleges this season , florida am and jackson state , and on tuesday will meet howard university in the heritage bowl in the georgia dome in atlanta if it had n't been for marcus , said richardson , we would never have done this well he s a hard worker , and a tough kid jacoby was more than that , to be sure his role of starting quarterback , a traditional leadership position , touched off a debate on southern university s modest campus and beyond questions were raised about the mission of historically black schools and the types of students these schools should recruit beyond that , the experiences of jacoby and grambling s michael kornblau , another white quarterback at a predominantly black school , provide a fresh look at racial stereotypes that persist in athletics at 6 feet , 190 pounds , jacoby , a 20yearold with short blond hair and brown eyes , is not big as quarterbacks often go lionel \( skeeter \) hayes , whom jacoby beat out for starting quarterback , is 63 , 210 pounds but jacoby is resilient and , one of his coaches said , so highly motivated that he sees him becoming a football coach himself one day i do n't think that guy who jumped out at me was so mad about me being the white quarterback as he was that we had lost two in a row , said jacoby did i think about his threat \? sure , but i saw him as a trash drunk he did n't represent to me the kind of people that i 've mostly met at southern they 're really classy i truly did n't think i had anything to worry about , other than my drive to get the team on a winning track again and none of it seemed to come easy in one game , against tennessee state , an opposing player at the bottom of a pileup snarled to him , we 're gonna get you , opie \( opie was the little white boy on the andy griffith show \) jermaine brown , a sophomore wide receiver for southern , said , marc has taken hits in games that i do n't think i could have got up from i remember against alcorn state he was hit so hard they knocked off his helmet and shoulder pads in fact , three times jacoby has gone to the hospital after games to be treated for mild concussions that s part of the game , he said funny thing is , early in the season some reporter asked me if my offensive line was not trying that hard to make me look bad because i'm white what a question ! these guys are all on scholarship we all want to win can you imagine those guys risking their scholarships and their reputations for something that stupid \? did n't happen two losses bring criticism of his play after the second game , in which a jacoby pass had been intercepted at a critical juncture and he was generally playing tentatively , a letter to the editor by marlon j reed , a student , appeared in the school newspaper , the southern digest it set off a heated controversy reed wrote that historically black universities should recruit their own for such positions as quarterback he said that there were africanamerican athletes who could have received jacoby s scholarship shortly after , in an editorial in the baton rouge advocate , written by edward pratt , an alumnus of southern , pratt responded and wrote that he had heard that sentiment expressed by reed in the stands and on the street i think it is racist and wrongheaded , pratt wrote had a white columnist said that about lsu s africanamerican quarterback herb tyler , that person certainly would have been branded a racist the naacp and other civil rights organizations would have been quick to retaliate to the writer and his supporters , here is some food for thought what if major college and professional programs still held their racist positions that black athletes were not smart enough to play positions that require quick decisionmaking like quarterback \? or center \? or middle linebacker \? meanwhile , jacoby s success or failure as quarterback should be measured by his physical and mental ability and whether he gets the job done nothing else
smoking may cause a fourfold increase in some women s risk of developing breast cancer after menopause , researchers are reporting today the findings apply to women who carry genes that interfere with their ability to break down certain chemicals in cigarette smoke that are known to cause cancer the chemicals may then build up in their bodies , and set off the growth of tumors the study being reported was done on white women , more than half of whom carry these genes among other ethnic and racial groups , the frequency of the genes varies ten percent to 20 percent of people of asian descent have these genes , 35 percent of blacks and 65 percent to 90 percent of those of middle east origin by focusing on individual differences in sensitivity to cancercausing chemicals , the study takes a new approach to a question that has consistently evaded resolution a substantial body of earlier research has failed to establish any link between smoking and breast cancer although a swiss study published last may did report a connection , 20 previous studies had shown either weak links or none at all those studies , however , did not take into account the possibility that some women , because of their genetic makeup , might be more susceptible than others to carcinogens the new study , published today in the journal of the american medical association , is regarded by scientists as an important step , but they also caution , as do the authors themselves , that it is the first work of its kind , on a relatively small number of subjects , and must be repeated to determine whether it is valid asked to comment on the study , dr eugenia calle , director of analytic epidemiology at the american cancer society , said , the study is provocative , but it is much too early to say it s definitive she said that an increase in risk as big as that found in the study should have shown up in other studies as well , even if they did not consider genetic differences among women the fact that you do n't see it makes me cautious about thinking the association is really there , she said i assume others will try to replicate the work but dr calle added that the approach taken in this study , of considering genetic susceptibility to carcinogens , was an extremely important direction for future cancer research this kind of work can help us try to look at the interaction of genetics and environmental exposures , and define more closely what true risk factors are , she said dr john minna , a cancer researcher at the university of texas southwestern medical center in dallas , said the study was a reminder that we 're all predisposed genetically to something the research was done by a team from the national center for toxicological research , the national cancer institute and the state university of new york at buffalo the researchers studied 304 white women who had breast cancer and 327 who did not they surveyed the women s smoking habits and gave them genetic tests to determine which version they carried of a gene known as nat2 that gene enables the body to make an enzyme that breaks down certain toxic chemicals , including a class of carcinogens known as aromatic amines , which are found in cigarette smoke but 55 percent of all white people carry a version of the gene that yields a defective enzyme that cannot break down chemicals efficiently those people , referred to slow acetylators , are thought to be at increased risk for bladder cancer , especially if they are exposed to aromatic amines smoking has been linked to bladder cancer although the condition can be detected easily with an inexpensive laboratory test , testing is not widely available simply being a slow acetylator does not increase the risk of breast cancer but because aromatic amines have been shown to cause genetic damage in human breast cells , and mammary tumors in laboratory animals , the researchers suspected that slow acetylators who also smoked might have an increased risks their suspicion turned out to be correct , though only in postmenopausal women in that group , slow acetylators who smoked from threequarters of a pack to one pack of cigarettes a day had 32 times the breast cancer risk of nonsmokers smoking more than a pack a day increased the risk to 44 \( lung cancer risk , by contrast , is increased from 10 to 25 times among smokers , depending on how much they smoke \) no increase in breast cancer was found in premenopausal women or rapid acetylators who smoked it was not clear why the effect should appear only after menopause , but most breast cancers do develop then , and the researchers suggested that in some of the younger women , not enough time had passed for tumors to develop and younger women who did have breast cancer may have developed it because of risk factors other than smoking the more heavily a woman with slow acetylator genes smoked , and the earlier she had started , the worse was her risk , the researchers reported , adding that those factors were more important than the number of years she had smoked if these data are confirmed , the strongest public health impact will be in showing how important it is for young girls not to start smoking , said dr christine ambrosone , a director of the study who is an epidemiologist at the national center for toxicological research in jefferson , ark they are smoking at an alarming rate , more than boys , and we think that developing breast tissue may be more vulnerable to carcinogens early smoking may carry the greatest risk
new york , feb 10 when mayor rudolph w giuliani and fire officials first proposed shutting down new york city s fire alarm boxes more than a year ago , they said it would reduce false alarms and save 5 million a year new yorkers , they added , would be better served by the city s modern , expansive telephone system than by its antiquated network of 16 , 300 alarm boxes but a survey by the new york times , covering more than 450 public telephones in 15 city neighborhoods from jan 23 to feb 2 , found that nearly onethird were broken in addition , on many residential streets outside manhattan , anyone running to find a public phone to report a fire would find that there are n't any these findings raise serious questions about whether public telephones would be an adequate substitute for the fire alarm boxes scattered throughout the city problems with pay phones were found in poor , middleclass and affluent neighborhoods on walton and gerard avenues in the morrisania section of the bronx , for example , 42 percent of the sidewalk pay phones that were tested did not work at all on 48th avenue in sunnyside , queens , 36 percent of the phones were broken , as were 39 percent of those tested on ninth avenue in midtown manhattan along the east side of broadway between 66th and 72d streets on manhattan s upper west side , 7 of 11 phones were out of order one afternoon in all , 136 of 461 public telephones tested , or 30 percent , did not work properly they were either physically damaged , lacked a dial tone or failed to connect when a number was dialed many critics of the fire department s plan said the results confirmed their suspicions that pay phones were not a reliable substitute for alarm boxes i think what this shows is that if you deactivate the boxes , it is really unlikely that the level of fire protection will be as good , said councilman sheldon s leffler , a democrat of queens , who is chairman of the public safety committee he sponsored a bill last year that blocked the fire department from unilaterally dismantling the entire alarm system but fire commissioner howard safir challenged the idea that the reliability of public telephones was an essential element in his plan to remove the alarm boxes most of our calls do n't come from pay phones , he said nearly 90 percent of all alarms are reported by telephone , he said , a vast majority coming from phones in homes , offices and cars and from cellular telephones if residents try to report a fire and find broken pay phones , mr safir said , they can turn to neighbors or drivers with car phones the survey found that in some neighborhoods , particularly along quiet streets in lowrise residential areas , there were few pay phones or none at all in bensonhurst , brooklyn , and new dorp on staten island , milelong stretches of many residential streets had no public telephones at the same time , city alarm boxes stood every two or three blocks on most of these streets along a 16block length of blake avenue in east new york , brooklyn a neighborhood where , as in many other poor areas , some residents do not have home phones only two public phones were in place , both working on a corner at every other block , however , a red firealarm box stood deactivated last fall when the fire department was testing the effects of removing the alarms there are just not enough phones on the street , said a resident of blake avenue who identified herself as c hardy we do n't have a way to let them know if there s a fire the fire department is still evaluating the experiment that began in late september in ms hardy s neighborhood and while a final report is due in about a week , fire officials already indicate they believe the test was a great success false alarms dropped greatly in neighborhoods where the boxes were temporarily deactivated , officials said in preliminary reports , and the number of serious fires , serious injuries and deaths were about the same as they were during the same period the previous year after the department announced in october 1994 that it would remove the entire firealarm system , it was blocked by court challenges from guy v molinari , the staten island borough president , and ruth w messinger , the manhattan borough president there was also a prolonged battle with the city council , which ended last september when the mayor and council agreed to the 45day test involving 25 percent of the boxes mr giuliani and mr safir say that dismantling the alarm boxes citywide would sharply reduce the number of false alarms , freeing up firefighters for real emergencies not only fires , but also a new program under which firefighters have begun responding to cardiac emergencies they also say the city would save 5 million a year , the cost of maintaining the alarm boxes there is this myth that alarm boxes are reliable , mr safir said over a year , nearly twothirds of the city s alarm boxes go out of service for varying periods , he said mr safir said , too , that the council s public safety committee which resisted his plan to remove alarm boxes last year had recommended in a hearing in 1978 that the newer kind of fire alarm boxes , with intercoms , be removed council members were concerned about the large number of false alarms called in on the newer boxes , he said , and about potential dangers posed by department protocols , under which fire units often do not respond to alarms from an intercom box unless dispatchers can speak with the person who pulled the alarm

vienna , june 5 iraq loomed large today as the beleaguered organization of petroleum exporting countries met to consider how it will accommodate the increase in oil production now that a sixyear ban by the united nations on iraqi oil exports has been lifted facing saturated markets and an end to winterdriven demand for heating oil , the united nations decision last month to allow iraq to exchange some oil for food is presenting saudi arabia , kuwait , iran , venezuela and other major oil producers with a quandary none of them are willing to sacrifice part of their oil production to make room for the anticipated 700 , 000 to a million barrels a day that could flow from iraq as early as next month at the same time , if total opec production is increased by that amount , prices could drop sharply , cutting into the revenues of all oil producers as the 12 members of opec opened their first truly difficult gathering since the 19901991 persian gulf war , the prospect of finding a plan to smooth the reintegration of iraq into their ranks seemed remote in vienna s plush hotels , senior executives from an array of american , european and japanese oil companies were lining up to meet with iraqi officials , looking for deals with a country that holds the world s secondlargest oil reserves after those of saudi arabia in washington , a state department spokesman said american oil companies would be able to buy iraqi crude oil as it comes back on the market united states companies have been barred from buying iraqi oil since the persian gulf war it s important to the us oil companies , said cyrus h tahmassebi , an oil consultant for energy trends inc in maryland the ability to buy iraqi crude will create more competition among the suppliers of oil in the past exxon , shell and coastal have been major buyers of iraqi crude oil oil experts firmly predicted that prices could fall to 16 a barrel from the current level of 18 to 20 a barrel if opec chooses to ignore the coming tide of iraq crude and refined oil products iraq is authorized to sell 2 billion of oil every 180 days at current prices we hope to double that figure , said iraq s oil minister , amer mohammed rashid , as opec oil ministers began their meeting this afternoon before it invaded kuwait in august 1990 , provoking united nations sanctions that froze out its oil exports , iraq pumped 34 million barrels a day and exported 3 million barrels with prices lower , iraq would have to pump more oil to fill its united nations quota , which in turn would provoke a further price collapse in recent days prices have slipped , and the contract for july delivery fell 72 cents today , to 1972 a barrel on the new york mercantile exchange oil is pouring out of other oilproducing countries norway and britain , for example , are pumping nearly six million barrels a day from the north sea , with the likelihood that production will continue to rise until the end of the century and new producers in the caucasus are preparing to start exporting oil and as they gathered here today , the opec oil ministers were certain that another member of the group , gabon , has all but decided to quit , as ecuador did more than a year ago gabon s departure would leave 11 members the biggest problem , however , is that most opec members widely exceed the production quotas they agreed to observe venezuela , for example , is exceeding its opecassigned quota by 600 , 000 barrels a day , pumping as much as 29 million barrels a day the united arab emirates , kuwait , nigeria and iran are also exceeding their quotas altogether , opec members are producing more than 26 million barrels a day the quota they agreed to three years ago is 245 million let s face it this planet is producing more oil than it has ever done before is the demand sustainable \? wondered peter gignoux , manager of the petroleum desk at smith barney in london , in an interview today this looming flood is coupled with the sudden lifting of what has been an inordinately higher demand for oil in a rough winter that generated much need for heating oil and other refined crude oil products oil experts here say the answer is lower prices and soon nordine ait laoussine , former oil minister of algeria who is an international oil consultant , predicted in an interview today that unless opec stems this flood oil prices will drop further by july and the cartel may be unable to stop the bleeding opec may still be alive but it is quite impotent , he said oystein berentsen , manager of oil trading in london for statoil , the norwegian oil giant , said what s new here is that this meeting ushers in iraq as a major opec producer again with iraq you 've got to keep in mind they will sell more oil the lower the price falls and keep at it because they have got to have the money
after months of assurances from transit officials that there would be no more cuts in subway and bus service until 2000 or beyond , the new president of the transit authority warned yesterday that he might have to cut service to balance the authority s budget the warning by lawrence g reuter , who took over the transit authority on monday , came just a few months after declining city , state and federal subsidies led to the first widespread service cuts in two decades and the first fare increase in almost four years in calling for the fare increase , transit officials had said it was part of a financial plan that would prevent the need for any additional service cuts for five years but in a wideranging interview with reporters yesterday , mr reuter said , there could be some service reductions he stressed that he would look first at cutting administration and wringing costcutting concessions from the unions cutting service , he said , would be considered only as the last resort to balance the budget he did not say when that decision might have to be made , though with this year s budget looking fairly secure , it appears certain that such cuts would not happen for some time mr reuter , who oversaw service cuts as chief of the washington transit agency , later said that he meant that service cuts would be considered only if factors outside of our control affected the financial plan , like further reductions in federal aid mr reuter s assessment of the transit authority s fiscal health was stark we 've got some very serious and tremendous challenges , as i look at the financial situation , he said there will be some downsizing of the organization i think ultimately , there will be some service changes he said that he would not allow the transit system to fall into disrepair , but that if all else failed , he might have to consider steps like eliminating lightly traveled bus lines and closing littleused subway stations he also said he would study whether it made sense to continue operating the franklin avenue shuttle , a short , decrepit subway line in brooklyn with a small ridership that has been proposed for closing several times , but saved each time by neighborhood protests his remarks were a shift from what has been heard recently from the leaders of the metropolitan transportation authority , the transit authority s parent agency mr reuter s boss , e virgil conway , the mta chairman , has insisted that there will be no service cuts at least through the end of 1999 , and he repeated that assertion yesterday zenia mucha , a spokeswoman for gov george e pataki , said , both mr conway and mr reuter have assured us that the current financial plan will not result in any need for a cut in service since 1989 , the authority s staff has dropped by 5 , 000 , to about 38 , 000 , and 1 , 500 more jobs are slated for elimination this year in the same period , its operating budget , which is about 3 billion a year , has shrunk by about 20 percent when adjusted for inflation in the last year , the transit authority has lost about 300 million a year in city , state and federal subsidies mayor rudolph w giuliani eliminated most of the city s support for free student transit passes , congress cut all mass transit subsidies and may eliminate them entirely , and governor pataki reduced support for the transit authority while increasing it for every other transit agency in the state last year , the mta ordered a round of budget cuts that included less service on 11 subway lines , elimination of several bus lines and reduction in the cleaning and maintenance staffs it also raised the fare 25 cents , to 150 mr conway proposed the fare increase last august as part of a fiveyear financial plan that he said would mean no more service cuts or fare increases at least through 1999 it also promised 73 billion in capital improvements from 1997 through 1999 , despite the state s signaling that it would contribute no new money to that effort the capital program would be paid for largely by borrowing billions of dollars , and by diverting billions more from sources of money that are now used for daytoday operations all this would be accomplished , mr conway said , by cutting costs by 500 million a year , without any harm to service and with none of the deferred maintenance that led to the subway system s nearcollapse in the 1970 s much of that savings is expected to come from labor , and in fact , the transit authority s 1996 budget assumes that by the middle of the year , the unions will have agreed to 100 million a year worth of concessions like changes in work rules and allowing parttime employees almost from the day it was released , mr conway s plan was derided by former transit officials and riders' groups as a prescription for higher fares , poorer service , deferred maintenance , a mountain of debt or a combination of those factors some of the sharpest criticism came from robert r kiley , who , as mta chairman from 1983 to 1990 , presided over the rebuilding of the subway system from its nadir reuter knows what everyone else knows about the finances , and he s being honest , saying cutting service is the last he wants to do , but he ca n't rule it out , said mr kiley , who is now the executive director of the new york city partnership , an alliance of corporate executives informed of mr reuter s remarks yesterday , beverly j dolinsky , executive director of the transit riders council and a nonvoting member of the mta board , said this is what we 've been saying all along it s a huge amount of money they 've got to come up with , and i do n't know how they 're going to do it ms dolinsky predicted that there would be no cuts before the gubernatorial election in november , 1998 , because virgil is the governor s person
four days after crashing in the florida everglades , an airliner with a long and checkered maintenance history remains a focus of shock , mystery and anxiety to the public and commercial aviation sunk in a swamp only minutes from the miami airport , the wreckage of the dc9 resists strenuous efforts to recover its remains and learn its secrets investigators and officials , some quarreling openly with each other , can promise only that the answers will not come quickly that is especially unfortunate , because the flying public as well as the families of the 109 people who perished on valujet s flight 592 deserve to know what brought about this tragedy the accident has raised disturbing questions about air safety , the condition of aggressive , costcutting smaller airlines and the ability of government to simultaneously regulate and promote the airtravel industry above all , everyone wants to know whether it is safe to fly on cheap , nofrills airlines like valujet , less than three years old but equipped with planes cast off by established carriers federico pena , the secretary of transportation , and david hinson , the federal aviation administrator , were quick to pronounce the airline safe but it is disturbing that mary schiavo , inspector general of the transportation department and a pilot herself , avoided flying on valujet because of its many mishaps , and also shuns commuter planes and marginal airlines have the competitive , smaller startup airlines been allowed to expand too fast \? valujet has suffered a rash of equipment mishaps , and its planes had been forced no fewer than seven times to return to their terminals before last saturday s crash yet faa officials have praised the airline s corrective responses until last weekend , none of the new companies had suffered a crash since deregulation in 1978 , which attracted many new entrants to the airtravel market the mere age of aircraft has not mattered much to overall industry safety larger , mature airlines have planes of similar vintage , but unlike valujet they do not farm out their maintenance work has that made a difference \? the faa , in a flurry of investigative actions , says it will scrutinize both the airline and its maintenance contractors meanwhile the agency itself will be investigated , according to ms schiavo , the inspector general from an office that enjoys broad independence , she has already criticized the faa s inspector force , valujet s safety record and even the dual mission of the faa to advance commercial aviation while policing its safety she pledges an inquiry into alleged and undefined pressure on inspectors to play down concerns about airworthiness ms schiavo s skepticism is a welcome ingredient , more assuring in its way than mr hinson s promise to reassure the public that valujet is a safe carrier the airline , other cutrate carriers and the public deserve both openminded judges and full , fair investigations
the superintendents who oversee new york city s elementary and middle schools have long complained that the city s sprawling high schools soaked up a disproportionate share of precious education dollars so it came as a surprise last week when schools chancellor rudy crew , in the most exhaustive accounting in the system s history , concluded that the high schools actually get much less an average of about 398 less per student than the elementary schools and 760 less than the junior high schools they would always say we got more money , said john j ferrandino , who retired recently as the supervising superintendent of city high schools i would always say we did n't no one would believe me until now while individual school spending in the city s 32 community school districts has been publicly scrutinized by previous chancellors , none has done so as extensively as dr crew and none has included the city s high schools an examination of those 1996 figures , sifted out of the 41volume report prepared by dr crew s budget staff and the accounting firm peat marwick , shows several discrepancies in spending for high schools high schools with the biggest concentrations of poor students , for example , spend less city tax money in the classroom than those with more middleclass students , an analysis of the figures shows but the schools with poor students more than make up for the difference with the sizable supplements they receive from federal , state and private grants it was not immediately clear from the data whether the city was adjusting its allotment to these schools because they get these grants the figures also confirm , in many cases , the suspicions of some of the city s larger high schools that the batch of small , experimental academies that have proliferated in the last four years often receive more money per student but the findings that created the greatest buzz within the system last week were those that , for the first time , measured budget allocations in the high schools against other schools in the city the breakdown shows that high schools receive an average of 6 , 831 per student , compared with 7 , 229 for elementary schools and 7 , 591 for the junior high schools in many systems across the country , the high schools spend the most money per pupil because high school students require more extensive guidance services to prepare for college and take more expensive and specialized courses , like advancedplacement chemistry , that have smaller class sizes new york city is , apparently , different while the reasons are varied and not always clear , the most salient factors are the share of budget cuts the high schools absorbed in the last three years , the severe overcrowding of high school buildings and the need to provide meals to younger students part of the difference can be explained by size it costs less per student to administer and supply teachers to a large high school because those costs can be divided among more students and when taken together , the city s high schools are filled to nearly 140 percent of capacity , a degree of overcrowding that dwarfs most elementary and middle schools thus , the salary paidto the principal at newtown high school in elmhurst , queens , is spread over 4 , 573 students , while that at public school 209 in whitestone must be absorbed by just 511 students line items like food also increase the budgets of elementary and middle schools , where students eat in school more often in community school district 9 in the south bronx , for example , the 356 spent per pupil on food was more than double the average spent on food in all bronx high schools but perpupil spending in the high schools was also affected by something far less fixed the more than 1 billion in budget cuts imposed in the last three years and while no school in the system was spared , chancellor crew and his predecessor , ramon c cortines , tried to preserve the spending on children in the younger grades because they are at a critical stage in their development some elementary schools gave up music and art classes , as well as assistant principals but many high schools were hit harder they lost elective courses like psychology , sociology and advancedplacement history had to raise guidancecounselor caseloads to 1 , 000 students or more were forced to eliminate junior varsity sports and bands , and , in dozens of cases , even pared the school day to below the five and a half hours required by the state , drawing a reprimand the whole system has been underfunded , said john soldini , an economics teacher at tottenville high school in staten island and the vice president for academic high schools in the united federation of teachers but the high schools were placed in even greater peril the budget report released last week makes clear that there are wide variations in spending among the high schools particularly in schools with large pockets of students living below the poverty level a computer analysis by the new york times of the chancellor s data on 153 high schools 90 with high concentrations of poverty and 63 with low concentrations found that those with the highest number of poor students spent an average of 348 less , per pupil , in city tax money on direct classroom services but in the end , the spending in schools with the poorest students was 480 more per student because those schools get more of the private , state and federal grants most of those dollars came from the title 1 program , which last year added 323 million to budgets of schools with poor students so they could hire teachers , teachers' aides and afterschool counselors in preparing the report , the chancellor s aides said they were not able to specify how many of those supplemental dollars reached the classroom , in the form of teachers' salaries and textbooks , and how many provided instructional support outside the classroom the omission is substantial , given that that money represents 13 percent of the system s 82 billion overall budget the chancellor said he hoped to account for the money in future reports and what of the system s bumper crop of experimental , alternative academies \? how did they fare financially \? designed around themes like the city s museums or its underground infrastructure , more than 100 such schools have attracted several thousand students in the last four years the amount allotted per student at three bronx academies fannie lou hamer freedom \( 10 , 340 \) , south bronx academy for community leadership \( 9 , 212 \) and wings academy \( 8 , 796 \) exceeded that at two larger , more traditional high schools , william h taft \( 5 , 790 \) and bronx science \( 6 , 463 \) but again , school size plays a role and far more analysis will be required to determine if the schools that spend more per student actually get their students to achieve more the ultimate measure of how well their dollars are spent we 've got to caution people not to make too much out of the financial numbers alone , said robert berne , the vice president for academic development at new york university and a longtime student of the board of education budget this report only increases , exponentially , the number of questions that can be asked table how new york city s high schools spend their money last week , for the first time , schools chancellor rudy crew opened the books on new york city s 1 , 100 public schools , issuing a detailed breakdown of 1996 budget allocations figures are for the 195 high schools the five highest in each category in spending are in bold the five lowest have asterisks spending specified by grants includes antipoverty and antidrug and programs from government and private sources \( pg 42

continental airlines is setting its sights on some pretty important targets elitelevel participants in its competitors' frequentflier plans continental is making these individuals an offer it hopes they ca n't refuse it will automatically enroll them as elite members of its one pass frequentflier program if they can document their elite status in a competing carrier s plan the logic behind this offer is simple continental which reported a record 41 million net profit last week for the fourth quarter of 1995 wants to bolster its gains by winning over the lucrative business travel market according to greg brenneman , continental s chief operating officer , business travelers , who often must buy their tickets at the last minute at a premium , pay an average of 31 cents for each mile they fly on continental , while leisure passengers on the airline pay an average of only 9 cents since elite frequent fliers travel more often than business travelers in general , any additional participation by them in one pass could be a gold mine for the airline this is not the first time in recent years that continental has deliberately wooed frequent travelers famous for generous one pass upgrades , the carrier tightened up these benefits in early 1994 and alienated many of its frequent fliers one of the first things the carrier s president , gordon bethune , did when he took over later that year was to restore the benefits to their previous levels some of continental s competitors , none of which are copying what one dubs elitenapping , said continental s latest promotion could alienate current one pass elite participants besides creating greater demand for a finite number of seat upgrades , the promotion dilutes elite membership , said a delta spokesman , todd clay it s something these people worked hard to achieve , and it messes up the integrity of the program he added rivals admitted , however , to doing a little elitenapping themselves but only on specific routes , in select markets new textile center new york s metropolitan museum of art has a new textile center , underwritten by toyota of japan and the ratti group , which is based in como , italy , and produces silk fabrics the antonio ratti taxtile center is an excellent resource for executives in the garment , textile and related industries visitors to the center can look up any of the 20 , 000 computerdigitized images of many of the 36 , 000 textiles in the museum s collection , which date from 3 , 000 bc to the present objects in the collection can be viewed by advance appointment the center s phone number is \( 212 \) 6502310 o'hare medical clinic a fullservice medical clinic is now in operation on the upper level of terminal two at o'hare international airport in chicago open daily from 6 am until midnight , the clinic is staffed by doctors and nurses from the university of illinois at chicago medical center , who provide advanced first aid and evaluation , among other services fees are comparable to those charged by hospital emergency rooms hotel update executives visiting geneva can have their business and travel needs attended to in the business bar in the lobby of the hotel du rhone , which is in the center of geneva s financial district comfortably furnished and equipped with a stock monitor , the facility rents laptop computers and portable phones , and offers copying , typing , translation , binding and fax services the staff can make travel reservations and issue tickets lunch , afternoon tea , drinks and dessert also are served the business bar is open to hotel guests and nonguests alike weekdays from 8 am to 6 pm guests staying at the ali'i tower of the hilton hawaiian village and who traveled from tokyo to honolulu in first or businessclass cabins of ual s united airlines can check in to the hotel before leaving the tarmac in japan united s concierge staff gives the hilton guests their hotel keys after they 've checked in for their flight and boarded the aircraft once the travelers arrive in hawaii , hilton handles their luggage and brings them by limousine to the ali'i tower hilton says it will expand this service to other cities like new york , san francisco and los angeles working women one thousand readers of working woman magazine polled by london s athenaeum hotel said they had received secondclass treatment from hotels when they traveled alone besides finding staff patronizing , flirtatious or downright rude , 64 percent of the women said hotel security measures were inadequate many also said they felt unwelcome in public areas \( 75 percent ate dinner in their room \) a total of 88 percent of the respondents said waiters assumed a male guest was choosing the wine and paying the check however , less than half those surveyed \( 41 percent \) were willing to complain
a few months before he announced his bid for the presidency in september , steve forbes settled an agediscrimination suit brought by his former personal secretary who was dismissed three weeks before her 65th birthday the secretary , anne barton , had worked for 13 years as mr forbes s secretary at forbes magazine in midtown manhattan before he dismissed her in august 1991 the younger woman who replaced mrs barton testified that the magazine s personnel manager told her she was taking the place of an older woman \( who \) did n't fit in the suit , which was filed in federal district court in manhattan in february 1993 , was settled in april 1995 for an undisclosed sum the settlement included a confidentiality agreement that prohibited either side from commenting on the case in a statement friday , mr forbes said unfortunately in today s litigious society many business decisions made in good faith wind up in lawsuits i'm pleased the case of barton v forbes inc was settled on an amicable basis mrs barton s lawyer , jeffrey m bernbach , said neither he nor his client could discuss the terms of the settlement mrs barton would not have brought this case , he said , if she did not believe she was discriminated against on the basis of age earlier this year , judge peter k leisure rejected a motion by lawyers for forbes inc to dismiss the case judge leisure ruled that , when evaluated in a light most favorable to mrs barton , the evidence showed that she was performing her job satisfactorily when mr forbes decided to dismiss her he said a jury could reasonably conclude that she was dismissed because mr forbes believed she was too old to continue working the evidence singled out by the judge included the deposition of sheila hollingsworth , who was 38 when she was hired as mrs barton s successor ms hollingsworth said the forbes personnel manager , karen bono , told her she was replacing an older woman she also said another employee of mr forbes told her that mrs barton did n't fit in , was n't a team player , conflicts and that she was an older person judge leisure said that a jury could reasonably conclude that ms bono s statement about mrs barton s age also reflected mr forbes s attitute toward his secretary because the personnel manager was interviewing people on his behalf mr forbes s lawyers attacked ms hollingsworth s credibility , highlighting contradictions in her resume , trying to persuade a federal magistrate to find her in contempt of court and pointing out that she left the job after three weeks herself in a lengthy deposition in the case , mr forbes said he had dismissed mrs barton because she was incompetent and disrupted the operation of his office after he took over as chairman of forbes following the death of his father , malcolm forbes sr , in 1990 he said that she was not up to the tougher demands of his new position among his complaints was that she mishandled his mail and once failed to summon him from a meeting to take a telephone call from former president ronald reagan instead of yanking me out of the office , he said , anne took a message about the same time as the reagan incident , mr forbes said , he criticized mrs barton because she had told a forbes executive vice president that mr forbes was attending a breakfast out of the office , rather than simply explaining when he was expected back mr forbes said he decided to dismiss mrs barton in late 1990 or early 1991 he said he had told leonard yablon , a forbes executive , to prepare a retirement package for her he said he wanted to offer her retirement to save her the embarrassment of being terminated mrs barton said she had a conversation with mr yablon in april 1991 in which he said we are none of us as young as we used to be and we all of us have a lot more gray hair than we used to have you thought about retirement \? keep it in mind mr forbes said he postponed dismissing mrs barton when her daughter died when he approached her on aug 16 , 1991 , with the proposal that she take early retirement , mrs barton said she did not want to retire mr forbes terminated her that day judge leisure said a jury could reasonably infer that mr yablon s statement about gray hair and retirement would have reflected mr forbes s sentiments records in the court files indicated that none of the 40 secretaries at forbes were 65 or over , but mr forbes , 48 , denied that he advocated mandatory retirement but , in a 1977 editorial in the magazine , he cautioned congress to think long and hard before axing the principle of mandatory retirement at age 65 , at least in the private sector
scottsdale , ariz in the 1970 s , when the pittsburgh steelers were winning all those super bowls four in all nfl films approached the steelers with the idea of naming them the nation s team the idea was to produce a fancy documentary highlighting the steelers' success and their national prominence one small problem , though art and dan rooney would have none of that why , the steelers were pittsburgh s team , the rooneys said and that was good enough for the rooneys and though art , the patriarch of this proud franchise , is gone \( he died at age 89 in 1988 \) , dan , his son , age 63 , remains as the team s guiding light actually , dan rooney is much more than that he has been a beacon of light for the entire league , a voice of rationale when everything appears awry and a man who is completely comfortable in the backseat when everything is rosy so , little wonder that dan rooney had to be prodded and coaxed yesterday to walk up to the podium at the team s headquarters here to chat about the steelers reaching super bowl xxx but he did it , with grace and dignity , in just the manner that he handles nearly everything that he touches dan rooney is a rarity in pro sports today a member of the steelers' organization for 38 years and president since 1975 , he has resisted the temptation over the 16 years that have passed since pittsburgh last reached the super bowl to clean house repeatedly in an effort to win big again at all costs nearly as remarkable , he has not allowed himself to wilt under any internal pressure of trying to match the legendary super bowl success the steelers achieved when his father was alive in fact , his stature within the league has continued to grow despite the steelers' lack of recent super bowl success in an era of hightech sophistication and modernization that teams employ in efforts to nab championships , rooney has kept things simple in pittsburgh he has held true to the longtime league axiom that each team is only as great as the sum of the league s entire 30 parts that what is good for the national football league is good for pittsburgh look around with franchises seeking to bolt their cities at will and with independent marketing agreements for teams becoming more common , that is a noble idea under tremendous fire rooney helps to keep it alive it s the people that matter most , the people in our organization , the fans , and it will always be that way in pittsburgh , rooney said people are meaningful everybody can have input i believe in that as far as matching or competing against my father , what does that mean \? he would not have wanted it that way that was not the way our relationship was we were family we are family and the people of pittsburgh have not treated me that way , as if i had to match him in super bowls they have not turned it into that kind of impossible situation he insists that the steelers have been close to the super bowl in recent years so close last year , in fact , that they were only three yards away in the american football conference championship game versus san diego he said that the former steelers great joe greene told him recently that fans look back on those old championship steelers teams and think of them as dominant and invincible in fact , greene said , each of those championships came after hefty struggles clos' calls a play here or there that changed everything and now rooney applauds his coach , bill cowher , for overcoming hurdles , for surviving the indianapolis colts' lastplay desperation pass that nearly sent the steelers home this season these young people , he said , have earned it , and the recognition is all theirs' they have come of age dan rooney knows plenty about that he has been aligned with the league s old guard of owners when in fact , 'e said , he is simply part of the tradition of the nfl he talked about how pittsburgh s super bowl xxx opponent , the dallas cowboys , are different in that they use the big sell , the america s team label , to push their franchise while the steelers remain a relatively small fish , one part of the 30 both franchises are similar though , he said , in that they have built inhouse through the draft in attempting to win and he wants teams in the nfl to remember that it s the football end of it that s important , he said we 're here for the game we 're not here for nike we 're not here for coke some might take that as a direct slap at jerry jones , the dallas owner , who has pushed the cowboys into a new realm in marketing and has been sued by the league and has sued the league in the process but rooney said no , that jones is ok , that they have differences but that they think alike in terms of football that jones is still a part of the nfl that s dan rooney much like his dad he makes room and has time and concern for everyone
east rutherford , nj you ca n't run with it or pass it or catch it you ca n't tackle it or block it but you know when you have it and you know when you do n't have it it s called chemistry and in pro football , sometimes it s as important as , if not more important than , all the strength and speed on a team some people think that it creates winning , others that winning creates it either way , a team needs it in order to be a champion or even a contender ten years ago the giants had it in winning super bowl xxi , and yesterday , when 31 of those 1986 players were honored at halftime , the giants upset the cowboys , 206 , in a performance that might create chemistry or , if you believe center brian williams , increase their chemistry i think we 've had chemistry , the giants center was saying after we lost to carolina and stuck together , i think that s when it started at that point , it would have been very easy for us to give up but the coaching staff picked us up , and we picked ourselves up we lost in arizona the next week , but we had it this win will only add to our confidence this was the giants' most significant victory over a significant opponent in the three seasons of the dave brown era at quarterback maybe the cowboys took the giants lightly maybe the cowboys are too battered by injuries maybe the cowboys are n't what they were in winning three of the last four super bowls but whatever the cowboys are or are n't , the giants made the big plays that the cowboys usually make the big plays that turn games three forced fumbles tito wooten returned one for 54 yards and a 133 halftime lead phillippi sparks stripped wide receiver deion sanders and the giants recovered on their 4yard line interceptions by jason sehorn and perry ellsworth kept the cowboys without a touchdown for the second straight game i knew it all along , coach dan reeves joked reeves was beaming not only from the victory but from the game ball he received from his players following a week spent reading and hearing how he will be out as coach when the season ends i 've gotten a lot of game balls , he said , but there are none more special than this one optimists were even wondering if the giants could make the super bowl playoffs if they were to win their four remaining games for a 97 record realists were waiting for the outcome of the next two games , at philadelphia and at miami , before the giants return home to finish the season against new orleans and new england those four games will provide the litmus paper in the giants' chemistry lab that the 1986 team considered so important i do n't think the current giants are short on talent , i think they 're short on chemistry , george martin , a defensive end and cocaptain on that super bowl team , was saying before the game we were n't just teammates we were friends we realized going to the next level depended on family but with free agency producing an almost yearly turnover of personnel , can that chemistry be developed \? absolutely , martin said but you have to go out and get leaders these players have n't come of age yet harry carson was n't so sure to the linebacker who was the other defensive cocaptain on that 172 giants team , one reason for its success was the gradual growth from the dismal losing seasons free agency does n't allow that growth i do n't see players staying in a situation to win like we had to do , carson said , alluding to those seasons before free agency it s all about money now guys are n't thinking about their teammates they 're thinking about themselves that theory will be tested when some of the young giants are eligible for free agency will they stay with the hope of trying to win together \? or will they jump elsewhere for more money \? you used to be able to make money off the field in new york , carson said that s irrelevant now because of the money being paid elsewhere a guy can go to jacksonville or carolina and play on grass , living does n't cost him as much i think the giants are at a disadvantage now in attracting free agents and the offensive right tackle on that 1986 team , karl nelson , stricken with hodgkin s disease soon thereafter , talked about how in free agency now , the best teams keep the core together , two or three stars , in order to maintain their chemistry maybe he was thinking of the cowboys with troy aikman , emmitt smith and michael irvin but yesterday the giants beat those cowboys by making big plays and smothering smith he rushed for only 18 yards on 11 carries before sitting out the entire fourth quarter it might be the start of something big for the giants , but then again , it might be merely a tease even if you ca n't see it or touch it , next sunday in philadelphia you 'll know much more about the giants' chemistry photo marcus buckley \( 55 \) celebrating the giants' imminent victory over the cowboys late in the fourth quarter \( barton silverman the new york times \)
bal harbour , fla , feb 21 a day after patrick j buchanan won the new hampshire primary by campaigning as a champion of workers' concerns , the leader of the american labor movement denounced the republican candidate as racist , antisemitic and opposed to the interests of american workers john j sweeney , president of the aflcio , asserted that mr buchanan only pretended to be a friend of workers , saying the candidate not only wanted to weaken occupational safety rules but also opposed an increase to the minimum wage and laws that would make it easier for workers to join unions saying patrick buchanan speaks for workers is like saying the ayatollah khomeini speaks for priests and rabbis , mr sweeney said today at a meeting of the aflcio executive council here i do n't think working americans are going to be fooled by a presidential candidate who talks the talk , but wo n't walk the walk mr sweeney spearheaded a coordinated attack on mr buchanan by union leaders here , with many of them voicing frustration and anger that the candidate had stolen labor s oratory to appear as the advocate of millions of workers who are anxious about falling wages and layoffs steven rosenthal , the aflcio political director , said it s like a wolf in sheep s clothing he wants american workers to think he has the answers but he has not put forward one proposal that s good for american workers mr sweeney faulted mr buchanan for embracing the same economic theories advocated by president ronald reagan , which the labor leader said have transferred billions of dollars from the tattered pocketbooks of middleincome americans to the silklined purses of the rich over the past 15 years patrick buchanan is a racist , he s antisemitic , he bashes women right along with labor and immigration , and he s a believer in supplyside economics , mr sweeney asserted we are none of those things at a breakfast with reporters on monday , mr sweeney said he broadly agreed with mr buchanan s calls for scrapping the north american free trade agreement and the world trade organization but today , he distanced himself from mr buchanan on trade , saying that unlike the republican the federation favored open markets and that it opposed nafta for reasons different from mr buchanan s expanding our exports means good jobs , and we 're for it , he said but we have to demand that we are not discriminated against in foreign markets at their meeting today , the executive council s 54 members approved the federation s most ambitious campaign plans ever , vowing to raise 35 million to educate americans on prounion issues and help democratic house candidates
in the final trial of police officers from the scandalridden 30th precinct , a manhattan supreme court jury yesterday found two officers guilty of stealing money from a drug dealer in northwest harlem but in a mixed verdict , the jury apparently could not agree on how much was taken and found the officers not guilty of grand larceny the verdict seemed to reflect many of the ambiguities in prosecuting the worst scandal in the history of new york s police department , in which corrupt officers were often the main witnesses against their colleagues more than a sixth , or 33 , of the officers from the 30th precinct were arrested in the scandal on charges ranging from perjury to stealing drugs , cash and guns the precinct , in one of the city s highestcrime neighborhoods , earned the nickname the dirty 30 the outcome of the latest case was typical of the other trials the two officers , stephen setteducato , 44 , and danny parson , 47 , who joined the department on the same day in 1973 , were accused of grand larceny and evidence tampering for submitting a false official voucher for the amount of money they found in a safe taken from a drug dealer there was some 35 , 000 in the safe when the officers seized it , testimony at the trial revealed , but they submitted a voucher for only 15 , 000 in the case against mr setteducato and mr parson , prosecutors said , other officers testified that handfuls of cash were grabbed from the safe but the jury apparently could not agree on the amount the two took , and found them not guilty of the grand larceny charge that charge requires proof that more than 1 , 000 was stolen instead , jurors found the two men guilty of evidence tampering , a more serious charge that carries a sentence of up to seven years the two officers received the verdict stoically yesterday evening surrounded by family members who had waited patiently through three days of deliberations , they left the courthouse without commenting none of the jurors would discuss their verdict prosecutors , however , quickly took credit for what they said was a victory in a long and difficult string of cases we 're very pleased , said dan castleman , chief of the investigations division in the manhattan district attorney s office , after the verdict was announced as in the trials of other dirty 30 officers , the one decided yesterday relied heavily on the testimony of police officers themselves convicted of crimes , a fact prosecutors said added to the difficulty of these cases i think it was one of the more difficult cases this was a case largely based on cooperators' testimony , mr castleman said , referring to the other officers who testified the jury had no problem believing they stole something i think this jury was very thoughtful and honest they had trouble with the value of what they took lawyers for the two men said they would appeal the grand larceny was the charge , said paul s brenner , mr setteducato s lawyer if they 're not guilty of stealing money , how can they be accused of tampering with records \? clearly the jury compromised to avoid continued deliberations yesterday s verdict brought the total of officers found guilty in state court to 20 of these , 13 entered guilty pleas and 7 were convicted after a trial there has been only one acquittal of mr setteducato , who was found not guilty in january on charges of lying under oath about an arrest and stealing money from the suspect in the case in federal court , 18 officers have entered guilty pleas some 21 officers remain to be sentenced in federal and state courts the 30th precinct , the dirty 30 , became a precinct totally out of control , mr castleman said , where police officers violated the basic oaths they took , where from being protectors , they became predators the effects were not limited to a large shakeup in a single precinct and official vows to get tough on police corruption because so many of the officers had committed perjury , some 90 criminal cases , involving 125 defendants , had to be thrown out , and 13 people had to be released from jail there have been even more farreaching effects it has increased the deterioration of the relationships between the police and that community , mr castleman said it has made a lot of the people suspicious of police officers it s made things much more difficult for the vast majority of honest cops chart update trials of a corrupt precinct the last trial of 33 police officers from harlkem s 30th precinct ended yesterday here are which federal and state charges

newark , june 20 a federal grand jury charged the newark police director today with using a department fund as a personal bank account , spending the money on items like gifts for his wife and girlfriend , trips to bermuda and mexico city and campaign contributions to the mayor and others federal prosecutors said at a news conference that the official , william r celester , stole 30 , 000 from the investigation account they also charged that he illegally kept 26 , 569 from a fundraising event for his second anniversary as police director mr celester was appointed as a top police official to serve the public , not to steal from the public , united states attorney faith s hochberg said mr celester s tenure as police director , ms hochberg added , was marked by a pattern of corruption and theft his indictment on 37 counts of fraud , theft and tax evasion is the latest twist in a continuing scandal that has gripped the largest city in new jersey in recent years three city council members have been convicted of corruption , the top aide and a close friend of mayor sharpe james has been charged with accepting bribes , and the troubled school system has been taken over by the state as well as investigating the highlevel operations of the james administration , federal prosecutors have been examining whether money was diverted from a charity set up by the mayor mr celester s lawyer said today that the police director had a reasonable explanation for the expenditures and that none of his client s actions were illegal the heart of the indictment is a list of 80 checks that prosecutors say mr celester used to siphon money from the account from july 1991 to march 1995 most items are less than 500 and are for expenses like the gifts for his wife and girlfriend and christmas gifts for his office workers , the authorities said one check paid for his wife s automobile insurance and one for a personal trip to boston in response to a subpoena from a federal grand jury the list also includes small political contributions , averaging 200 , to mr james and unidentified city council members ms hochberg , who would not identify the council members , said there was no evidence that the politicians knew that the money was from the departmental account in a statement this afternoon , mr james said that he had transferred mr celester from his 95 , 000ayear position to another post that is largely a symbolic move , because the mayor placed mr celester on administrative leave after federal agents raided his house in november mr james , who said the city would begin an immediate search for a new police director , would not answer questions today the chief of special prosecutions for the united states attorney here , larry r c stephen , said the indictment was another example of the pervasive and systemic corruption in the city of newark when you have an indictment in which the top lawenforcement officer is named , mr stephen said , it speaks volumes about the level of corruption in the city ms hochberg and federal investigators said mr celester s indictment should not be considered a condemnation of the entire 1 , 290member police department but many critics inside and outside the department say it is in disarray , with officers who have been charged with theft and brutality and citizens who complain about poor police response the crime rate remains among the highest in the nation , and federal statistics show that although crime dropped in similar cities last year , it rose 7 percent here the department is plagued with infighting and complaints that officers simply do not respond to thousands of calls for help each year mr celester moved to newark in 1991 from boston , where he was a police commander in the toughest neighborhoods after a successful start here , mr celester began to have personal problems his twin brother , a respected police detective in boston , died , and mr celester was sued on charges that he had caused 30 , 000 of damage to his condominium police investigators soon began to complain that money traditionally used to conduct drug purchases was not available federal prosecutors say that was the money that mr celester used for his personal items in 1993 , mr celester received 26 , 569 from a party for his second anniversary as director , prosecutors said most of the money was from newark officers , and prosecutors said it was a violation of federal and state laws for a police director to accept gifts that year , prosecutors said , mr celester also lied on a mortgage application , saying that 37 , 000 of his down payment would be made with a gift from a relative in fact , mr celester received the 37 , 000 from another , undisclosed , source , prosecutors said if convicted on all charges , mr celester could face up to 40 years in prison he is scheduled to be arraigned in two weeks , although a specific date was not set mr celester s lawyer , anthony pope , said in an interview today that there were reasonable explanations for the spending and the fundraising party he said that mr celester had not spoken to the united states attorney s office about the charges , but that the explanation would be provided in pretrial motions you can indict a chair if you want to , mr pope said this deals with the alleged appropriation of funds and with a party held on mr celester s behalf that he had nothing to do with mr pope would not give the explanation , but said mr celester would prove that he had done nothing illegal this is something that we have been investigating all along , mr pope said it has certainly been no secret what has happened is very explainable , and we are looking to get our day in court investigations in newark william r celester is not the only highranking newark official to face charges of wrongdoing these other figures have been the subjects of separate investigations jackie r mattison a raid in november at the main home of mr mattison , mayor sharpe james s longtime chief of staff , found 100 , 000 mr mattison , 45 , was indicted in january on charges that he accepted money from an insurance broker in exchange for steering city contracts to two insurance companies mr mattison has denied the charges lawrie west stalks the former register of essex county , ms stalks pleaded guilty in september 1995 to accepting kickbacks and conspiring to use her influence as a director of a housing complex in newark to award millions of dollars in contracts to security companies gary s harris and ralph t grant jr in march 1995 mr harris , who was then a member of the city council , and mr grant , a former member , were found guilty of accepting cash bribes from a towing company that wanted to obtain lucrative municipal

duxbury , mass , may 3 john alden and miles standish first settled this seacoast town in 1624 , as the pilgrim colony at nearby plymouth began to seek out new land for its growing cattle herds not much has changed here over the centuries duxbury is still a small town of graceful white colonial homes , an affluent suburb of boston but this week the duxbury high school baseball team touched off a furor that would have made their pious pilgrim antecedents blush , and brought their season to a premature end on the way home from playing a game against a town on cape cod , 31 members of the varsity and junior varsity squads , dressed in their uniforms , stopped at a convenience store in sagamore beach and helped themselves to candy bars , baseball cards and bottles of soda then , without paying , they sauntered out of the store and got back on the team bus with more than 100 worth of merchandise the kids were each taking a different aisle , and proceeded to take anything they could get their hands on , said kim arcase , the cashier who was on duty i caught one boy putting baseball cards in his back pocket and he said , 'i was going to pay for it , ' said ms arcase , who is 40 years old no you were n't , she replied , taking the cards from him you were going to steal it get out of the store the incident deeply upset ms arcase my boss , who owns the store , has it tough here in the winter , she said and what really troubled me was that this was baseball , the allamerican sport , and here these kids were robbing the store initially , she thought of calling the police but what can the police do \? ms arcase wondered they ca n't punish every single one of them instead , the next morning she telephoned officials at duxbury high school what she maintained she heard made her even more angry she said the coaches told her the shoplifting was a team tradition by now , the school principal , wayne ogden , had learned about the shoplifting spree and he warned the students that they would face charges if those responsible for the thievery did not confess by 7 30 the next morning he also told them that no matter what , their remaining 13 games would be forfeited after talking with the coaches and store owners in the region , he could find no other incidents of shoplifting or other evidence to show that it was a tradition brian confer , 18 years old , the left fielder and a cocaptain of the team , said none of the players wanted to inform on their teammates although some of players had not participated in the shoplifting , the team held a meeting and decided the best solution was for everyone to turn in their uniforms it was a really stupid thing to do , mr confer said never in my wildest dreams did i think that my final high school baseball season would end like this my sense is that the players now feel terrible , he said it was n't premeditated it was more of a prank , with kids stealing things to see what they could get away with these kids are not criminals , mr confer said they just made a stupid adolescent mistake it s going to be tough to explain to our college coaches about what happened in our senior year mr ogden , the school principal , said that in addition to forfeiting the games , the players would lose the 135 fee that each paid to participate he also said the players would make full restitution to the store and would undertake a community service project either for the store or at the suggestion of its owner some action may be taken against the team s coaches for failing to report the shoplifting to school officials , mr ogden said he added that after carefully questioning all of the students , he had come to believe they really did not understand why they had taken part in the incident , except that they were in a group i think it frightened a lot of the kids , mr ogden said if this sticks in their heads , and it is like an alarm that goes off the next time , then maybe this will be a worthwhile experience
soldiers who served in the persian gulf war do not appear to have any new or unique illness , but medical studies done so far cannot rule out mild or rare illnesses associated with service there , a panel of experts said yesterday a report by the experts for the institute of medicine , which is affiliated with the national academy of sciences , is the latest in a series from the military , the veterans affairs department and the institute none have found any unusual illnesses among veterans of the war , but more studies are planned , driven by concern among veterans groups the findings are likely to disappoint veterans groups that said they believed that illnesses among those who served in the campaign could be attributed to the war some veterans say the symptoms , like joint pain and memory loss , are characteristic of a new syndrome the institute was asked to review the defense department s comprehensive clinical evaluation program , to which gulf veterans are referred for diagnoses and treatment the report said that the department s program was a thorough and compassionate program to handle medical complaints among gulf veterans about 10 , 000 servicemen and women have received treatment and diagnoses of their symptoms so far under the program the institute s report said there was currently no clinical evidence in the evaluation program for a previously unknown , serious illness among gulf veterans if there were a new or unique illness or syndrome among persian gulf veterans that could cause serious impairment in a high proportion of veterans at risk , it would probably be detectable in the population of 10 , 200 ccep patients , the report said of the program on the other hand , if an unknown illness were mild or only affected a small proportion of veterans at risk , it might not be detectable in a case series , no matter how large the report noted that 37 percent of the gulf veterans treated under the program received diagnoses of psychiatric conditions the report recommended that the military focus attention on diagnosis and treatment for those illnesses dr richard friedman , professor of psychiatry and behavioral science at the state university of new york at stony brook , said the gulf war syndrome was probably not a new disease , and similar symptoms to those found in gulf veterans had been observed among veterans of other wars , even the brief war in panama , as well as among oil workers who must be away from home for six months in a foreign country they go through a great disruption of life , and we would expect that they will show not only psychological symptoms , but that their anxiety , fear and depression will lead to physiological changes and disease , he said dennis m cullinan , deputy director of national legislative services for the veterans of foreign wars , said veterans groups did not expect a quick answer to what was causing symptoms he said more study was needed , especially large epidemiological studies he said the veterans affairs department and the defense department were doing a good job of responding to the concerns of veterans in their studies so far the defense department s clinical evaluation program accepted all gulf war veterans who had medical complaints , and gave them especially thorough examinations and followups the most common symptoms reported in the study were fatigue , joint pain , headache , rash and memory loss the symptoms appeared in different parts of the body in different patients apart from standard illnesses like the flu , the most common diagnoses were psychological conditions and musculoskeletal pain more than 80 percent of the veterans reported no days lost from work because of their symptoms about 7 percent reported a week or more lost the chairman of the committee and author of the report , dr gerard burrow , dean of the yale university school of medicine , said that the military had worked diligently to find physical symptoms of the syndrome and should now consider looking more at psychological causes as well
rye , ny , april 17 teams that lose their playoff opener are n't always this optimistic when that defeat is the sixth in succession , it is rare to hear so much confidence but the rangers voiced only positive thoughts at playland ice casino today as they prepared for game 2 against montreal on thursday night at madison square garden several players said the rangers were the better team even though they lost by 32 in overtime on tuesday night others said they would eventually score more goals if they keep getting so many chances and high shots against jocelyn thibault , the canadiens' goalie , who falls to the ice too soon and mark messier promised that his healing ribs would allow him to play better in game 2 his teammates plan to keep hitting montreal s small forwards to take away their will to win the rangers want to force their attack deep in the montreal zone against inexperienced canadien defensemen we played a better game than they did , said niklas sundstrom , the rookie who scored one new york goal we should have won they had a luckier time than us but if the rangers fall behind by two games to none , they will be forced to win at least two games of a fourofseven round in a city where they are rarely triumphant does n't that make thursday night s game a must victory \? it s not do or die , said pat verbeek last time i checked , it takes four games to eliminate messier , who missed the final six games of the regular season , had a mixed performance , mostly because of the bruised rib cartilage that gives him pain while limiting his mobility , body contact and shot velocity although he assisted on a powerplay goal by adam graves and hit a post on a breakaway , messier was on the ice for all three montreal goals , two of them by vincent damphousse , including the winner in overtime no question , i 'll feel much better , messier predicted it was sore , but i think i 'll be able to do a lot more in every aspect i'm going to be much stronger and better i plan on definitely getting involved more because montreal s coach , mario tremblay , sought to match damphousse against messier , will ranger coach colin campbell who has the last choice on matchups before faceoffs at home try to keep these centers apart \? i'm not going to pull mark off you do n't pull great players off to accommodate , campbell said of the overtime goal , he said we had no problem with mark s line being out there one curious aspect in game 1 was that the canadiens , knowing messier s fragile condition , did n't try to force collisions campbell joked that the rangers had scared them by sending video of menacing messier moments that were reviewed by the league office for possible suspensions or might montreal have preferred messier out there for his defensive liabilities caused by injury \? i do n't think montreal felt , 'let s let him play and he 'll make lots of mistakes , ' campbell said of the game in general , campbell said i do n't know what i would do differently i 'd take that game over exactly again and we 'd win it the coach suggested that the big guy upstairs might have been punishing the rangers for so many poor games late in the regular season as for the rangers' strategy , it is clear by their actions and campbell s words they 're a smaller team , he said we 've got to keep on banging , banging , banging verbeek suggested that the team as a whole could slow montreal s flow by doing a better job of reading rush plays to stop damphousse , verbeek said , the rangers must deny him the puck more defensemen brian leetch and jeff beukeboom were victimized by the crisscrossing , droppassing , movingscreen style of the montreal forwards leetch said they discussed meeting the rush before it reaches the blue line to try to force offsides whistles but this takes quick thinking and movement they do n't give you much chance to look the other way and say , 'i got this guy , ' leetch said over all , leetch added we 're happy with this team we feel confident we played a good game for the first time in 10 days it s not a win , but it s a step in the right direction photo vincent damphousse , no 25 , celebrating with valery bure afterdamphousse s overtime goal gave canadiens a 32 victory over rangers \( associated press \)
in many ways , the university of connecticut and the university of massachusetts have been two of a kind they are new england landgrant colleges with spacious rural campuses an hour and a half from each other in the days when their men s basketball teams generally played modest regional schedules , they met 98 times , starting in 1904 but when uconn graduated from the yankee conference , joined the big east and became a national power , the series stopped then umass , which moved from the yankee conference to the atlantic 10 , became a power , too , and a public clamor began for the schools to renew the rivalry in one sense , the public will be served because the colleges will meet again , starting tonight at the hartford civic center in another sense , the joke is on the people who had hoped this matchup would produce a national champion while the young uconn team has a 62 record and a threegame winning streak , it is trying to integrate four new starters umass \( 46 \) is trying to overcome damaging injuries there were no such problems a year ago when the colleges decided to revive the rivalry umass was the nation s no 1 team and would reach the final four of the national collegiate athletic association tournament uconn would reach the final 16 umass had the player of the year in marcus camby , a 6foot11inch junior it had a bright young coach in john calipari uconn was ranked as high as no 3 in the nation and had a gamebreaker in ray allen , a 65 junior none of them will be there tonight calipari left umass to coach the nets camby and allen turned pro a year early umass still has edgar padilla and carmelo travieso , perhaps the best guard combination in the nation , but padilla is questionable because of a sprained ankle and leg contusion and travieso is trying to shake off back spasms that make breathing difficult when asked yesterday if he thought the minutemen would be pumped up , travieso , a senior , said definitely we were dying to play the game last year it s a little bit of a shame that it did n't happen calipari , who was succeeded by james \( bruiser \) flint , his assistant for seven seasons , said that the difficulties faced by umass this season had nothing to do with his departure everyone wanted a game , flint said yesterday they were in the top five we were in the top five and you always want to see who is the top team in the area i think the only thing that is lessened by playing the game this year is the lack of marquee names but in a couple of years , when these guys all get older , both teams will be back to being the two teams they were the last few years the marquee names being gone hurts there are a lot of new faces but interest in this game will grow as time goes on despite the reduced glamour , public interest in the game is high , and fewer than 2 , 000 tickets remain in the 16 , 000seat arena for the next four years , the annual series will rotate between the hartford civic center and the new fleet center in boston tickets are being split 5050 between the schools , guaranteeing a good pay night for both athletic departments , and large crowds seem assured while jim calhoun , the uconn coach , appreciated the ironies of the rematch , he said they did not matter we 've often said that the uconnumass rivalry would resume when it made sense to both programs , he said now is that time regardless of who is n't here and who is here it makes sense to start the rivalry again

having identified the woman who was beaten nearly to death in central park on tuesday , investigators said yesterday that they believed that her attacker did not know her and that he had robbed her in addition to trying to rape her after interviewing hundreds of people who had come forward to offer information on the case , detectives said that one of their strongest potential leads had come from a 19yearold college student and her younger sister , who said that a sketch of the attacker resembled a man who had lunged at one of them on sunday in the park near east 84th street the man was apparently scared away when he saw the second woman as the police continued their investigation , the victim s parents , who were on vacation in the west , arrived late last night at new york hospitalcornell university medical center , where their daughter was being treated the couple , who were met at the hospital by mayor rudolph w giuliani , were brought in through a back entrance and did not speak with reporters who were at the hospital earlier in the day , the police had reached the victim s two sisters and brought them to the hospital to make an identification they spent most of the day at their sister s bedside it was on thursday that the two women who told of being confronted by a man in the park reported their suspicion to the police that night , they were taken to the 20th precinct station house on west 82d street to view pictures of muggers and sex offenders yesterday , detectives took the pair to the spot in the park where they said the man had jumped out at them from bushes police officials also said yesterday that the beating victim s wallet had not been found in a search of her apartment on west 57th street , leading detectives to conclude that it had probably been taken in the attack detectives said that they were looking for anyone who might try to use the woman s credit cards but that no one had so far one investigator on the case who , like others , spoke on the condition of anonymity , said he believed strongly that the attacker s motive had primarily been sexual and that the robbery had been no more than an afterthought because the police have classified the attack as an attempted rape , they have asked news organizations not to release the victim s name witnesses and detectives have said that her top was ripped off and her skirt and underpants lowered several inches and that a small trace of semen was found on her clothing some law enforcement officials have said it is possible that the attack was not sexual that the semen was present before the assault and that her clothes were damaged during a struggle it does n't look like it was somebody she knew , but you could always be wrong , said one lawenforcement official in case the attacker did know her , investigators are going through the woman s address book , which was found in her apartment , and tracking down the people listed in it by late yesterday , the police had questioned more than 300 people arrested on unrelated crimes , hoping that one of them had heard something about the park attack more than 300 people have called the police to offer their help , including many who said they had seen someone resembling the man depicted in a police sketch that was released on thursday but detectives said there had been no strong suspects so far the chain of events that led to the identification of the woman began on thursday , when a woman could not find her piano teacher at the time of a scheduled lesson and became disturbed by a similarity between her teacher and the widely publicized sketch of the beating victim knowing that her teacher had once worked at the steinway sons piano store on west 57th street and still had many friends there , the woman went to the store patricia prudente , a saleswoman at the store who knows the victim , said of the student she had a look of fear on her face i saw it so we called 911 i was hoping it was n't her ms prudente and the piano student then went to the 20th precinct station house , where ms prudente was shown the composite sketch , which she had not yet seen she said she had immediately been sure that it was her friend that evening , the rev mike derkaloustin , a priest at st illuminator s armenian apostolic cathedral on east 27th street , went to new york hospitalcornell university medical center he said he thought he recognized the woman in the sketch as a former parishioner whom he had not seen in a year and a half , and he was right well after midnight thursday , the police took ms prudente and the piano student to the hospital , where they were also able to identify the victim it was just terrible , ms prudente said speaking about the attacker , she added , this person is a massive monster investigators said yesterday that some people who knew the beaten woman and were taken to the hospital later thursday night had been unable to identify her because her face was so disfigured the victim has lain comatose since tuesday afternoon , when she was beaten severely on the head , causing three skull fractures and a swelling of the brain that has necessitated surgery in a statement issued late yesterday , the hospital said her condition was still critical and lifethreatening the current theory is that the injuries came from him banging her head against the walkway , that there was no other weapon , a lawenforcement official said that could make the investigation more difficult because there would be no weapon from which to take fingerprints and no witnesses who might have seen the man discard the weapon investigators are pinning their hopes largely on someone recognizing the attacker from the sketch of a man who was seen having some kind of confrontation with the victim shortly before a professional dog walker found her , bleeding and unconscious , on a path near the western edge of the park at 82d street yesterday , the central park conservancy offered a 10 , 000 reward for information leading to the man s arrest and conviction , in addition to the 10 , 000 being offered by the city the police are trying to retrace the victim s movements on the day of the attack , but they have had little success so far the sketches of the woman and her attacker were compiled from the accounts of several witnesses some were nannies with children in a nearby playground about 30 feet south of the crime scene another was a man who saw them from his apartment window across central park west all the witnesses reported hearing shouting , and some said they had seen the man running away but it appears , from the statements of detectives and two of the witnesses , that none saw the actual attack and that none had realized until hours later that they had seen a serious crime in progress
east bernard , tex , april 2 tiger liked to hang out at koym field , home of the east bernard high brahmas , the backtoback class 2a texas baseball champions she made friends with the fans , watched the games and cadged some food every now and then that was until last month , when tiger s life came to a sudden and violent end three of the team s players stuffed her into a feed bag and took turns beating her with a baseball bat , and a fourth drove over her in his pickup truck then they threw her body into a creek bed and now that the four local teenagers have been arrested and charged with tiger s death , this farming community in southeast texas finds itself split by a smalltown debate over the crime though many here say it was not much of a crime at all and the punishment what should be done to these boys for killing a stray cat \? tiger was a 3yearold graystriped tabby , largely ignored in life but her death has made news across the state , become fodder for radio talk shows and generated considerable anger in different ways we 've gotten calls from all across texas , people who say these boys should be hung in the courthouse square , said sgt carlton hudgins of the wharton county sheriff s department , adding that he has been amazed by the reaction to the march 16 incident we 've worked homicides in this county , we 've had babies thrown in dumpsters by their parents , and we do n't get this response but others say those cries for justice are wildly out of proportion , perhaps scarring the boys for life over some saturdaynight mischief most of the town seems to have rallied behind the boys , and a wave of protest over the school superintendent s decision to oust them from the baseball team has turned savage in its own right two dead cats were dumped on the superintendent s front yard over the weekend the superintendent , nancy mcneal , overruled a plan by the high school s principal , jim bruce , to punish the boys by making them run 100 miles over a 30day period , which some said was hardly punishment at all since the boys were in training for the baseball season anyway a short walk up and down highway 90a , the main street here , reveals the cavalcade of emotions over the incident it was just a prank , a teenage act that got out of control , said 17yearold renae lozano , a classmate of the boys and a cashier at simple simon s pizza i do n't think it s a sign of how they 're going to grow up and treat other people but , said teresa davis , a day care worker who would like to see the boys severely punished it s horrifying if you take a cat and treat it like that , who knows how you 'd treat a little child \? pamela michulka , one of many people in town who used to care for tiger by offering her food , said she became sick to her stomach when she first heard of the incident i feel they need professional counseling , she said this could be an indication of possible future criminal behavior they need to figure out why they killed the cat and why they did it the way they did mrs michulka and her husband , charlie , a lawyer , called the sheriff and demanded an investigation into tiger s death sergeant hudgins said it took only a few hours to piece together details and obtain a remorseful confession from the four boys , as well as three others who took the carcass from the creek bed and threw it into the san bernard river in an effort to hide the evidence the incident apparently began after one of the boys became irritated when he saw tiger defecating on the baseball diamond it was just something that basically got out of hand , sergeant hudgins said the boys who killed the cat have been charged with cruelty to animals , a misdemeanor with a maximum punishment of a year in jail they are scheduled to appear in court on april 24 no charges who have been filed against the three who tried to hide the evidence while the incident has been offered in some news accounts as a chilling symbol of the depravity of today s youth , others say that it happened in the past but that nobody thought that much about it i was talking to guys at work about this , said james ryza , a machinist at a sugar plant , and some of them said they did things to cats when they were young that would make these kids look like angels calvin hillman , a butcher at kovasovic s meat center , said everyone s done some crazy stuff when they were teenagers , but it does n't mean they were criminals the conflicting emotions have been on display in other ways at koym field , the ball park , someone spraypainted kill kickers , not kitties on the equipment shack the other night but at a game against nearby shiner , many parents and students showed up with tshirts that read , practice forgiveness mrs michulka said she and her husband had received dozens of letters and phone calls from local people who are angry at them for demanding the sheriff s investigation tiger s violent end has been compared to a widely reported incident last fall in which nearly a dozen east texas youngsters , 8 to 14 years of age , beat to death a 14yearold quarter horse , wilson boy , that was owned by the local football coach many of those boys had had previous problems with the law , and were placed in juvenile detention centers but none of the boys here have had such troubles before mrs michulka said she thought it would be fair if the boys were given some sort of deferred adjudication of their case , during which they would work in an animal shelter and receive psychological help a few here are calling for more stringent steps , but many others say the boys have shown contrition and have already been punished enough by all the attention the incident has generated and many say the teenagers should not have been ousted from the team it s too severe , said mr ryza , the machinist i hate to think what would have happened to me at that age if i could n't play sports if it had not been for my playing football , i doubt i 'd have ever finished high school on some level , of course , the conflicting feelings about the case seem to come down to just how much worth people assign to an animal the people most outraged over the death spoke of tiger in practically human terms and shuddered in thinking about her last few moments of life the people most outraged over the demonization of the boys said the whole incident was overblown and many emphasized that nobody actually owned the cat it s just ridiculous , said one of several men gathered for a lateafternoon beer at the s b driveinn , a local hangout all this over a damn cat , a damn stray photos tiger , the stray cat shown at left that was beaten to death on march 16 at a ball park in east bernard , tex , was remembered with bouquets , right , that were strewn at the ball park 10 days after her violent death \( associated press \)
houston , feb 22 kenny tavai was driving his delivery van down mockingbird lane in dallas on wednesday morning , and gordon hale 3d was headed the same way in his pickup truck when the vehicles grazed each other , causing minor damage to their sideview mirrors the two men stopped , and an argument ensued mr tavai yelled at mr hale and then started punching him through the open window of mr hale s truck mr hale drew a gun , according to the dallas police , and shot mr tavai in the chest mr tavai died a few hours later at parkland memorial hospital mr hale was legally carrying the gun under a new law that went into effect last month , allowing texans to carry concealed weapons for the first time in more than a century although mr hale , a 42yearold welding supply repairman , appears to have had no trouble with the police except for running a stop sign a few years ago , he now stands charged with murder for opponents of the new law , the shooting of mr tavai amounts to a literal confirmation of their prediction that the measure could turn a routine traffic accident into a deadly confrontation and they wasted no time in proclaiming mr tavai as the law s first victim and a martyr to the guncontrol cause unarmed , mr tavai had just moved to dallas from the pacific northwest , and was three days into his new job as a deliveryman for a messenger service if it were not for this wrongheaded legislation , kenny tavai would still be alive today , said jimmy dunne , a board member of texans against gun violence , a group that unsuccessfully tried to defeat the bill last year if there was n't a gun available , he added , they 'd have probably just gotten hoarse yelling at each other until they calmed down nearly 55 , 000 texans have completed applications for a permit to carry a gun under the new law all the applicants , including mr hale , are required to undergo a 10 to 15hour training class that includes sensitivity training and conflictresolution techniques specifically designed to prevent verbal arguments from turning into violent altercations the state curriculum is intended to teach people carrying guns to let their rational inner adult control impulses of the inner child who becomes angry and perhaps triggerprone in conflict situations the dallas police said mr hale , who received his training last october at a suburban firearms academy owned in part by a state representative who sponsored the new gun law , apparently ignored that part of the curriculum they said he drew his gun to use deadly force when there was no imminent threat of deadly force or serious bodily injury with no avenue of escape but mr hale s lawyer , vincent perini , said his client acted lawfully this guy went berserk , he said of mr tavai we 're not talking about something easy or that allows cool reflection the adrenaline is pumping you do n't know what he 'll do next for all you know he has a screwdriver in his pocket , a switchblade in his pocket you do n't know if he has a gun mr hale , who was released on 25 , 000 bond , refused to discuss the incident his father , gordon hale 2d , also declined to talk about the shooting , but said of his son in a telephone interview he s a good boy he never had a fight in his life and the elder mr hale said the shooting that was described in the police account , which was based on interviews with at least five witnesses one of whom had been sitting next to mr tavai in the delivery van did n't happen just like the police report said the righttocarry law , echoing similar measures adopted in at least a dozen states in recent years , was passed last year with the strong backing of the governor of texas , george w bush proponents of the law maintained that it would make texans safer and give them a chance to defend themselves against criminals , and that predictions of otherwise harmless arguments turning deadly were overblown in florida , which has had a similar law since 1987 , the state has revoked the licenses of 58 people for illegal shootings not necessarily fatal of other people , said marilyn thompson , assistant director of the florida division of licensing none of those occurred after traffic accidents we have no history on that , she said whether wednesday s shooting in dallas will provide any significant momentum for guncontrol proponents to overturn the new texas law is unclear but it has put legislative sponsors of the measure in a defensive mode , at least for the moment state representative ray allen of grand prairie , part owner of the academy for firearms training , where mr hale underwent his training , issued a fullpage fax listing all the training that mr hale received it would be highly improper and grossly unfair to all parties concerned to comment further on this matter now before the grand jury , mr allen concluded after the jury finishes reviewing the case , he said , then we will know who is the victim in this tragic event mr hale did not flee the guy who did the shooting was pretty distraught , michael robertson , a 36yearold designer , told the dallas morning news he just said , 'oh god , oh god ! ' a couple of times i told him , 'you did n't need to shoot him you could 've driven off , ' mr robertson added mr tavai , a samoanamerican , had just started working at marquis messengers inc , where a supervisor , steve schmidt , described him today as a teddy bear kind of guy whose employment check turned up excellent references the police say mr tavai had appeared to provoke the argument by shouting at mr hale and punching him in the face , neck and shoulders the single gunshot in return was unjustified , said sgt jim chandler a spokeswoman for the texas department of public safety said she could not specifically verify the assertion by mr hale s father that his son had nothing more serious on his record than a traffic infraction but she said the background search that resulted in his obtaining a license would have led to a denial of the license if the search turned up any felony or even a misdemeanor assault or disorderly conduct if he got a license that means all those things came back clear , said the spokeswoman , sherri deatherage green mr perini , mr hale s lawyer , said his client wanted to carry the gun because he drove an expensive truck with a lot of tools at all hours of the day in industrial areas he does n't want to get hijacked , mr perini said , adding that mr hale was a longtime employee of the arlingtonbased company he drives a truck that serves welders , mr perini said if you have welding machines in a plant and they go on the fritz , you call his company and they send out gordon hale , or someone else , to work on the machines
samuel a kirk , an immigrant homesteader s son who became so intrigued by his childhood experiences teaching illiterate farmhands to read that he went on to an acclaimed career as the father of special education , died on july 21 at his retirement home in tucson , ariz he was 92 dr kirk , who ended his career at the university of arizona , did his pioneering work as the founding director of the institute for research on exceptional children at the university of illinois , a position he held before and after serving as director of the federal office of education s division of handicapped children in 1963 and 1964 in an era when what is known by statute as free , appropriate public education for all children is a right mandated by federal law , it is easy to forget how things were when dr kirk began his professional career in 1929 recently graduated from the university of chicago , he became a counselor at an institution for mentally handicapped teenage delinquents in chicago and later at a training school near ann arbor , where he obtained a doctorate in clinical psychology from the university of michigan in 1935 there were some programs for the mentally retarded at the time , but they were often little more than custodial , and there were none for other children whose special needs had not even been recognized dr kirk s observations and insights at those early jobs informed his later research , which among other things led to his discovery that many failing students who were clearly not retarded nevertheless suffered from various neurological disorders and could be helped by specific regimens of training over the next 60 years dr kirk wrote so widely and so authoritatively on so many aspects of mental retardation and learning disorders and was responsible for so many innovations in diagnosis , training and social policy that it is not hard to understand why a former colleague , william c healey , once suggested he was the last of the great generalists in his field dr kirk s most influential pronouncement was a speech he delivered to an education conference in 1963 , when he coined and defined the term learning disabilities the speech had a galvanizing effect on his profession and social policy dr kirk , whose pioneering work had already earned an award from a kennedy family foundation , was named to the federal post by president john f kennedy , who had a sister who was mentally retarded although he is widely credited with laying the groundwork for laws requiring schools to provide help for children with learning disabilities , what many regard as dr kirk s most visionary contribution to public policy occurred in 1964 , when he persuaded the administration and congress to begin providing financing to train teachers to provide the expert help such children needed those who knew him longest suggested yesterday that for all dr kirk s accomplishments and for all the prominent educators he taught , he was merely continuing a childhood impulse one of nine children of lebanese immigrants descended from scottish crusaders , dr kirk was born on a wheat farm outside rugby , nd , and grew up on a farm across the canadian border it was there , his younger brother , victor , recalled yesterday , that on rainy days the farmhands who slept in the loft would shun the pool table in the barn and gather around his brother for lessons in reading he had patience , mr kirk said he had a knack for instruction in addition to his brother , of sacramento , calif , dr kirk is survived by his wife , winnifred a son , jerry , of dana point , calif a daughter , lorraine kirk of laguna beach , calif two sisters , hannah wilson of tucson and margie , of lethbridge , alberta , and a granddaughter , shenna fitzgerald of seattle
when she got the phone call a year ago , phyllis riggle of ojai , calif , was thoroughly fed up with scant returns on investments like money market funds yet ms riggle , who sells real estate , wanted a relatively hasslefree place to park her money so the call piqued her interest would she want to join a partnership that was operating a highly profitable business setting up 900 phone lines around the country \? because ms riggle had friends running successful 900 lines toll lines offering everything from psychics to computer support out of their homes , she eventually invested 10 , 000 in the partnership , american fortune 900 inc a year later , she has n't seen a penny in returns , she says , nor is it likely that she will soon last month , the federal trade commission went to court and shut down american fortune 900 , which had operated from an address in woodland hills , calif the ftc said that since the fall of 1994 the partnership had defrauded dozens of investors by misrepresenting the speculative nature of the business and the number of lines it had running regulators in eight states are also taking legal action against the company a lawyer for american fortune 900 did not return repeated phone calls seeking comment if american fortune 900 did defraud investors , it represents one of the newest wrinkles in telecommunications scams just a few years ago , these scams usually involved cellular lines or wireless cable operations but federal and state regulators say swindles involving the information superhighway changed course in 1995 to focus either on trying to get investors to join 900 partnerships or trying to sell them licenses for paging frequencies in 1995 , such scams were among the most common reported to the ftc last month , the agency , along with 20 state securities agencies , initiated legal action in about 50 cases involving both types of fraud allegations while no one knows how much investors have lost nationwide , officials in california alone began taking action in late january against offerings involving investments in 900 partnerships totaling 225 million why are the scams so popular now \? experts give a number of reasons pagers , for example , are growing in popularity , and not just for businesses and paging licenses unlike other licenses , which the federal communications commission doles out by lottery or at auction can be easily bought but the 900 business is also growing at a steady clip , with many numbers promoted on the world wide web these scams are simply following the headlines , said robert friedman , assistant director of the ftc s bureau of consumer protection rigid disclosure rules exist , but are often ignored for example , investors are typically told that after paying 1 , 000 to 12 , 000 for a paging license , they 'll be able to flip it sell it to a big paging operator , which will supposedly pay top dollar in michigan , a 50yearold lawyer who recently bought three paging licenses for 10 , 000 was told he could expect to quadruple his money he was also told that he could greatly increase the licenses' value by triangulating them , or buying three at a time close to one another in reality , the ready availability of licenses means there is virtually no secondary market moreover , federal communications commission rules bar applicants from obtaining licenses for speculation scams involving 900 numbers also tend to leave out important facts often , the partnerships boast of potentially astronomical annual returns like 250 percent while even successful 900 numbers typically return just 25 percent some partnerships try to entice investors to buy into programs in which lines are already up and running there are literally dozens , if not scores , of these partnerships that are essentially reselling '900' numbers , said mark plakias , a managing director at strategic telemedia , a manhattan research and consulting firm but industry experts say these programs are often me too lines operating in highly competitive markets , like those for psychic lines they provide very little value , mr plakias said the most fundamental deception these companies are practicing is to present the industry as a multibilliondollar , highgrowth , surefire investment , mr plakias said in fact , he estimates that the 900 industry will reach only 1 billion in billings over the next two years he put 1995 billings at 750 million and he says that 8 out of 10 lines eventually fail still , scam artists come up with new hooks many companies now try to sell investors virtually worthless extensions that piggyback onto existing numbers , mr plakias said , even though the extensions are difficult to use and cannot be reached with rotary phones industry experts say that both the paging and the 900 businesses are highly speculative , with investors losing money , more often than not but the businesses are typically presented by scam artists as lowrisk , highreturn investments ideally suited to investors who are inexperienced or who hold ira or keogh accounts
paris , oct 25 a section of paris animated by artists , tourists , and a spirit of fierce independence is now trying to bring back something it was famous for in roman times winegrowing there s still an urban vineyard in the district , montmartre , in a lot saved from developers nearly 70 years ago by the parisian artist francisque poulbot but until this year , the wine it produced was , as the resident winemaker , francis gourdin , put it , difficult to drink mr gourdin was hired two years ago by the vineyard s owner , the city of paris , and its municipal caretakers in the 18th arrondissement to try to make something potable out of what had been a thin , pinkish liquid with more diuretic than dietetic qualities his first effort , clos montmartre 1995 , looks invitingly like beaujolais all 850 halfbottles of it sold out at the annual grape harvest festival this month in front of and around the terraced hillside vineyard on the rue vincent , where the leaves on the vines mostly the gamay beaujolais variety are still gloriously aflame it was a real wine , for the first time , exulted valerie lovat , a permanent civil servant in the 19thcentury district city hall where clos montmartre is made , aged , and bottled by hand in the cellar the proceeds , about 30 , 000 , went as they do every year to provide meals for needy shutins and hospital patients and other acts of charity around the 18th arrondissement people who bought the 1995 vintage were asked to donate a minimum of 40 a bottle the 1996 vintage is still maturing inside a gleaming metal vat , not much bigger than a large washing machine , in the city hall cellar it s still quite acid , but i hope the second fermentation , if it ever gets started , will take care of that , mr gourdin said the other day after drawing off a bit of the new wine with a siphon and sampling it after the pucker factor is reduced , the liquid will go into oak barrels in the cellar , to be aged until bottling next spring the vineyard is on a northfacing slope , the worst possible situation for growing good wine grapes , mr gourdin said i thought i did pretty well last year just to get it to look like red wine mrs lovat said most of the buyers just wanted to do good by preserving social cohesion in what is one of the most picturesque and varied communities in paris montmartre is named after the hill that dominates it and , according to local tradition , got its name from the early christian martyrs , among them st denis , the first bishop of paris , beheaded at its foot around 250 ad legend has it that st denis and his companions picked up their heads and walked with them about five miles north to his burial place , underneath the first gothic church built in france the feeling might not be unfamiliar to tourists who spend too many hours beguiled in the bars around the place pigalle , under the shadow of montmartre s dominant architectural feature , the neobyzantine sacrecoeur basilica , built in a sort of expiation after 20 , 000 people died in the repression of the paris commune in 1871 the neighborhood is still rebellious the deputy mayor for the 18th arrondissement , daniel vaillant , was one of the few socialists elected in the city in the vote in june of 1995 last summer , in one of the district s densest north african quarters \( the drop of gold neighborhood , named after the white wine from another , sincedisappeared vineyard \) , resident artists and intellectuals surrounded a church to try to protect the illegal immigrants occupying it from being arrested and expelled from france by the police the police eventually moved in , but almost all the immigrants were later freed and most of them are still in the country the vineyard on the other side of the slope started off in 1929 as the square of liberty , named by poulbot and the other artists who saved it as an open space for the republic of montmartre , which they had proclaimed to protest the poverty and neglect of the people with whom they shared the neighborhood poulbot , a painter of street children and an illustrator of children s books , also paid for many of his meals at the pomponnette restaurant , down the rue lepic from the more famous moulin de la galette , by painting frescoes and murals that are still on the smokestained walls mrs claude moureau , a greatgrandchild of the pomponnette s owners in those days , lamented the neighborhood is n't as steady as it was the shops are changing owners too often , and the hawkers i remember as a kid , people who used to come around selling vegetables and fruits in wheelbarrow carts , disappeared about 15 years ago the little grocery store around the corner on the rue tholoze was recently replaced by a domino s pizza outlet , and chic offices and boutiques have begun sprouting where bistros used to be mrs moureau serves none of the local wine in her restaurant , but neither does anybody else it s made to be collected , not drunk , said jacqueline lepechoux , a local art historian photo a vineyard grows in the montmartre section of paris , tended by francis gourdin , who seems to be having more success than his predecessors \(

east rutherford , nj , oct 2 when michael brooks joined the giants three years ago , he was n't exactly the friendliest of teammates brooks was n't sure how he would be received after joining the team as a free agent from the denver broncos so , to be on the safe side , for much of that season and on occasion after that , he kept a loaded gun in his locker at giants stadium that s right , a loaded gun according to some teammates who knew about it , brooks , who joined the detroit lions this season and was later cut , kept it in a bag in the back of his locker apparently none of the coaches knew , but many of the players did so much for team unity but unity was not a word used a lot in the giants' locker room last year or , even , several years ago now , unity seems to be the word of the season i think this group is very , very close , linebacker corey miller said in other words , no swapping stories about guns players enjoy each other s company combine that with the fact that the defensive coordinator mike nolan has devised the most aggressive schemes he has ever used since coming to the giants in 1993 and it is easy to see why in the last two games the defense has been so dominant players believe wholeheartedly in the system ok , ok , so one of those two games was against the jets but there is no way to explain away the minnesota game the giants dominated the vikings' offense , confusing and even rattling one of the best pure passers of the last 20 years in warren moon the giants have not allowed an offensive touchdown in eight straight quarters quite an improvement from the beginning of the season when teams were able to move the ball at will new york has allowed opponents inside the 20yard line only twice in the past two weeks with both penetrations leading only to field goals in the first three games opponents averaged averaged four trips a game inside the red zone in the past two weeks the giants' defense has given up only two runs longer than 10 yards \( the jets' adrian murrell had a 13yarder and minnesota s robert smith had a 28yarder \) that compares to at least 10 times in the first three games the giants have also given up only one passing play of more than 20 yards in the past two weeks \( moon to jake reed for 23 yards \) , compared to 12 such plays in the first three games why the big difference \? there are three main reasons first , nolan has been more aggressive he has probably used more corner blitzes in these five games than ever corner jason sehorn has been the biggest beneficiary with three sacks and two forced fumbles which leads to the second point nolan has done a good job of using personnel , something he sometimes has not done well in the past in the first game of the year he blitzed linebacker corey miller a lot , which is miller s strength in the jets game he used seven defensive backs for much of the second half he has rotated defensive linemen to keep them fresh third , the kicking game has helped punter mike horan s 10 kicks inside an opponent s 20yard line is first in the league the stat is important to the defense because it always helps when an offense is pinned deep there is nothing more satisfying for me to get one inside the 10 and have our defense force an offense to go three downs and out , horan said it was thought coming into this season that the offensive line would be the team s strength and that the defense , which is very young , would be the weak link there are all kinds of questions , so i do n't think there is any way you look at your defense and say , 'yeah , you thought this was going to be a strength , ' giants coach dan reeves said reeves added i think there were too many questions there , and we 're still a long way from being where we want to be the thing is they 're playing hard and i think our coaches are doing a good job of putting them in the right places and giving them some things that are giving some people some problems extra points when the former giants and current arizona quarterback kent graham was released by dan reeves two years ago and replaced by tommy maddox , privately many giants scouts and people in the front office were not happy now that maddox is out of the league and graham was named player of the week wednesday , some of those people are saying , i told you so graham completed a careerbest 37 of 58 passes for 366 yards , 4 touchdowns and no interceptions in arizona s 3128 overtime victory over the st louis rams at one point in the first half , graham completed 14 consecutive passes
chanhassen , minn paisley park , the studio complex prince built in this minneapolis suburb , is abuzz on a 10 , 000squarefoot sound stage , workmen are rolling white paint onto a huge runway of a set , preparing it for a video shoot later in the day in a mirrored studio down the hall , two dozen dancers are rehearsing upstairs , an olympic gymnast , dominique dawes , is trying on a wispy lavender costume a sound engineer is editing a promotional cd a graphics artist is putting the final touches on a logo through it all strolls the man in charge , attentive to every detail a hole in the gymnast s leotard \? a bit of choreography that needs broadening \? as songwriter , video director and recordcompany head , he takes responsibility for everything , makes all the final decisions and could n't be happier about it the 38yearold musician who now writes his name as a glyph is gearing up for the release on tuesday of emancipation , a threecd , 36song , threehour album intended to return him to superstardom over a recording career that stretches nearly two decades , the musician who was born prince rogers nelson earned a reputation for unorthodox behavior long before he dropped his name just in time for the musicvideo explosion , he invented himself as a largerthanlife figure a doeeyed allpurpose seducer for whom the erotic and the sacred were never far apart outlandish clothes , sculptured hair and seethrough pants made prince a vivid presence , but behind the costumes was one of the most influential songwriters of the 1980 s he toyed with every duality he could think of masculine and feminine , black and white , straight and gay while he made albums virtually by himself , like an introvert , his concerts were in the grand extroverted tradition of rhythmandblues showmen like james brown his music pulled together rock and funk , gospel and jazz , pop ballads and 12bar blues his most distinctive rhythm a choppy , keyboarddriven funk has permeated pop , hiphop and dance music , while his ballad style echoes in hits like tlc s waterfalls his only guide seemed to be a musicianship that drew admiration from many camps peter sellars , the revisionist opera director , once compared prince to mozart for his abundant creativity yet for much of the 1990 s , the quality of his output has sagged a result , he says , of his deteriorating relationship with his longtime record company , warner brothers he s one of the greatest ones , says george clinton , himself an architect of modern funk he s a hell of a musician he has really studied everything and he s working all the time even when he s jamming he s recording that he gets to party he listens to everything on the radio he goes out to clubs , and then he goes to the studio and stays up the rest of the night working he has more stuff recorded than anybody gets to hear sometimes i think he puts too much effort into trying to take what s out now and put his own thing on it to me , ai n't none of the pop stuff happening that s half as good as what he can do emancipation is a makeorbreak album it will inaugurate a new recording deal with a gambit that may turn out to be bold and innovative or utterly foolhardy will the 3cd set be received as an act of generosity or a glut of material \? for a major performer in the 1990 s , releasing a threecd set of new material is unprecedented even double albums are rare and commercially risky and emancipation is financed and marketed by the songwriter himself all the stakes are higher , he says as he picks a few berries from a plate of zabaglione in the paisley park kitchen but i'm in a situation where i can do anything i want his day s project is to direct the video for the first single from emancipation , a remake of the stylistics' 1972 hit betcha by golly , wow at the same time , he s making lastminute marketing decisions and doing a rare interview ever the clotheshorse , he s wearing a long , nubby grayandblack sweater and a shirt with lace tights a chevron is shaved into his hair next to one ear , with glitter applied to it cleareyed and serious , he speaks in a low voice , in a conversation that veers between hardheaded practicality , flashes of eccentricity and professions of faith in god he is businesslike one moment the next , he invokes his selfmade spirituality , in which musical inspiration and carnality are both links to divine creativity for all the music he has put out since the first prince album in 1978 , he has remained private the songs on emancipation take up his usual topics sex , salvation , partying all night long along with new ones like cruising the internet but a few have hints of the personal on valentine s day he married mayte garcia , who had been a backup singer and dancer in his band a few months ago , he announced that she was pregnant and that the child was due in november since then he has refused further comment i'm never going to release details about children , he says they 'll probably name themselves
taba commune , rwanda she was the only tutsi left living on a hillside in murehe township when the genocide ended two years ago so when savina mukacyibibi was beaten and strangled to death recently , it sent chills through the few tutsi survivors left in this hilly commune of banana groves , coffee trees and neat brick houses the killing was the first in taba commune since thousands of hutu refugees , some of them war criminals , began pouring back into rwanda from camps in zaire in november the local authorities say the killing was probably the work of hutu militants who wanted to silence mrs mukacyibibi , 50 , and prevent her from identifying those who killed her husband and five children the next day , tutsi soldiers arrested five local hutu men who had been at the social club with her before the killing but the police acknowledge they have no hard evidence against the men the killing of mrs mukacyibibi and the arbitrary arrests afterward reflect an ugly reality of life in rwanda as hutu refugees begin to arrive home behind the facade of pastoral peace , there is an uneasy balance of terror in the countryside members of rwanda s tutsi minority say they are terrified hutu militants will kill them , especially now that militiamen from the hutu majority who carried out the mass killings of tutsi in 1994 are drifting back home some tutsi have abandoned their houses and are banding together in trading centers we fear tomorrow it could be us , said steria mukankusi , 60 we are very worried about the returnees on the other side of the ethnic divide , hutu people , who dominated the government here for three decades before losing power to a tutsi rebel army , say they are now living in what amounts to a police state hundreds of hutu men have been hauled off in the night by tutsi soldiers and locked up in overcrowded jails without ever facing their accusers or having a chance to defend themselves their wives are often left floundering in poverty wherever a hutu is , he thinks he s going to be thrown in prison , said peragia mukantabiera , whose husband was jailed in march none of this bodes well for rwanda s attempts to knit itself back together after the massacres of 1994 , in which 500 , 000 tutsi and moderate hutu were killed by hutu militiamen and soldiers hundreds of thousands of hutu who fled the country after the tutsi rebel army defeated the hutuled government are coming home now , having been ejected from zaire by tutsiled rebels and from tanzania by tanzanian troops but they are entering a society polarized by fear and vengefulness all along the dirt roads and paths of the taba commune , in its bars and stores and butcher shops , hutu and tutsi treat each other with brittle civility but in private , many say the hatred that led to the events of 1994 has only deepened since the refugees began to return some say it is only a matter of time before that enmity will erupt again i am living with the hutu and we talk when we are together , said gatalina mukafurere , a 53yearold tutsi woman whose husband and three children were slain when you live with someone , you have to talk to them but at night i start thinking about my family , thinking about how i'm living by myself , when i had a wonderful family , and that is when i start hating them myself , i think it s going to take a while before we have peace closed community a rolling farmland monitored by spies set in rolling hills of banana and coffee about 11 miles west of rwanda s capital , taba is a sprawling green and fertile agricultural community along its reddirt roads , women in colorful kerchiefs shell piles of runner beans in front of small brick houses with tin roofs ground coffee , peas and cassava are spread on grass mats to dry in the bright sun rwandans do not live in the tightly clustered villages that dot much of africa instead , they are fanned out across the countryside in hundreds of tiny farms , linked by dirt paths and gravel roads every inch of available land is cultivated , and each family enjoys a relatively private domain a house , a garden , a couple of acres of farmland in some ways , the commune is an african version of american suburbia , with banana groves and beanfields replacing the lawns and pools but despite its rustic character , the taba commune is meticulously organized , with a rigid hierarchy of state officials reaching down to every level the commune is broken down into nine sectors , each headed by a councilor the sectors are in turn broken down into dozens of cells , presided over by officials known as responsibles , who report up the line to the councilors and the mayor each cell leader also employs a network of local volunteers to keep an eye on crime even in the most remote parts of the taba commune , a stranger is likely to be stopped and asked for his credentials by one of these socalled security officials , who then follow the intruder around and eavesdrop on his conversations today nothing can be done in a commune without permission from the mayor s office , which has a garrison of tutsi soldiers to enforce its edicts
when susan buzaid was a little girl in new milford , every summer her best friend , tammy schultz , had a visitor from new york city the three girls would run through the grass , swim and picnic , sit and talk together , for hours at a time her name was ruthie and i 'll never forget her she was very smart and very street smart and we were kind of naive country girls in this small town , mrs buzaid said she was part of our lives every summer from when she was about 7 until she was 13 or 14 and we learned a lot from each other the years passed and when mrs buzaid had two daughters of her own and they became schoolaged , she knew she wanted to share her home with a child as part of the fresh air fund program , to give her daughters some of what she had with ruthie for the third summer now , susan and her husband , jay buzaid , and their daughters lindsay , 8 , and samantha , 5 , of redding , will get a visit from gillian ferebeecoppage , 7 , who lives in the bronx she first visited the buzaid family when she had just turned 6 we were waiting for her bus and we 'd made this little 'welcome ! ' sign and we had no idea what she was like and this beautiful , tiny little girl gets off the bus and she smiled and you just wanted to grab her and hug her , mrs buzaid said i know it was very overwhelming for her at first , to be away from her mother and to be in the country with people she did n't know and , indeed , gillian said , i was scared at first i was homesick there was much to get used to the chirp of crickets for instance the noise of a city did n't bother her at all but the crickets frightened her , mrs buzaid said we had to go out into the yard and show her them , that it was ok although gillian s still not enthusiastic about bugs , she adjusted to life in redding rather quickly and soon enough she and lindsay and samantha became friends they played hopscotch gillian taught lindsay and samantha lots of songs for jump rope , lindsay said and samantha taught gillian how to jump into the water swimming turned out to be one of gillian s great joys the buzaids belong to a club with a pool and have a family home on candlewood lake as well as a family place on the ocean in newport , ri mrs buzaid signed gillian up for swimming lessons but she also learned from paddling around with samantha , an avowed water rat i like the pool best , gillian said i like getting on the board and kicking my feet and i eat grilled cheese for lunch at the pool mrs buzaid said they 're hard pressed to get gillian to leave the pool we 'll be there for , like , eight hours and she still wo n't want to go home , she laughed over two summers the girls have forged a close friendship they 're nice , gillian said i like a lot of things about her , lindsay said there are so many things i ca n't think of just one but then she and samantha think of a couple of things they like best about gillian her braids and her great giggle gillian is just one of 10 , 000 new york city children who take part in fresh air fund programs annually boys and girls from 6 to 18 visit 300 fresh air friendly towns in the summer and more than 60 percent visit the same family year after year the children usually stay for two weeks at a time mr buzaid said he takes at least one day off during the time gillian visits so they can all have a long weekend away we do n't change our summer routine much we go to the lake and we 'll all go boating , rafting , swimming , he said we get a lot of satisfaction out of having her here the kids get along and they look forward to seeing her each year the buzaids have a large family teeming with cousins , and gillian has become a part of it and part of the neighborhood as well , attending barbecues , going out for pizza , taking family vacations she becomes part the household , sharing in chores and family rules each afternoon the girls have some quiet time , each in her own room they become like sisters and they can all use a little space after a while , mrs buzaid explained gillian s a very bright girl and her mother wants her to read each day gillian learned of some of the buzaid family traditions and she taught the buzaids about some of hers how all of sunday is spent at church , how she too has the support of a closeknit family still , their worlds are a contrast gillian lives in the bronx with her mother , cheryl ferebee , and uncle mrs ferebee said that down the street from their apartment are housing complexes where drug dealing is commonplace once , she said , when she and gillian were leaving gillian s grandmother s house , there was gunfire on the street , which made gillian afraid to go to her grandmother s at night for a while she does n't play outside much she skates in the hallway of her apartment building at the buzaids' house , she has her own room , with two window seats where she likes to curl up and read books while looking outside at deer , birds , even coyotes the home is sprawling , with a huge kitchen designed by mr buzaid , who owns powerhouse appliances in new milford and designs kitchens in the living room , a stone fireplace travels up to the ceiling from widebeamed hardwood floors the girls have a lot as well all the american girl dolls and shelves full of books , but none of it fazes gillian , mrs buzaid said
moscow , march 1 in a quest for political resurrection , mikhail s gorbachev , the last leader of the soviet union , said he will be a candidate in the presidential elections in june if democrats fail to unite behind a single candidate in my heart , i am prepared for that , mr gorbachev said of his candidacy but he stressed that before formally announcing it , he first wanted to try to persuade all democratic political parties to nominate an alternative to president boris n yeltsin and his communist challenger , gennadi zyuganov a scenario of the choice of the lesser evil is being imposed on the public , mr gorbachev said as if there were no other political forces capable of contending for victory except the 'party of power' and the communists ever since he resigned from office after the soviet union collapsed in 1991 , mr gorbachev , who will turn 65 on saturday , has been struggling to wriggle free of his forced retirement , giving speeches , issuing policy papers , performing campaignstyle stops in the provinces , and last year , publishing a twovolume autobiography for the past two years , he has publicly flirted with the idea of running against his rival , president yeltsin but mr gorbachev , who is widely blamed by russians for the collapse of the soviet empire , does not have a large constituency of supporters begging him to get into the race the newspaper nezavizimaya gazeta publishes a monthly list of the 100 most influential political figures in russia in the february list , published today , mr gorbachev was ranked 93 though still revered in the west as the man who ended the cold war and tried to reform the corroded soviet system , at home mr gorbachev is viewed as the man who precipitated its demise his efforts to halt the arms race won him the nobel peace prize in 1990 a year later he was almost ousted in a hardline communist coup , and never recovered his hold on power none of the democratic leaders he reached out to today responded to his announcement mr gorbachev expressed withering contempt for his longtime nemesis , saying mr yeltsin had used democracy and the democrats as a cover for creating an oligarchic regime he was no less scornful of mr zyuganov , who was one of the hardliners in the central committee of the communist party who opposed mr gorbachev s reforms in the late 1980 s a victory by mr zyuganov , mr gorbachev said , would deliberately or inadvertently pave the way to nationalsocialism in russia
riverhead , li , sept 24 a pool mechanic s failure to install a 144 piece of exhaust pipe helped cause the death of the tennis star vitas gerulaitis from carbon monoxide exposure , prosecutors charged today as the mechanic went on trial the mechanic , bartholomew torpey , is charged with criminally negligent homicide in the death of mr gerulaitis , who was 40 when he died two years ago while sleeping in a pool house on the southampton estate of a friend , martin raynes it was carbon monoxide from the improperly installed heater that caused vitas gerulaitis s death , said the prosecutor , edward heilig , in his opening statement here in suffolk county criminal court vitas gerulaitis never woke up because of this man s criminal negligence another two feet of plastic exhaust pipe worth 144 would have properly vented the heater , the prosecutor said instead , he contended , the pipe installed by the defendant was too short to reach the outside of the pool house , causing carbon monoxide to pour into an enclosed basement area and then be recirculated through the pool house by airconditioning equipment mr heilig said mr torpey and the company he worked for , east end pools and courts , also known as recreational concepts of sag harbor , li , were aware of the risks of faulty installation , but did nothing about it the pool company is also a defendant in the trial , charged with criminally negligent homicide , but none of the company s owners or other workers were charged mr heilig said that three days before mr gerulaitis s death , mr torpey and the pool company had been warned by james cosmano , a representative of the company that made the 8 , 000 heater , teledyne laars , that the installation was wrong and needed to be corrected immediately mr heilig said that both mr cosmano and mr torpey got dizzy and lightheaded from the carbon monoxide fumes while inspecting the heater in the basement of the pool house on sept 15 , 1994 but did mr torpey do anything to fix it \? mr heilig said no , he does nothing he just does n't care mr cosmano was granted immunity when he testified before a grand jury that indicted mr torpey and the pool company john m o'brien , mr torpey s lawyer , told the jury that his client was being used as a scapegoat he s the fall guy for what everybody else did wrong in this case he said mr raynes was using the pool house as an illegal dwelling , a twobedroom condominium for his guests to stay in while they visited his fiveacre beachfront estate he said mr raynes had been told by southampton village officials that the pool house could not be used for overnight guests , yet no criminal charges were brought against him david a clayton , the lawyer for the pool company , insisted that the heater s exhaust pipe , as installed several months earlier , extended to the appropriate length he said that 15 people had been guests in the pool house before mr cosmano s inspection and that no harm had come to them but three days after the teledyne representative comes and does things to this machine , vitas gerulaitis dies , mr clayton said they let the big people go and made my client the scapegoat , he said if convicted , mr torpey , who is 34 and lives in sag harbor , faces a maximum penalty of one and onethird to four years in prison the pool company faces a fine of up to 10 , 000 while not named in any criminal action , mr raynes , as well as teledyne laars , recreational concepts and mr torpey are among the defendants named in a 63 million wrongful death civil suit brought by mr gerulaitis s family
palo alto , calif , march 22 it pays to treat computers politely they can be jerks and bullies but they can also be friends and teammates , and their praise is high praise indeed if all that makes perfect sense to you , then you , too , suffer from what two stanford university professors believe is a universal syndrome the practice of perceiving machine as man , of reacting to your laptop almost as if it is a little person sitting on your knees byron reeves and clifford nass of stanford s center for the study of language and information sum up the results of 35 studies they have done , in the following academese individuals interact with communications technologies in fundamentally social and natural ways then they translate people know intellectually that the glowing screen before them is not flesh and blood , but viscerally their ability to distinguish between another person and a languageusing machine remains faulty at a very basic level , there s no switch in the brain that turns one way to media and one way to real life , professor reeves said the two have found that , for example , people are polite to computers when they are asked to evaluate a computer s performance , they tend to assess the one they are using more positively than others just as people tend to praise other people more to their faces than behind their backs people also swell with pride when flattered by computers , the professors have found , even when they have been told the praise is random and when a computer uses a female voice , people tend to perceive it as more nurturing , while male voices are seen as having more authority on technical matters another study determined that people with dominant personalities tend to like a computer that uses assertive language in its onscreen messages , thus coming across as another dominant personality , while submissive people tend to like submissivesounding computers that instead of dictating , query tentatively , what about maybe trying it this way \? these studies and others like them are to be published in august by cambridge university press in a book titled the media equation how people treat computers , television and new media as real people and places these responses to computers as beings , the professors say , are almost unconscious no one thinks they 're doing these things , professor reeves said none of the people say , 'of course i was being polite to the computer' professor nass , who is 38 , came from the world of hardcore computer science , and professor reeves , who is 46 , has a background in television they design their research by taking findings on persontoperson responses and testing whether they apply to persontocomputer interaction they use traditional psychological methods for measuring reactions , such as monitoring brain activity and skin response , as well as questionnaires there s 100 years of psychology research to steal , professor nass said , joking we 're busy as heck in one study they took psychology findings that people tend to react more positively to people they perceive as teammates and tried an almost laughably primitive experiment they put a prominent green frame around a computer , then gave some of their research subjects green armbands and some blue those with green armbands assessed the computer more favorably the point of all this research , apart from casting light on some fascinating aspects of how the brain deals with technology , is to provide fundamental guidance to computer and software designers such simple findings as the powerful effect flattery has on a user , professor nass said , have implications for programs like spellingcheckers instead of only criticizing spelling , they might do well to praise users for getting a lot of words right from time to time more broadly , the research might help computer makers design the right types of virtual personalities to appeal to buyers , developing computerized allies that may someday soon be reminiscent of hal , the deepvoiced computer companion in 2001 a space odyssey if you think of hal as the holy grail , professor reeves said , you really do have a good abbreviation of where we think it s going drawings
the last of the savages by jay mcinerney 271 pages alfred a knopf 24 it s not hard to see the ghosts of famous classics lurking behind jay mcinerney s trendy novels bright lights , big city and ransom reverberated with echoes of the sun also rises , while story of my life tried hard to affect the chatty nonchalance of the catcher in the rye this time , the models appear to be fitzgerald s great gatsby and this side of paradise to get a sense of what the last of the savages is like , think of gatsby with a couple fundamental changes of cast gatsby as a rich , music business tycoon who s almost perpetually stoned nick carraway as a closeted homosexual , in love with the gatsby character and obsessed with the monied world of the status quo mr mcinerney s narrator his carraway , as it were is a new york lawyer named patrick keane , who is looking back on his life from the vantage point of middle age in particular , he is looking back on his lengthy friendship with will savage , his prepschool roommate , who went on to become a famous record producer the two men are polar opposites , though both are described as complete products of class patrick , who s desperate to escape his lowermiddleclass background , is a willful conformist he works hard as a scholarship student at boarding school he works hard at cultivating a proper preppie image he works hard to get into yale college and harvard law school , and he works hard to become a partner at a whiteshoe law firm he s the sort of guy who makes carbon copies of his letters to his friends , the sort of guy who has to be told about the sexual aspect of rockandroll even during the social upheavals of the 60 s and 70 s , patrick pictures himself \( or would like to picture himself \) as a kind of jeffersonian gentleman with a book in one hand and a riding crop in the other will , in contrast , is the selfhating scion of an aristocratic southern clan , a passionate rebel who does everything he can to earn the wrath of his conservative father he makes a small fortune as a schoolboy by running numbers and spends his free time imbibing every chemical substance known to man instead of going to college , he translates his love of black music into a lucrative career , and much to his family'p chagrin , marries a beautiful black singer he builds a fantastic , gatsbyesque mansion in memphis , helps bankroll george mcgovern s presidential campaign and founds various charities to give his money away patrick and his friends k'ep describing will as some kind of outlaw genius , as a man to whom the words myth and legend just naturally adhere , and yet the reader is never made to experience his magic he just seems like a moody kid with a big trust fund who grows up to become a moody grownup with money \( and money problems \) of his own descriptions of will s musical expertise feel synthetic and forced reports of his legendary high jinks , like getting into a pillpopping contest with jimi hendrix and getting tossed out of the ritzcarlton for busting up some furniture , also feel oddly secondhand as for the narrator , patrick , he s a recognizable mcinerney type the boyish picaro , groping around for an identity and mesmerized by the glamorous world around him mr mcinerney has concocted an engaging voice for patrick and uses his own keen eye for social detail to imbue patrick s reminiscences with a nicely tactile gleam unfortunately , patrick lacks the charm and selfawareness possessed by the heroes of bright lights and ransom , and his groveling pursuit of bourgeois comfort and conformity severely try the reader s sympathy unlike fitzgerald s narrator , patrick possesses no moral authority , no moral weight as a result , we 're disinclined to trust him as a narrator , or accept his descriptions of will or anyone else as related by patrick , the central concerns of savages are familiar adolescent ones how to rebel against your family , how to win friends and influence your classmates , how to strike a balance between the imperatives of freedom and the demands of parents , teachers and bosses the same questions have animated earlier mcinerney novels here , the backdrops have simply been changed from new york and kyoto to memphis and new haven in order to broaden these comingofage quandaries and make savages seem like a larger novel , mr mcinerney has tried to turn the story of will and patrick into an emblematic saga in a youthful letter to will , patrick writes , you and james brown and norman o brown are avatars of the same weltanschauung and you seem to be slipping it over on the rest of us while will is supposed to spmbolize the anarchic impulses of the 60 s counterculture , his father , cordell savage who will ominously suggests has ties to james earl ray and assorted arms dealers is portrayed as a symbol of the south s confederate past patrick , on his part , is presumably meant to be an avatar of 80 s materialism and acquisitiveness by the end of the book , he has ridden the wave of mergers and acquisitions to a nineroom apartment on park avenue and has entered into a cosmetic marriage with a pretty yuppie none of these efforts to open out the last of the savages really work references to the assassination of the rev dr martin luther king jr , glimpses of the black panthers in new haven and talk about the war in vietnam all feel perfunctory and contrived , as do the allusions to the savage family s sordid past , its involvement in the persecution and murder of slaves in the end , then , we are left with the flimsy story of two boys with poor selfesteem a rich boy who wants to disown his family and a poor boy who wants to be rich
atlanta michael johnson s olympic odyssey has been filled with remarkable feats , incredible performances and lessons along the way at the barcelona games in 1992 , johnson suffered a humiliating defeat in the 200meter qualifying round and learned the lesson of perseverance he vowed to become the first man to win the 200 and 400 meters in the same olympic competition , and for the next four years began a devastating march to atlanta he came to atlanta on the wings of his own speed and in the clouds of an intense advertising campaign that beamed his face into every household , plastered it on every billboard in this , the 60th anniversary of jesse owens s legendary performance at the 1936 berlin games , michael johnson was heralded as the next bearer of the torch , carrier of the flame last night , under a luscious full moon on a perfect night , johnson , who has called himself the story of the olympics , completed the first leg of his journey running at full throttle from start to finish , johnson won the 400meter race going away in an olympicrecord time of 4349 seconds but before the race even began , johnson s march to posterity was headed off by none other than carl lewis , the 35yearold long jumper whom most people including johnson had written off just before johnson took the stage for his 400meter race , lewis uncorked a dramatic leap to project himself to his ninth olympic gold medal his ninth in recent interviews , johnson has hinted that lewis seemed reluctant to pass the torch , and also seemed intent on holding on to a piece of the limelight for as long as possible after the 400 , a reporter asked johnson what he felt about another piece of history taking place , referring to lewis johnson remained silent for a few seconds it s great , he said i do n't think i 'll be able to get that many gold medals in my career i still hope i can do some things that have never been done johnson is a great athlete who turned in a great performance , but for the time being he does n't understand the difference between a legend and a star johnson is a star what he has failed to understand in the rush of hype and billboards is that lewis has earned his olympic spotlight he has made four olympic appearances won four gold medals in one olympics , 1984 won four gold medals in the long jump , and nine over all if the olympics teach nothing else , they teach the lesson of enormous capacity the games are large enough for numerous torch bearers lewis seems to understand this i do n't know what anyone has to do to pass the torch , he said after his victory there is no manual on this sport there is no such thing as socalled passing the torch we should celebrate everybody i do n't think we should be jockeying for one or two positions if i had n't set a standard , michael would n't be making the money he s making earlier in the afternoon , butch reynolds , the worldrecord holder in the 400 , said that johnson should expand his vision it s not just one torch , said ken griffey s not all baseball , michael jordan s not all basketball reynolds had hoped to be running in the 400 against johnson , but was sidelined by leg cramps in a semifinal heat sunday he said he would n't attend last night s race he did n't want to see johnson break his record when i asked him how he thought it would feel to lose his record , reynolds looked up from a trainer s table like losing a loved one , man that baby s been with me for eight years the baby is still his johnson fell short of the record but got his gold medal and for all of the publicity , all the notoriety , all the sensitivity to talk of lewis s accomplishments , johnson seems fairly well grounded he begins his quest for his second gold on thursday johnson allowed himself to savor the moment over the past years , every time i 've done something , the media asks , 'does this make up for '92 \? ' and i 've always said it has nothing to do with '92 , he said but going out there today and winning that gold medal made up for '92 i do n't think it s hit me that i'm finally an individual olympic gold medalist photo michael johnson \( barton silverman \)
rome , feb 24 pope john paul ii issued a new rule book on friday for how future popes will be elected , largely reaffirming existing guidelines but reinforcing the secrecy of the process and improving accommodations for the 100 or so cardinals who will come to rome to choose his successors at a news conference on friday , bishop jorge mejia , secretary of the college of cardinals , said the revised rules had been issued in part to take into account modern technological developments more sophisticated listening devices , he said , mean the vatican s walls are no longer insurmountable he said the new text bans all forms of communications between the secluded cardinals and the outside world in answer to reporters' questions , he said the timing of the new rules had nothing to do with the health of the 75yearold pope i can see the pope is in perfect health , bishop mejia said this document has nothing to do with that particular personal situation in past conclaves , cardinals were jammed into makeshift quarters scattered around the apostolic palace , where they were kept as virtual prisoners until the balloting for the new pope conducted under the michelangelo frescoes in the sistine chapel was over , and white smoke could be seen rising from a chimney above st peter s square in the future , the balloting will still take place in the sistine chapel , under the strict rules of secrecy , with the same twothirds majority of no more than 120 cardinals required for election one innovation will be in the comings and goings of the cardinals themselves , who have accommodations at the newly built st martha s residence several hundred yards from st peter s basilica the last election of a pope took place in october 1978 , when karol cardinal wojtyla from cracow , poland , became the first nonitalian in more than 500 years to be chosen as st peter s successor but it was the election of pope john paul i a month and a half before in august , at the height of a hot roman summer that vatican observers say brought home the inadequacies of the cardinals' cramped accommodations the new residence , shown on italian television , has none of the magnificence of the vatican itself where the cardinals ate and slept next to the masterpieces of the vatican s art collection if anything , the new rooms including 107 tworoom suites and 20 single rooms have the paneled look of a modern motel , except for the crucifixes and portraits of the pope hanging on the walls with voting sessions scheduled for both morning and afternoon , and a midday break for lunch , the cardinals will probably have shuttle vans available to take them back and forth to the sistine chapel in a change in voting procedures , the revised rules entitled universi deominici gregis , or the the shepherd of the lord s whole flock allow only written secret ballots , abolishing two rarely used and outdated methods that had been listed in previous documents one allowed for the election of a pope by acclamation , and the other allowed cardinals in the case of a deadlock to delegate their votes to small committees drawn from their own ranks in other respects , the updated rules carefully follow the traditional script , dictating when the conclave should begin \( no sooner than 15 days , and no later than 20 days after a pope s death \) , what the cardinals should wear \( the usual black cassock with piping and the red sash , with skullcap , pectoral cross and ring \) and what chant they should sing as they make their solemn procession from the pauline chapel to the sistine palace \( veni creator \) the last major changes to the election procedures were made in 1975 , when pope paul vi set the limit on the number of cardinalelectors at 120 , and established a rule that only cardinals under 80 years old may take part another change , instituted in 1945 , said the election of a pope requires a majority of twothirds plus one
cookie lorenzo and jim mcelroy remember when marine park , its 798 acres spilling out into rockaway inlet , was all swamp and elephant grass , without a baseball player in sight but it took no time after its northern end was filled in the late 1930 s before the sandy fields became a crucible of brooklyn baseball prowess wooden backstops seemed to sprout from the soil hundreds of boys with baggy homemade uniforms materialized to play on teams with names like the arrows and the cadets for many years , mr mcelroy said , you could n't fight your way onto a field on weekends sons of workingclass families , the players were tough and brimming with talent but both men said yesterday that they had never really seen young talent until the torre brothers of avenue t came along first rocco , who threw bullets and was destined for ebbets field before the navy called then frank , who once pitched a nohitter with his eyes almost swollen shut from allergies and finally joe , the most determined of the three though he was the pudgiest and slowest , built like a johnny pump , in the words of mr lorenzo , 79 , an amateur league official who umpired many of joe s games tonight , as the youngest torre brother is scheduled to go to his first world series and to take the new york yankees to their first in 15 years , many in the waterfront neighborhood feel as though he was taking them with him though one storied amateur team in marine park produced half a dozen major league players , it is joe torre s success , they said , that represents the pinnacle of their brooklyn sandlot tradition he is also the only manager born and raised in new york city to take a new york team to the world series , a fact that sweetens the local victory that much more he had me crying along with him the other night when they won the pennant , said george russano , whose two sons played with the yankees manager this is his time , so it s our time the neighborhood s baseball story was written by the italian , irish and jewish laborers who flocked there when the government decided to make the area the largest port in the world , a plan that fell apart during the depression but the families found other livelihoods , and men like mr lorenzo , a sanitation worker , and mr mcelroy , a commercial printer , spent almost as much time teaching boys to play baseball as they did at their jobs what it actually turned out to be was teaching them how to stay out of trouble and be good citizens , said mr russano , a father figure to joe torre , who still calls him pop if they turned out to be good ballplayers , that was icing the men formed the parade grounds league , so called because many championship games were played on the parade grounds south of prospect park and at the same time , a consolidated edison worker named dan hill put together the cadets , which won national championships in 1950 , 1951 and 1963 we were the yankees of the sandlot clubs , said mr mcelroy , who coached the cadets for 29 years the younger two torre brothers were the team s stars , frank at first base and pitching and , eight years later , joe , who also pitched and played first and third base rocco , who died of a heart attack in june , pitched for an earlier team called the arrows and was being scouted by the brooklyn dodgers before he entered the service and injured his arm the torre family , like most in the neighborhood in those days , was shaped by two dominant forces the catholic church and the national pastime , though not always in that order the family s redbrick house was only half a block from the ball fields , and across the ball fields was good shepherd catholic church , which their mother , margaret , made sure they found every sunday sister marguerite , a torre sibling who entered the ursuline order as her brothers were entering professional baseball , remembers that the lines between the two institutions were frequently blurry my mother was a fierce fan , she said she would sit at the games fiddling with a rosary in her hands and shooting dirty looks at anyone who got anything past my brothers she once criticized her daughter for bringing a group of nuns , who happened to be mets fans , to a mets game when joe was playing against them with the atlanta braves she said , 'why did you bring those nuns here to root against joe \? ' sister marguerite recalled i told her that they were rooting for the mets , not against joe , and she said , 'well , do n't bring them back again' sister marguerite , the principal at a catholic school in queens who attends as many of joe s games as she can , only recently learned that her brother had used a bit of his fame on her behalf heartbroken that his sister could not attend his new york games , he asked a friend who knew francis cardinal spellman to appeal for permission for his sister to leave her partial cloister on long island when he was playing in town , she said her mother superior refused , but she did allow sister marguerite to watch on television i did n't know about it , she said if i had i would have died i never asked for exceptions those who grew up with joe torre said they believe they can see in his management style more than a little of his mother s strict imprint \( she was divorced from joe s father , a police officer \) we grew up in a family where my mother made sure we ate a green vegetable , a red vegetable and yellow vegetable with every meal , said rae , the other sister , who still lives in the family s house in marine park it was strict but i think it was good for us joe , the baby of the family , also had his brother frank s almost obsessive love of baseball constantly before him both sisters said that frank could frequently be found in his room playing imaginary leagues whose statistics he kept in a ledger frank who is now waiting for a heart transplant at columbiapresbyterian medical center in manhattan would roll dice for plays , sister marguerite said , and you could hear him saying , 'going , going , going it s gone !

phoenix , nov 27 they could n't go 0 for the season but who would be their first victim \? they have to beat somebody , jayson williams said they 're not going to go 082 the nets forward was referring to the phoenix suns , who had begun the season 013 somehow , it figured victory no 1 would come against the nets wesley person , one of many underachieving suns , lighted up the desert tonight with 22 points to lead phoenix to an embarrassingly easy 9977 victory over new jersey \( 28 \) here tonight at america west arena the victory was danny ainge s first as head coach in his sixth attempt since taking over for cotton fitzsimmons and the nets did all they could to help ainge out the worst shooting team in the league coming into the game at 40 percent , new jersey shot 318 tonight in their first 13 games , the suns had held only one lead at the half it was 5044 phoenix after two quarters tonight the suns' biggest lead this season had been 9 points they eclipsed that early in the third quarter and coasted the rest of the way when you shoot 29 percent , you lose , nets coach john calipari said i could n't believe we were in it at halftime what it looked like was they wanted it more than we wanted it yes , the suns were playing with kevin johnson and john \( hot rod \) williams for only the second time this season it s not like we were playing a slouch team , calipari said yet this was also a team that had just set a club record for consecutive losses , a team that was four defeats shy of the national basketball association record for losses to open a season and that s not all the suns , one of the worst rebounding teams in the league , outrebounded the nets , the best in the league , by 4744 i would have expected us to play better tonight , calipari said but to be honest with you , we missed so many bunnies that you do n't know what the game would have been if we 'd just made some shots i'm not talking about sidewinding , fadeaway shots i'm talking about layups dead pointblank 8footers and we just missed them and missed them and missed them the nets' starting backcourt , kerry kittles and robert pack , went 3 for 20 over all backup guard khalid reeves was 1 for 7 williams , who had 12 points and 13 rebounds , was 5 for 19 the 7foot , 6inch center shawn bradley had 7 points and 4 rebounds one of the few bright spots was kendall gill , who led the nets with 18 points we 're not a good shooting team , calipari said when asked the reason for his team s poor shooting we are about where we thought we would be can you say rockbottom \? i do n't think it says we 're a terrible team , said pack , who was plagued by foul trouble i think we 're better than it showed tonight williams said i know they shocked themselves they were destined to win a game and we 're not a good road team what can i say \? it s frustrating it s frustrating to lose what can you do \? we have another game tomorrow before tonight , there had been little sunshine in the valley of the sun for the team that was arizona s first professional sports franchise , that instantly became phoenix s darlings , and that had spoiled its fans with years of good play maybe that is why the america west arena still sells out for each home game or why , a local radio personality lived in a makeshift van outside the arena the last week and a half , waiting for the suns to win so he could rejoin his wife and three kids the nets sent him home even with tonight s blowout , nobody here has ever seen anything like this season s 113 start by the suns take danny manning , whose knees have become a sort of symbol for the suns' decline manning played fiveplus seasons for the los angeles clippers , basketball s definition of hell and do n't think that the big , round guy who used to occupy the empty stall in the corner of the suns' room is n't feeling a little vindicated charles barkley , who had requested a trade , was sent to houston and now is playing alongside hakeem olajuwon and clyde drexler this is a phoenix suns team , after all , that had won 50 or more games seven times in a row before last season , when the suns went 4141 , but still qualified for the playoffs for the eighth consecutive season this is a franchise that , as recently as two seasons ago , was considered a legitimate contender to win the nba championship , something that has eluded it in its 29 years the fall has been fast most trace it to feb 6 , 1995 , when manning , a key freeagent signing , blew out his knee in practice no question about that , said jerry colangelo , the suns principal owner the suns were 3610 at the time they were two seasons removed from a championship series against the chicago bulls not everyone agrees that was the turning point kevin johnson points to the suns' loss in the 1993 finals to the bulls as the beginning of the end others talk of the departures of ainge and dan majerle \( an oct 7 , 1995 deal that brought hot rod williams , who has been pretty much injured since \) just one thing after another , the 37yearold ainge said bad breaks whatever the reason , the suns have lost any semblance of stability less than two weeks ago , ainge succeeded fitzsimmons , who stepped down with the suns 08 ainge had signed as an assistant with the understanding that he would become head coach next season , but the players were hearing two voices in fitzsimmons s words fitzsimmons had replaced paul westphal last jan 17 , with the suns five games under 500 colangelo had been unhappy with westphal s easygoing approach , especially toward barkley and johnson and there are those in the suns organization who blame westphal for trading majerle and a no 1 pick next summer to cleveland in little more than a season , then , three coaches and almost 30 players have graced the team s roster barkley was traded on aug 19 for chucky brown , mark bryant , sam cassell and robert horry the deal has worked out just fine for barkley not so for the suns , who have no interior defense and who have had nobody who can shoot , especially when johnson was out the first 11 games of the season sometimes i'm tempted , said ainge , who played three seasons here add to all that a tough earlyseason schedule , a totally revamped whoaretheseguys roster \( with 10 players in the final year of their contracts \) , no goto guy in the crunch and very little chemistry on or off the court to speak of , and how could the suns not have started slowly \? i look at this team and say it should n't be , colangelo said and if that were true , we would n't be sitting here talking there are whispers that colangelo s interests are spread thin now , that the suns are not his priority anymore his 31yearold son , bryan , is the general manager colangelo has been sidetracked with bringing major league baseball to town colangelo will have none of it , however the suns are the mother lode , he said before loss no 12 the other night , when a desperation 3pointer by majerle won a game for miami against his former team the suns have made it all possible this is not a passing fancy with me i do n't think that s a problem we 'll be back photo nets' shawn bradley trying to block a shot by michael finley of the suns last night phoenix won , 9977 , after having lost all 13 of its previous games \( associated press \) \( pg b24 \)
despite being 27 years old and living at the shore , mark oliver insists he has never before been accused of engaging in tumultuous behavior especially not on a surfboard i'm not sure i even know what tumultuous means , he said peter o'mara , a lawyer from red bank , frowned at the wrinkled police report mr oliver gave him the charge was made in spring lake , after mr oliver and three friends surfing off a jetty pretended not to hear the lifeguards ordering them in basically , tumultuous behavior means fighting , mr o'mara explained in court , it s what they sometimes downgrade an assault charge to the smile washed off mr oliver s face like an ebb tide assault \? he said for not coming in when they whistled \? mr oliver and about 20 other members of the jersey chapter of the national surfrider foundation were gathered around a big table last saturday afternoon at a hotel in sea girt to discuss what they believe is a campaign of harassment of surfers in new jersey , whose beaches are the most heavily regulated in the nation since the start of the season , at least seven surfers have been arrested and charged in several towns for being in the water when the surf s up mr oliver and his companions were arrested on july 13 , as a fading tropical storm whipped the sea and beach patrols ordered people out of the surf when the lifeguards called us in , we were thinking like , we just took a halfhour to paddle out here , he said besides , the waves were n't even that big summoned by the beach patrol , the coast guard soon arrived in a motorized raft and chased the surfers to land , where the police waited for them while a crowd gathered to watch the showdown we were handcuffed and taken away like criminals , mr oliver muttered but larry schmidt , 26 , another of the accused tumultmakers , said with a touch of pride , about 80 people were on the boardwalk cheering us mr oliver added hey , we 're out there surfing all year round we 're out when the water is 30 degrees and the waves are twice as big but in the summer , all these towns are concerned about is control such laments must be seen in the context of the summer of 1995 , known among jersey surfers as the best in at least 30 years , thanks to offshore storms that churned the atlantic while conditions were excellent for experienced surfers , however , 12 swimmers drowned off north jersey beaches last summer , the most in memory the year before , there were none authorities in seashore towns insist that the potential for lawsuits , far more than publicity over loss of life , is why beaches resound with lifeguards' whistles this summer and the red no swimming flags go up whenever the surf gets a little rough at the meeting last week , one of the veterans , bob sickler , said he had just returned from a 20 , 000mile surfing safari to the world s top beaches in jersey , i live a quartermile from the beach and i ca n't go surfing when it s headhigh \? i mean , it s chesthigh and they 're pulling us out of the water we 're not exactly talking waimea bay here , he said , referring to the surfing mecca on oahu where the only warning lifeguards give is to be careful of tiger sharks , which can take a chunk the size of a manhole cover out of a surfboard many veteran surfers , like ed mahon , 46 , of long branch , remember the the 1960 s , when some beach towns regarded surfers as bums and erected signs at the border with messages like drug addicts and surfers must register with police the beach boys grew up , however some of them even graduated from law school today , new jersey s surfers are organized , articulate and , they say , ready to act as a wedge to open up more public discussion about beach access and other public uses of a seashore that is being restored by the federal government at huge taxpayer expense mr o'mara , one of several lawyers among the surfers who met in sea girt , plans to challenge the arrests on constitutional grounds others want to begin a publicrelations drive to equate surfers with athletes who participate at their own risk in other potentially perilous sports like skiing and rock climbing they also plan to meet with town councils to work out compromises between their rights and governmental responsibility to protect public safety we get depicted as these crazed thrillseekers just waiting for the next disastrous hurricane , said mr mahon are you nuts ! i have a family i have seashore property still , i am like a 12yearold when it comes to surfing every day , i get out of bed around dawn and check out the waves drawing

bloomfield hills , mich , june 11 it happens on the first tee of the first event the week after the united states open whether it s at an exhibition , an outing , a pga tour event or a club tournament does n't matter when a player has just won the united states open , that first public proclamation never fails to raise goose bumps ladies and gentlemen , on the tee , the us open champion fill in the name , the sensation is always the same the first time you hear it , tom kite said , it s very special you think to yourself , 'yeah , that s what i am' no matter what else happens , that s what he is and for all of the 156 players in the united states open this week at oakland hills , that is what they want to be to those who have won it , the open can be the attainment of a lifelong goal , the ticket to fortune and fame , the validation of a career it can even be an albatross , as andy north discovered , or it can be vindication , as kite learned when he finally won it in 1992 to those who have not won it , it can be the lone gap in an otherwise brilliant career , a haunting reminder , as it is to sam snead and was to jimmy demaret , an unconquered and taunting foe as it is to seve ballesteros , a beckoning siren as it is to nick faldo different things to different people but one thing is always the same about the effect of the title united states open champion i know this , when you go to your grave , they say , 'open champion soandso was buried today , ' said dave marr , the nbc commentator and 1965 pga championship winner who finished fourth in the 1966 open it s history , and it s enormous , and you may not even realize the enormity of it until you have it i know how much it meant to the guys who never got it , to sam snead and to jimmy demaret it s huge it is so huge that it has defined players tom watson , after he holed that shot from off the green at the 17th at pebble beach in 1982 to beat jack nicklaus , would never again be remembered for his collapse in the open at winged foot in 1974 he had already won six majors , two masters and four british opens the very same number of majors that faldo now has but , before the victory , questions persisted about watson s inability to win the open there was a hole in the record , watson said and when it closed , watson took that leap in public perception , from very good player to great player the same thing happened to curtis strange in 1988 and 1989 , when he won backtoback opens the memory of his 1985 masters debacle was expunged , and he was now the toughest guy in golf , a guy who could make a reference to ben hogan s backtoback victories and say , move over , ben those sort of things that come with an open victory are part of what makes it so difficult to win , said bob rotella , the sports psychologist players think about the benefits , the money , the exemption , the way they 'll be perceived win the open and all of a sudden you 're validated this is n't to say that faldo is somehow less than authentic hardly but there is a hole in the record for all his reputation as a great ball striker and pressure player , he has yet to win a major on a course that has significant rough he has three masters titles and three british open titles , two at muirfield and one at st andrews though muirfield had some rough , it was n't united states open style rough , and st andrews had none how important is winning the united states open \? well , it s obviously one that i do n't have , he said last week at the buick classic at westchester all the majors are important i do n't put one above the other but it s one that i 'd like very much to win , yes , of course it also is one that greg norman wants and needs the bottom line says that norman has two majors , both british opens , but he probably has come closer to winning the career grand slam than anyone who does not have it with the possible exception of arnold palmer he is the only player in golf history to have the reverse slam he has lost playoffs in all four majors norman s closest call in the open came in 1983 at winged foot , when he lost a playoff to fuzzy zoeller but he has been in the open hunt three times in the 90 s , as recently as last year at shinnecock , and after what happened at augusta this year , an open victory would provide major catharsis i 'd like to win one here in the united states , norman said i have come close i will give myself another chance to win this one some day davis love and colin montgomerie could use an open victory for the same reason both are often tagged as the best players who have not won a major for mark o'meara , an open would provide instant elevation to the next level he has been the most consistent player on the pga tour this year , winning twice , and finishing second , first , second , third in his last four events but he also has missed the cut in six straight opens when asked for an explanation for his lack of success in the open , o'meara said i really do n't have any but , just like any player , i 'd love to win it it s our national championship you can quibble about course setup and all the amateurs in the field and all the qualifiers who have no chance to win you can talk about how the deck is stacked , how the short game is eliminated , how the fun is sucked out like air from a cabin depressurizing at 30 , 000 feet at the end of the day , the united states open is still the national championship and when phil mickelson was a kid growing up , chipping balls and putting in his backyard , he was no different than millions of other kids for other generations marr explains it as well as anyone it s the one tournament , he said , when you 're a kid and you 're learning , you 're playing two or three balls , and this one s hogan s and that one is snead s i'm on that green and i'm trying to make this to win the national open i was n't trying to win the houston open or the pga or the north and south or the western i was trying to win the national open he never did more wo n't than will but those who do , they know the feeling of standing on the tee , forever tied to a tournament that is the hardest to win , and hearing their name linked to it photo tom watson after chipping in at no 17 at pebble beach in 1982 \( associated press \) chart jewel in the crown for some golfers , a us open victory has put a defining stamp on their careers , even ones filled with other triumphs for other golfers , an open would validate their careers players who have it jack nicklaus baltusrol 1980 given up for dead , he makes his fourth and final open win the sweetest ben hogan merion 1950 just 16 months after a nearfatal bus accident , he wins his second of four opens tom watson pebble beach 1982 holing out on the 71st hole to beat nicklaus was as memorable as his five british opens arnold palmer cherry hills 1960 he drove the first green and charged on to win his lone national open bobby jones interlachen cc , 1930 his fourth and last open came in the grand slam year curtis strange oak hill , 1989 his second straight open victory validated him as a tough player in tough situations tom kite pebble beach , 1992 consummate workaholic completes his major quest on brutally windy day corey pavin shinnecock hills , 1995 the 4wood at the last is burned indeliby into open history players who have not nick faldo has three masters and three british opens but must add the us to be mentioned with snead , palmer , et al colin montgomerie playoff losses in '94 us open and '95 pga have made him best player not to have won a major mark o'meara has missed six straight open cuts since his best , a tie for third at brookline in 1988 davis love 3d his tie for fourth at shinnecock showed he s finally open ready phil mickelson has major , major game and , at age 25 , plenty of time but he s right on track for an open greg norman has come closer to the career grand slam than anyone who does n't have it
sarajevo , bosnia and herzegovina , dec 23 bosnian serb leaders said today that they refused to take part in the new national government of bosnia , a position that reflects the abiding influence of the former bosnian serb leader , radovan karadzic dr karadzic , who has been indicted by the war crimes tribunal in the hague , was supposed to have been removed from all political control months ago the decision not to join the bosnian government frustrated even the optimists among foreign diplomats , who nevertheless said the apparent setback might be only temporary nothing is ever final in this country , one western diplomat said but others said it proved that efforts to persuade bosnian serb leaders to comply with their commitments to a national bosnian government will fail as long as dr karadzic and a small group of extreme nationalists remain in power one diplomat , requesting anonymity , said of dr karadzic s followers they see a joint government as the end of their dream of an independent serbian state and with it , the end of their power to get rich and be safe from war crimes indictments the trouble for us is they are right so how do we make them give that up \? michael steiner , a german diplomat overseeing civilian efforts to form the new bosnian government , said negotiations foundered on the bosnian serb insistence that the new government meet half the time on serbiancontrolled territory , instead of a third of the time in the absence of a national government , bosnia remains divided , with a serbian state controlling about half the territory and a muslimcroat federation the other half though the national government is to have few powers , it is considered an essential link between the two regional administrations and for purposes of relations with the outside world , it is to be the official face of bosnia more than that , with serbian , muslim and croatian officials working together , it was intended to be a way of slowly reunifying the country even with the reluctance of bosnian serb politicians to join the government , there have been advances in the muslimcroat federation doubts remain , however , about how sincere the reconciliation between the muslim and croatian politicians may be edhem bicakcic , the prime minister of the muslimcroat federation and a top official of the muslim political party , said in an interview that he was convinced that the federation will work and that croat leaders have decided to join with us to make the state we all agreed to however , croatian authorities continue to allow expulsion of some muslims from areas under croatian control it may be , some diplomats said , that the best the federation can do is put on the appearance of a joint government and hope the nationalist leaders will learn to work together over time that was to begin today , as 15 ministers started to create a croatmuslim administration at the same time , croatian citizens of sarajevo were lining up for donated groceries at the party headquarters of the croatian nationalists they complained that muslim officials refuse to give them rations ivan sakota , a retired croatian bus driver , said , as soon as i show them my identity card , they tell me to go somewhere else and ask fears of showdown in belgrade belgrade , serbia , dec 23 \( ap \) hundreds of riot policemen were bused into belgrade today and aides to president slobodan milosevic called for a huge rally at the same square where opposition groups have protested for the past month the moves raised fears that mr milosevic s supporters could clash with his opponents , tens of thousands of whom have been demonstrating daily against the annulment of local elections the staterun tanyug news agency announced the promilosevic rally in downtown belgrade , saying all those who are for peace , freedom , independent serbia and against terrorism and foreign rule should gather in the square on tuesday afternoon mr milosevic s opponents have been protesting at the same square at the same time there have been confrontations in the past week , but none have yet erupted into violence milosevic is trying to provoke bloodshed on belgrade streets , an opposition party spokesman , slobodan vuksanovic , said today the opposition also said mr milosevic was trying to provoke clashes by disguising policemen as his supporters
ben bianchi pollockkrasner house and study center , 830 fireplace road , east hampton to july 28 by appointment , 3244929 in a departure from presentations of art related to the pollock years , this historic site features 1995 collages by ben bianchi , a friend and onetime neighbor of lee krasner over the years , visitors have noted an intriguing , surreal assemblage by mr bianchi that ms krasner had placed rather centrally in her parlor mr bianchi tried to infuse the collages with visual and mental energy by layering torn fragments of his watercolors , drawings and prints with a miscellany of commercial and periodical papers original gestural markings in his recycled art now appear abruptly truncated by their new , accidentally determined boundaries , and this contributes to the busy dynamics there is a reminder here of ms krasner s tearing and reusing of her earlier work , but mr bianchi chooses a broader palette , bringing in lettering from printed matter and images conjuring sight and sound impressions , particularly of new york s chinatown , the location of his last studio a scrap of medical chart in one collage serves as a reminder that this is , in a sense , a memorial exhibition mr bianchi died in march at age 62 after a long illness he had worked on the collages while recuperating from surgery a concurrent presentation calls attention to a single painting , a collaborative work by jackson pollock , william baziotes and gerome kamrowski , that resonates with historical significance it brings visitors back to an evening in 1941 when mr baziotes brought pollock to mr kamrowski s studio and the three decided to experiment with some quickdrying paint developed for commercial purposes a principal interest was finding a freer way of applying paint to go further with the psychic automatism that they had been recently discussing with the surrealist painter matta they tried dripping , pouring and flinging the loosely flowing material the result is a dark surface bearing bold biomorphic shapes activated by overlapping lines of varying widths lines alternately strike a course , then swirl and loop unpredictibly , inviting the eye through a maze of visual discovery where these energetic strands loop into the canvas s black areas , they eliminate the separation between image and background and suggest the shifting ambiguities that were so important to subsequent phases of abstraction this is the one surviving work from that evening it is on loan from mr kamrowski s daughter coenties slip artists now and then elise goodheart fine arts , 61 island view drive , sag harbor to july 14 7255764 more than 30 years ago , charles hinman physically altered the picture plane with concave convex canvases , and agnes martin turned rhythmic gestures into a mesmerizing repetitive order both were among a group renting studios on coenties slip , at that time an inexpensive and forgotten part of old new york s commercial waterfront their work , along with that of their neighbors joe cali , robert indiana , ellsworth kelly , fred mitchell , lenore tawney and jack youngerman , is the subject of this modest but historically sound overview comparisions between that period and recent work suggest that most have continued to grow within the formal areas they defined while at coenties slip , although this is not the comprehensive show that would be necessary to examine the question fully perhaps the greatest shift appears in the remarkable pieces by ms tawney her 1967 shield is a partfirm , partpliable form of feathers and fiber that emphasizes the expressive handling of materials the 1996 assemblage shrine xv uses a puffy , toylike animal anchored in a grid of blue wires to deliver a conceptual message about a hightechnology world there are obvious shifts , too , in some fine pieces by mr kelly , who has continued to research minimalist dynamics , and by mr mitchell , who now softens edges and tones , infusing them with light to add a shimmering quality to a rich , densely painted surface mr indiana s sixfoot sculpture love now seems like an icon of its day this and the artist s several other examples make strong additions to the presentation conrad marcarelli vered gallery , 68 park place passage , east hampton to july 11 3243303 in this wonderful selection of primarily black and white collages , 1956 1996 , mr marcarelli looks his best as good , perhaps , as he did in his whitney museum show in 1967 it may be significant that just 6 of the 15 pieces here are dated after that show , and it is undoubtedly significant that the gallery has hung none of the late60 s collages with strap motifs , which , in retrospect , seem to have slowed the surface interactions it should be noted , however , that two works from the 70 s make substantial contributions to the show windmill , a smashing 11foot burst of diagonal energy , functions in the area between worldly image and abstract emblem figures provides a sense of texture , unravelling material and handcrafting its adaptation of grommets as a visual motif also encourages a play between a factual reading and pure abstraction a complex inventory of ideas runs throughout the exhibition most impressive is the use of perceptual forces as a subject in the best example , october , dots of differing sizes behave like stains , blurring and spreading as if they were seeking their own boundaries while all relate , each is held within its own unit it is the variety of approaches to creating units , or fragments , that also makes an impact these segments establish order , but at the same time the torn edges introduce a sense of the accidentally determined shape other works stand out for the way they consider questions of weight , movement and the layering of seemingly flat forms in different planes most of the work has held its force , urgency and power well over the years the bolder examples that are close to the interests of younger artists may even have gained in stature photos top and right , conrad marcarelli and ben bianchi collagesbelow , indiana s yield brother samuel , and pollockkamrowskibaziotes

for all its extravagance , or rather because of it , rudolf nureyev s 1992 version of la bayadere for the paris opera ballet is not to be missed in a white elephant of a 19thcentury work and in a production predicated on glamour and glitz , the french company manages to make the incredible plausible it was a calculated risk for the paris opera ballet to open its first season in new york since 1988 with this work american ballet theater had , in fact , just performed natalia makarova s more coherent and complete staging of the 1877 classic at the same metropolitan opera house but nureyev s bayadere is a bayadere with a difference , and this was not just another opening , another show in the deepest sense , the production is nureyev s last creative act above all , he made this classic by marius petipa a showcase for the fabulous dancers he directed at the paris opera from 1983 to 1989 and when the french company opened on monday night for a season through july 3 , it was led by a superb cast of principals isabelle guerin , laurent hilaire and elisabeth platel , with patrick dupond , still french ballet s super star , putting in a brazen cameo as the golden idol more than anything , this triumphant return testified to the grand scale on which petipa s ballet was reconceived one can smile at nureyev s taste \( hollywood \) and the stylistic inconsistencies of his several choreographic emendations but there is no denying the dazzling visual impact of the entire production the india of ezio frigerio s decor is worthy of any 1920 s movie palace the goldthreaded colors in franca squarciapino s costumes radiate a luxuriant texture in this eyeriveting context , the ballet s dated orientalisms and melodramatic plot are lifted into a suspended level of reality the most startling visual moment occurs at the very heart of the ballet , its raison d'etre this is the kingdom of the shades act in which solor , the hero , seeks out the ghost of his beloved nikiya , whom he has abandoned for gamzatti , a rajah s daughter the kirov ballet , which first introduced this act to the west with nureyev as solor in 1961 , and other productions set the scene in the moonlit forest mr frigerio threads the famous line of shades , or ghosts , through the gray light of a lush green jungle the ballet takes place in india , after all nureyev rethought his production in movie mogul terms there would be no bayadere without the kingdom of the shades we do n't really care whether solor betrays nikiya , the temple dancer but rare is the viewer who cannot appreciate petipa s pure classical dancing in the shades act for what it is a masterpiece of form and structure that leaves romantic ballet behind and points firmly toward the art of the 20th century what nureyev did was balance petipa s classical choreography with a brilliance of colors that would enliven the slowmoving mime of the preceding acts solor arrives unabashedly for his engagement party on an elephant on wheels , and there is no dearth of turbaned spear carriers ms makarova cut many of the character dances that nureyev retained from the kirov version although aided by ninel kurgapkina , a former kirov ballerina , nureyev was too ill to complete a fouract version he ended the work not with the gods wreaking vengeance on all , but with the shades act three months after his death in january 1993 , the production was performed at the john f kennedy center for the performing arts in washington now as then , it has none of the operatic grandeur of the makarova version but both stagings have been heavily influenced by changes made by soviet choreographers , chiefly vakhtang chabukiani and vladimir ponomaryov it is up to the dancers , then , to make the whole thing hang together and this they did with marvelous conviction and the projection of technique that radiates the paris school s refinement ms guerin s nikiya is as sensual as in 1993 , and her classical dancing has an astonishing amplitude , exemplified in the breadth of her leaps as gamzatti , ms platel has lost something in stamina but none of her elegance mr hilaire goes from strength to strength , and he delivered the essential doubleassemble turns in act iii as for mr dupond , capering around in act ii , he was very much his passionate self no more was required the joy of this company \( which is to present le parc by the experimental choreographer angelin preljocaj on friday , monday and tuesday \) is the brio and clarity of its style the corps will always point a foot and allow you to see it before each dancer sets it down in the same way , miteki kudo goes beyond charm as the dancer with a jar that threatens to fall off her head there is also the marvelous spring of the three soloists , agnes letestu , karin averty and nathalie rique aleksandr polyanichko , the conductor , thankfully speeded up the extraslow tempos of 1993 photo laurent hilaire , on the elephant , in the paris opera

the stadium that a consultant has recommended building for the yankees on the west side of manhattan would likely be the most expensive in the nation s history , but mayor rudolph w giuliani said yesterday that it could be built at little or no cost to the city s taxpayers experts in sports financing and some city officials , however , expressed skepticism yesterday that any new stadium could be built in new york city without taxpayer money , noting that most of the stadiums built in recent years have required some public financing although the details of financing a new stadium remain sketchy , the mayor and his aides say the city and state could issue bonds for it and pay them off by tapping revenues from ticket sales , luxury boxes , advertising and even the exclusive rights to sell beer in doing so , however , the city and state could come into direct conflict with the yankees' owner , george m steinbrenner 3d , who clearly hopes to use those same revenues to increase his own income from the team in fact , it is mr steinbrenner s dissatisfaction with the moneymaking potential of yankee stadium that is driving his effort to seek a new home at a news conference yesterday in city hall , where the future of the yankees was once again a dominant topic , mr giuliani said the promise of a vast new market of fans now unwilling to make the trip to the south bronx made the proposal for a multiuse stadium on the west side of manhattan the most enticing alternative to yankee stadium that was so , he said , even though it was the most expensive of four proposals the consultant considered , coming with a price tag of more than 1 billion purely from a financial analysis point of view , the mayor said , the place where the city could build a new stadium at virtually no cost to the taxpayer or very little cost to the taxpayer would be in manhattan because the value of property in manhattan is so great , you can finance it at very little cost there might even be ways to finance it at no cost or a profit such a method of financing has been used by other cities in recent years in the desperate race to keep or lure sports franchises , but sports experts said that in many of those cases public money either from taxes or lotteries helped build the stadiums and they pointed out that the cost of those stadiums was about a quarter to a third of the price that the consultants estimated for a new yankee stadium a stadium normally cannot be supported by direct revenues from the stadium itself , said anita b morrison , vice president of hammer , siler , george associates , a consulting firm in silver spring , md , that worked on plans for a new tiger stadium in detroit the study of possible sites for a new yankee stadium conducted by hellmuth , obata kassabaum of kansas city , mo , and financed jointly by the city , the state and mr steinbrenner did not directly address the question of paying for them but officials in new york and albany have proceeded on the assumption that the city and state would issue bonds probably through a public authority to cover the staggering costs the bonds would be paid off with money from a dedicated stream of revenues the question of where exactly those revenues would come from will be the most intense subject of negotiations between mr steinbrenner , the city and the state like most baseball owners , mr steinbrenner would like to keep as large a share as possible of those revenues for himself the selection of the site is by far the easiest part of the conversation with the yankees , said john s dyson , the deputy mayor for finance and economic development for that reason , the mayor s office and the yankees declined yesterday to discuss exactly how revenues from a new stadium might be divided david w sussman , the general counsel for the yankees , said it was premature to discuss possible financing schemes since none had been presented to the team in the consultant s study and in the remarks by the mayor and other officials , however , it was clear that a new stadium could produce lucrative sources of revenues from features that have become standard in new stadiums , like luxury boxes , licenses for special seats and even the rights to the name of the stadium in san francisco , for example , pacific bell recently promised to pay 50 million to put its name on a new stadium for the giants asked yesterday if he would allow a company to pay for the right to change the hallowed name of yankee stadium , the mayor replied with a laugh it depends on the amount of money , he said mr dyson said other possible sources of revenue could come from a surcharge on tickets or even a dedicated tax but he added increasing taxes is not the first , second , third or fourth resort taxes might be the last resort by emphasizing the potential sources of revenue , the mayor and his aides seemed to be trying to head off criticism that the city and state can ill afford a huge expense for a stadium at a time when mr giuliani s budget director recently ordered a 25 percent cut in capital spending some elected officials including ruth w messinger , the manhattan borough president , and fernando ferrer , her counterpart in the bronx have already rained doubt on the mayor s claims they say that improvements around a new stadium were unlikely to be covered by revenues from tickets and concessions alone and would almost certainly fall on taxpayers the study by hellmuth , obata estimated the cost of renovating yankee stadium at 770 million and rebuilding a new stadium next to the current site at 944 million the cost of a new west side stadium next to the hudson river between 30th and 33d streets would cost 847 million if used for baseball alone , while one suited for baseball and football would cost 106 billion the firm rejected stadiums at two other sites in the bronx , in van cortlandt park and pelham bay park , that would have cost even more by contrast , other new stadiums have been built for far less , including jacobs field in cleveland for 215 million and coors field in denver for 214 million the most expensive stadium thus far skydome in toronto , which has a retractable roof and other amenities envisioned for a new yankee stadium cost about 500 million marc s ganis , the president of sportscorp limited , a stadium development consultant in chicago , said that when he heard of the proposed costs for a new home for the yankees he thought somebody added a zero by mistake the notion of spending a billion dollars for a baseball stadium is even by today s standards outrageous , said mr ganis , whose company was involved in the relocation of the rams from los angeles to the new twa dome in st louis last year but the mayor said , when you look at these numbers , the amounts do n't mean as much as the ability to finance it and therefore not have to cost the taxpapers any money , or a minimum amount of money
uniondale , li , jan 9 thankful for small favors , the islanders salvaged a 33 tie against the chicago blackhawks tonight after gaining an offtheice victory during the day all in all , it was an ok day for a team that had such a miserable early season but the islanders have now churned out a 314 record in the last eight games it might have been better if the only islander named to the allstar team today defenseman mathieu schneider had n't been nailed for interference off a faceoff with just over five minutes left in regulation fiftynine seconds later , bernie nicholls pumped in his second goal of the period to produce the tie of course , they still have n't beaten the blackhawks on long island in more than 11 years tonight s tie was only their fifth , to go with eight losses over the span then again , the hawks are a more solid team forty solid minutes , schneider moaned and then we shoot ourselves on the foot but we 'll take the point still , he wondered what might have happened if the team did n't play it safe for the young team , there s room for secondguessing after a game like tonight s after falling behind by 20 , the hawks , who arrived at their hotel at 2 in the afternoon , pounced on the isles for three goals in the third period to push the game into overtime nicholls s second goal offset niclas andersson s score that tied the game coach mike milbury has apparently solved the vexing problem of what to do with kirk muller , the reluctant and suspended islander center whose status helped bring down one administration milbury , who has added general manager to his role with the islanders , said before the game he had finally gotten muller to go wherever the team wants to send him once he signed his contract , milbury said , he really could n't go wherever he wanted to go muller had been trying to do just that but milbury had trouble dealing a player who other clubs were not convinced would show up , a problem compounded because muller was said to be demanding more than his islander contract , which is worth about 15 million a year and has two seasons left after this one muller , whose nhl career began as the devils' top draft choice in 1984 , had never wanted to become an islander after being traded last april from the montreal canadiens , where he was captain he joined new york in the fiveplayer deal in which general manager don maloney of the islanders traded pierre turgeon muller balked at reporting to long island when he arrived , he played in 15 games , with a grand total of 7 points \( including 4 goals \) more telling , though , was that he performed at minus10 maloney , explaining the player was n't focused , sent muller home in november a month later , maloney was dismissed and milbury was handed the dual role of coachgeneral manager he immediately suspended muller , then sought a trade none could be made rival general managers told milbury they were reluctant to make a deal because they did n't know what it would cost them but on monday , muller and his agent , mike barnett , finally told milbury they were acceding to a trade kirk told me , 'i 've got to get playing do what you have to do , ' milbury said that notion seemed to be working for the islanders on the ice as well before facing the blackhawks tonight , they found themselves on a sort of hot streak 313 in their last seven games they carried over their revival into tonight with a commanding forechecking performance , they outshot the hawks by 175 in the opening period , and took a 10 lead , which they padded to 20 after two sessions many of their early shots were up close , in front of ed belfour in goal , but they did not have the extra snap to get the puck beyond him finally , with 34 seconds left in the opening period , zigmund palffy slashed home a rebound of a shot by travis green slap shots the weather shut the blackhawks out of new york until this morning , when they flew in from chicago and arrived at their hotel , not far from the nassau coliseum , at about 2 pm , only five and a half hours before game time they found the arena parking lot plowed and clean , but the surrounding roads were tricky the islanders are allowing ticket holders who missed tonight s game to attend the feb 23 contest against tampa bay mick vukota , the right wing who has been out with a broken right thumb , will undergo surgery that will keep him sidelined another six weeks

washington , may 29 the guilty verdicts returned on tuesday in the whitewater case in arkansas hit political washington like a bomb , surprising almost everyone but after a night s reflection and a day s gossip , most of the political professionals concluded that it had been a small bomb we thought al d'amato had killed whitewater as an issue , a white house official conceded this afternoon the little rock jury has brought it back to life , but we still doubt it will dominate the presidential campaign senator bob dole declined to make a substantive comment on the verdict i have n't commented on whitewater since day 1 , so i wo n't comment on today s whatever , he said and one of his advisers , senator john mccain of arizona , predicted that mr dole would avoid the issue , for the most part , in the months ahead it would be a big mistake , mr mccain said by telephone from phoenix , for bob dole to take the president on this first , the american people are perfectly capable of making a judgment on their own without a lot of namecalling , and second , it s not dole s nature we need issues , and if this is the best the republican party can do , then we do n't have any real issues but whatever senator dole himself does , other republicans , including senator alfonse m d'amato of new york , a staunch dole ally who has been holding a meandering series of hearings on whitewater , are sure to do what they can to keep the pot bubbling typical comments came from tony blankley , speaker newt gingrich s spokesman , who said what he called the coverup had started to unravel , and from william kristol , a top republican strategist , who said the 12 arkansas jurors would have an effect none of the capitol hill hearings had achieved to date much will depend on what lies ahead not only what new information is disclosed , but when ralph reed , the executive director of the christian coalition , said today that the verdicts made whitewater a wild card in the november balloting but mr reed warned that the truly damaging revelations in past scandals , from teapot dome to watergate to irancontra , came so late that they had little effect on the fortunes of the presidents and parties involved from president clinton s point of view , there is ample reason to worry , not because he was implicated in this first trial , in which he testified for the defense on videotape indeed , all but one of the jurors who spoke with reporters after the verdicts were delivered said they had believed the president s testimony a fact that the white house damagecontrol team sought to drive home by compiling their comments in an allnight session and then releasing them but there is much more to come the president is expected to be subpoenaed again to testify in a second trial beginning next month , grand juries will be studying statements made by hillary rodham clinton and white house aides about the loss and reappearance of some of her law firm s billing records , and republicancontrolled investigations on capitol hill will drag on it is possible , though highly unlikely , according to those involved in the case , that those convicted on tuesday gov jim guy tucker and the president s onetime business partners , james b mcdougal and susan mcdougal might agree to cooperate with federal prosecutors in return for shorter prison sentences in any event , tuesday s events have greatly strengthened the hand of kenneth w starr , the chief prosecutor , who is a republican had the defendants been found guilty on only a few counts or found not guilty , as the white house had reportedly expected , that would have lent weight to charges that mr starr was conducting a politically motivated witch hunt without much substance he had also been accused of conflicts of interest because he has continued to represent private clients who have legal dealings with the government now , however , his work will get intensive media attention especially the trial , set to open on june 17 , of herby branscum jr and robert m hill , a pair of arkansas bankers mr clinton is more directly involved in this case , because at its center is an allegation that they raised money for his 1990 gubernatorial reelection campaign in return for a promise that mr branscum would get a state job he was later named to the state highway commission i do n't think it s helpful , said anne wexler , a washington lobbyist with close ties to the clinton administration you get words like 'clinton , ' 'guilty' and 'whitewater' in close juxtaposition , and you have a kind of openended problem but i think i'm like most people who try in vain to follow the story , and find that there are no real links between the clintons and all this a prominent senate democrat , who spoke on condition of anonymity , said he thought the main impact of tuesday s events would be indirect the republicans , he said , would use this general aura of sleaze to try to suggest that the president , who has changed or modified his positions on a number of issues recently , ca n't be trusted to do what he says he will ted van dyk , a democratic strategist who has criticized mr clinton on numerous occasions in the last five years , predicted without qualification that whitewater would take a dominant place in the campaign if the american people have not been watching these matters closely , mr van dyk said in the current issue of his newsletter , they will begin to do so now the gop convention this august in san diego will surely become a whitewater feast , with primetime speeches and films over several days few leaders in either party are making similar predictions but by the same token , few profess to say when the hubbub will die down
his suit was rumpled , his hands were trembling and his sentences broken by bursts of nervous laughter it was four months since dick morris left the democratic national convention in chicago in disgrace , and yesterday president clinton s former political consultant turned up in front of a classroom of new york university political science students , offering a defense for a profession whose fortunes seemed to have fallen with his own for nearly an hour , mr morris , accompanied by a public relations consultant and an invited television crew from the abc news magazine prime time live , used his first prolonged public appearance since he left mr clinton s side to hold forth on the good things that , he argued , political consulting and polling had brought to democracy he offered some stories from the white house on how he had helped mr clinton win reelection , and he shared with a classroom of aspiring dick morrises suggestions on how they might break into his world mr morris talked not about himself , but about his profession , as if he considered the two one and the same , and as if a defense of consultants who have come under particular criticism because of mr morris would serve as a defense for his own actions he was not asked yesterday about a tabloid report of his association with a prostitute , which is what led him to resign as mr clinton s consultant in august the students seemed alternately fascinated and disconcerted by mr morris s appearance there have been misperceptions about his profession , mr morris said , standing in front of a blackboard and grasping a sliver of chalk i think that what we as an industry are doing , he said , and i as an individual have tried to do , is to try to find a way to help an american official , or candidate , lead people in a democracy when tyler perrin regan , 26 , a political science student from greenwich , conn , asked for advice on how to get into politics , mr morris offered a horatio algerstyle answer that reflected his own career find a candidate who will win work without pay anticipate demands , and make yourself indispensable that said , mr morris offered a gritty description of the profession he came to defend it basically requires the ability of an academic and the canniness of a drug pusher , mr morris said his audience reacted with gasps and laughter and , stammering , he seemed taken aback for a moment it was an odd and , at times , awkward morning for mr morris the lecture hall for the class , power and politics in america , was barely twothirds filled the undergraduates reacted cheerfully to morning greetings from their teacher hi , kids ! prof anna l harvey said , after she returned a stack of examinations but were more reserved with mr morris they were hushed for most of the session , occasionally joining mr morris in laughter at his jokes or , in the case of at least one student , catching up on sleep politics is a huge occupation , mr morris said , trying to warm up his audience can anybody guess the number of elected people in the united states \? there was silence , so mr morris , tried again nobody knows let s hear some guesses more silence \( there are 800 , 000 people running for office , mr morris said \) while none of the eight questions to mr morris dealt with his fall from grace , it was obviously on everybody s mind when mr morris told how he advised mr clinton to urge the nation to embrace ethics classes to teach virtues to students , ms regan scribbled a note to a friend did he ever attend one of those , do you think \? mr morris has made occasional appearances since he left the white house , including as a commentator on wcbstv , channel 2 , on election night but he has always been best known in washington for his offtherecord dealings with reporters in this case , the reporters present were by invitation only \( no tabloids \) still , there was a slight quiver in mr morris s voice , and he seemed nervous during his turn at the blackboard given the constraints of speaking in public , he was taciturn he presented himself , and mr clinton , in the most charitable light , particularly as he explained mr clinton s famous political flexibility appearances to the contrary , mr morris said , he and mr clinton were always clear on their final goal the wind is blowing this way , so he goes toward the exit sign , but he goes like this way , mr morris said , using his hands to mimic the fluttering of a sail and then it s blowing this way , so he shifts his sails and he goes that way he s still working his way toward the exit sign , but he s not being an idiot about it and then he goes a little this way and a little that way , and he ends up where he wants to go even in this controlled environment , mr morris s remarks yesterday were as extensive as any he has given since a tabloid reported his encounters with a prostitute at a washington hotel mr morris suggested that had he been in the white house in the first years , mr clinton might have survived the two most damaging initiatives of his first term trying to drop the ban on homosexuals in the military and passing universal health care
one morning 12 years ago , a celebrated stage and film director , an awardwinning playwright , a hot young director from chicago and a wealthy patron of the arts gathered for breakfast at the carlyle hotel in new york to ponder a question that had bedeviled the theater world for years could that perennial basket case of the american stage , the vivian beaumont theater , be saved \? it was not an issue of landmark preservation but of artistic rescue the beaumont , which opened in 1965 as a component of the sprawling lincoln center complex , was widely regarded as a failure by that morning in the fall of 1984 , it had been dark for four years , its financial reserves depleted a bitter dispute had erupted among its critics and beaumont officials over management of the theater , which not only had ceased to be discussed as america s answer to the national theater in london but had such a vast , unconventional space a combination thrust and proscenium stage that many directors and designers deemed it unplayable over juice and coffee , the carlyle four mike nichols , david mamet , gregory mosher and linda janklow , at the time a member of the beaumont board , and now its chairwoman hashed out scenarios for reviving the beaumont i basically said , 'have i lost my mind , or is there any hope for this theater \? ' ms janklow recalled recently the meeting , in a sense , was the beginning of another era for the beaumont , an era that has seen the cavernous theater and its smaller lincoln center sister , the mitzi e newhouse , move from the theatrical backwater into the forefront of american theater it set in motion events that would bring a new team of administrators , artists and benefactors to the renamed lincoln center theater , and make it what it is today the preeminent institutional theater in the country , a theater with a slew of critical hits to its credit , a 25 million annual budget and a membership of 41 , 000 playgoers so devoted that there is a waiting list of 12 , 000 names the rebirth of theater at lincoln center enters its latest phase on nov 6 , when the beaumont , long criticized for its acoustical dead spots and neckcrimping sightlines , reopens after a 10month , 62 million renovation with juan darien a carnival mass the production , a musictheater piece using masks and puppetry , is a reworked version of a show by the director julie taymor and the composer elliot goldenthal that was first presented in new york in 1988 the restoration project , the most ambitious overhaul of the 1 , 050seat theater in its 30year history , included replacing the beaumont s ventilation systems , lighting grid and air conditioning , remodeling bathrooms and ramps for the handicapped and improving the acoustics with a new 500 , 000 sound system the mitzi newhouse is currently undergoing its own less costly refurbishment and will reopen in february with craig lucas s god s heart architecturally , the two theaters will look much the same still , the project is more than a construction job it is further evidence of the resuscitation of an institution once given up for dead , further confirmation of the central role it now occupies in the cultural life of the city , a role it was always meant to have now , having stabilized its finances and cemented its reputation , lincoln center theater must come to grips with a larger question what kind of theater is it going to be \? this is an age when audiences look increasingly to the nonprofit theater for original work , when big institutions like the joseph papp public theater and the manhattan theater club seek to be players on broadway will lincoln center theater choose to become even more commercial , or will it use its money and power to become the leading creative force in the nation for new theater \? more than three decades ago , when the producer robert whitehead and the director elia kazan were first given the mandate to create a lincoln center repertory theater , the vision was of a theater with a permanent company of actors that would perform the classics and new american plays that was never truly to be lincoln center theater has indeed presented new works by writers like eric bogosian , tom donaghy , howard korder and jon robin baitz , and it has instituted a widely praised training program for young directors but it has not evolved into a repertory company or a purveyor of the classics in the mode of a traditional national theater oddly enough , the theater , a nonprofit giant , has made a name for itself replicating the producing pattern of broadway , as a hitmaker over the last decade , lincoln center theater has compiled a track record unparalleled in contemporary american theater other major nonprofit institutions in new york , like the roundabout theater company , the manhattan theater club and the joseph papp public theater , have had standout productions but none rival lincoln center for consistent success each one of its biggest hits has been a defining theatrical event of its season among them the house of blue leaves \( 1986 \) anything goes and sarafina ! \( 1987 \) speedtheplow \( 1988 \) six degrees of separation \( 1990 \) the sisters rosensweig \( 1992 \) carousel \( 1994 \) and the heiress \( 1995 \)

founding father rediscovering george washington by richard brookhiser 230 pp new york the free press 25 he is with us every day , on our dollar bills and quarters he looks down on us from mount rushmore in the national capital that bears his name he has the most prominent memorial , the largest tribute to patriarchy ever built more schools , streets and cities bear his name than that of any other american , and historians consistently rank him , along with abraham lincoln and franklin d roosevelt , as one of our three greatest presidents after he died in 1799 , a congressional resolution provided his epitaph first in war , first in peace and first in the hearts of his countrymen but richard brookhiser believes that the omnipresence of george washington does not translate into familiarity he is in our textbooks and our wallets , mr brookhiser observes in founding father , but not our hearts that is partly washington s fault , since he possessed distancing mechanisms second to none his eloquent silences made him america s version of the delphic oracle also , he became a living legend so early in his career that the historical record is clotted with patriotic rhetoric of the most platitudinous kind , blocking access to the human features behind his masks yet mr brookhiser effectively argues that we ourselves are implicated in making washington an anonymous american hero our talkshow culture demands at least a taint of scandal thomas jefferson s putative liaison with sally hemings makes him seem more interesting , more like us washington is boringly pure , apparently beyond temptation we also prefer our heroes to be martyrs , like lincoln or john f kennedy , whose premature departures allow us to conjure up intriguing mighthavebeens we even admire soldiers who are honorable losers , like robert e lee washington , however , won his war and completed all his public assignments , then retired to mount vernon to die naturally of pneumonia , or perhaps of the bleeding and blistering inflicted on his fading body by the misguided physicians of the day finally , our scholarly gatekeepers favor memorable phrasings and literary eloquence , like the natural rights section of jefferson s declaration of independence or lincoln s gettysburg address but washington never made the most famous statement attributed to him i cannot tell a lie and was a man of action rather than words there are no memorable quotations inscribed on the walls of the washington monument mr brookhiser has decided to retrieve as much of the elusive washington as possible , in the apparent belief that he still has much to teach us his goal , as he puts it , is moral biography , and his avowed model is plutarch s lives of the noble grecians and romans from the outset , then , founding father runs directly against the grain of modern biography , which , as janet malcolm has so candidly stated , is driven by the urge to expose and eviscerate we read biography , according to this view , for the same bloodthirsty reasons we go to stock car races and boxing matches mr brookhiser is also running against strong scholarly trends , which envision the american past as a contaminated swamp positively brimming with ideological diseases like racism , sexism and patriarchy and his subject is nothing less than the most prominent deadwhitemale in american history moreover , mr brookhiser is not a cardcarrying historian who has lived in the 18th century for a long time he is a journalist , a senior editor at national review , who is merely taking an excursion into the past for all these reasons , this smallish book \( another defiant gesture , a biography that can be read at one sitting \) has much to overcome one starts it with the foreboding sense that there is really no way he can bring it off but he does one puts down founding father with a heightened appreciation for washington s seminal achievements as a soldier and a statesman and a similar sense of admiration for the stylishly elegant way mr brookhiser arranges his own thoughts and words somehow , he gets the delphic oracle to speak , and does so without wrenching him out of his 18thcentury context indeed , it is that very context , a world where selfrestraint trumps selfexpression , where impersonality outshines authenticity , that washington so epitomized and that we are asked to measure against our own half the book is devoted to reviewing washington s career we follow him from his early military failures in the french and indian war , through his leadership of the continental army during the american revolution , his retirement and return to preside over the constitutional convention , then his two terms as america s first president this is a familiar story that earlier biographers and historians have told in considerably greater detail the emphasis here is on what we might call washington s essentialism , his eerie ability to know where history was headed how did washington do it \? well , the second half of founding father is a meditation on that question suffice it to say that mr brookhiser does not think psychologizing about mothers or fathers , real or imagined , will get us very far we get glimpses at seneca s morals and joseph addison s cato as influential books , and also at christianity and freemasonry as influential bodies of thought the freshest and most intriguing candidate for influence is a guidebook called the rules of civility and decent behavior in company and in conversation , based on teachings by 16thcentury jesuits , which washington copied out when he was 16 how he managed to internalize these values is , of course , the great mystery and mr brookhiser prefers to involve us in searching out our answers rather than declare his own
bob dole at a gathering yesterday in wheaton , ill you 're the ones who are out there raising the families you 're the ones creating the jobs , and the future s all about what s going to happen in the next to your children , your grandchildren , your business as i said , there are about eight million jobs now owned by women and they 're growing at a much faster rate than jobs owned by men and small business is growing at a much faster rate than big business , as far as employees are concerned now i think we 're sort of all in this together i do n't know everybody s politics in here some in the media always think we only invite republicans as far as i know , it s open to the public and i would just say this none of us are perfect i 've voted 13 , 000 times , and clinton found probably six votes he did n't agree with i guess he agreed with all the others so that s fine with me the bottom line is this and we keep forgetting it we keep forgetting where we 're from you know , people give their right arm , left arm , both arms , anything to come to america this is the greatest country on the face of the earth and we 're going to make it better
talented , tormented clifford odets \( 19061963 \) never lived up to his early promise plays like waiting for lefty and awake and sing brought their young author instant success and , briefly , the mantle of eugene o'neill as the great white hope of broadway thereafter followed a long , painful decline dotted by increasingly infrequent , poorly received plays , and , as his journal and biography have revealed , infused with burning ambition , esthetic longing , countless love affairs and quite a bit of highliving much of the last two decades were spent in hollywood , where odets wrote screenplays and even directed a movie or two while awaiting inspiration \( his directorial credits include the 1944 film none but the lonely heart , which earned an oscar for ethel barrymore \) at the time of his death , he was feverishly at work on the first episodes of have gun will travel starring richard boone for television , referring to himself as a playwright manque odets , who collected art , was also something of a painter manque when he had insomnia or writers' block , he turned to making small , charged , cartoonishly expressionistic paintings on paper , mostly in combinations of watercolor , ink and gouache he was especially productive during the late 1940 s and 1950 s , when he endured the added trauma of being named a communist by the house committee on unamerican activities and blacklisted in hollywood more than 50 of these works form an engrossing exhibition at the michael rosenfeld gallery they are fleshed out by quotes from odets s journal , as well as photographs , books , memorabilia and letters from figures like charlie chaplin , cary grant and theodore dreiser \( who had briefly hoped that odets would direct the film version of sister carrie \) one of the photographs , by alfredo valente , shows the handsome young playwright in 1935 in the first flush of success he slouches in a chair , glowering at the camera while holding a cigarette to his lips and wearing an overcoat and stylish checked scarf it s a forced , overdirected pose , a portrait of the playwright as a wellgroomed angry young man that , one hopes , was meant somewhat ironically a second photograph , taken 15 years later by aaron siskin , is less studied it shows a jacketless , clearly sadder and wiser odets sitting at his desk , surrounded by about a dozen of his works from his art collection , all by paul klee , their ethereal motifs hovering about him like protective spirits odets owned art by chagall , picasso , soutine , roualt and others , but his lasting love was klee at one point , he had more than 60 works by the swiss artist , the largest group in private hands in the united states he purchased most of them from the new york dealer j b neumann , with whom he maintained an intense correspondence that covered klee s greatness and prices , the klee dealings of neumann s former associate and archrival karl nierendorf , and the possibility that odets might sell klees to his friends in hollywood \( they declined \) the only prior show of odets s paintings on paper was held at neumann s madison avenue gallery in 1947 as an artist , odets comes closest to klee in war scene , a seemingly beatific field of diaphanous red punctuated with little marks of yellow and red that turn out to be exploding planes and bombs otherwise , he is decidedly unlike klee his strong suit is not line but color , which he combines with intensity and imagination and instead of elegance and reserve , there s an ungainliness , a kind of adolescent tumult or comedic anguish that , like the voice in odets s journal , is raw and unformed odets s subjects range from women \( with a lot of emphasis on breasts \) to biblical , theatrical and operatic themes to portraits and selfportraits and figures his style is less than consistent , even within individual images , and somewhat generic his images suffer in comparison to those of other gifted amateurs whose vocations lay elsewhere , like august strindberg and arnold schoenberg one senses in them an infatuation with art in all guises , as well as an inability to form a lasting sexual bond the figures curve and bulge , with a funhousemirror wooziness that can be reminiscent of those of william copley , with whom odets shares an obsession with naked ladies , or the chicago imagists frequently the eye will find the most pleasure not in the central drama of the figures , but in background textures and patterns the red dotted wallpaper that is the backdrop of uneasy slumber , for example especially good are a number of deliberately rendered or casually speckled landscapes , like april swamp , old cemetery , don juan s last bed and the poignant , shahnlike burning of the jews , in which little brick ovens and tendrils of smoke soften a horrific subject other images that similarly eliminate or play dopn the figure are strong , including multistoried interiors like burlesque and house of evil , with their compartmentalized sexual shenanigans , and the domestic freeforall that is the boy magician and there s a frequent penchant for wild distortions of space and perspectival mixings , most notably in othello , last act , an aerial view of the death scene framed by othello s desperate hand , painted large and , appropriately , green but odets s unpredictable talent shines through in a variety of motifs it would be easy to say that the more personal ones are better thus , the jowly , whitehaired personage of \( do n't like this man \) politician does n't hold a candle to the strange confession that is in hell why here the artist mutates his nose into a woman , planting the female form smack in the middle of a red , yellowflecked , wideeyed face animated by a yellow background decorated with redcentered spirals the image almost spins , pivoting around the hallucinating eyes , with help from the subject s long , twisting ear lobes , which , strangely enough , imply both excess and punishment , like something out of dante the jaundiced working at night gives us the lonely , lateworking , slightly debauched writer of odets s journal also good and possibly autobiographical is smoker , which suggests a sendup of the valente photograph in bright fauvish colors but just as often it is hard to say what stimulated odets s imagination chance encounters with real people , news stories or just good old stream of consciousness in this freeranging category , i would place the intense , habited face of the young nun , the stone fortress with a yellow yard of asylum and the mincing , h'ghheeled figure of the straight man another possibility is that many of his figures may have been characters that haunted odets from the plays he constantly meant to be

whether she is acting in a play by samuel beckett or facing a personal crisis , billie whitelaw is fearless in her determination if it is necessary , i will walk through brick walls , she said in a recent interview later , i will collapse with broken bones , but if i 've got to do it , i will do it sam knew that i would turn myself inside out to give him what he wanted the actress s autobiography , billie whitelaw who he \? , published this week by st martin s press , covers her entire life her childhood in coventry , england her marriage to robert muller a writer and drama critic , and their son s almost fatal case of meningitis but half of the book deals with beckett working with him was the defining period of her career were it not for her association with the playwright , she said , nobody would have been remotely interested in my autobiography when she met beckett , in 1963 , it was , she said , trust at first sight that was followed by 25 years of intermittent but intimate collaboration in which ms whitelaw placed her signature on not i , footfalls and rockaby more than any other actor or actress , she came to be regarded as beckett s muse i never did anything with sam without him holding my hand and when he was not present during a production , they would have prolonged telephone conversations i felt as though i was a medium , and very much a part of his creative process after beckett s death in 1989 , ms whitelaw stopped performing his plays , but she visits universities and leads theater students step by step through his work she also does informal onewoman evenings , what she calls chatterbox sessions , in which she talks about her collaboration with the playwright the title of her book refers both to beckett \( who he \? were words spoken by ms whitelaw in play , the first beckett work she did \) and to her own life because of her father s apparently whimsical decision to give her a boy s name , she has had to face that question of identity 'billie , who s he \? ' is a family joke , she said in her autobiography there are only a few stories out of school i certainly was n't going to write about the various affairs i 've had , she said other people do that better , and it s none of their business anyway though not confessional , the autobiography is an intensely personal look behind the public image of this most natural of actresses like so much else in her life , the partnership with beckett began as a matter of chance soon after joining the new national theater , she was asked to do play , in which she , robert stephens and rosemary harris were encased in urns at the time , she was known primarily for playing workingclass characters , roles that led kenneth tynan to call her a female version of albert finney between her first beckett and her second , not i , there was a lapse of nine years during which she played desdemona to laurence olivier s othello and acted in films like charlie bubbles \( with mr finney \) her return to beckett in 1973 was a watershed for not i , she had to stand high on a plinth , with only her spotlighted mouth visible to the audience while she uttered an unstoppable torrent of language overwhelmed by the rigorous physical demands of the role , she broke down at the dress rehearsal beckett said compassionately , oh , billie , what have i done to you \? that response should be taken literally and metaphorically her years of acting beckett have been punishing , leaving her with a damaged spine and a back like a corkscrew but she would n't exchange the experience for anything it has given a purpose to her theatrical life , and it also gives focus to her book because ms whitelaw thinks in pictures and has difficulty writing anything down , she spoke into a tape recorder and then her words were edited by her london publisher she said she had a movie in her mind , and she could throw a switch and arrive at any point in her past all these things i wrote about are as though they happened yesterday , she said i live in my own time warp in the book , she talks about her work as a child actress , joining joan littlewood s theater workshop at the age of 13 later , she goes into detail about her film roles i do n't think people like me become actresses , she said i 've never been a career builder i did n't go to drama school and hardly went to any school at all i do n't know the rules , and neither did sam perhaps that s why we got on so well whenever beckett would ask ms whitelaw to do a play , she and her husband would joke , just about cover the parking fines \( parking her car at whim , she has often been ticketed \) the rewards were , of course , other than financial though they came from contrasting backgrounds , the playwright and the actress struck up an intuitive understanding with all of sam s work , the scream was there , she said , pointing to her stomach my task was to try to get it out beckett would guide her through the plays , as she does now with students , working on voice level and intonation , pauses and breaths , the words not the content during footfalls he said to her , i'm not quite sure the theater is the right place for me anymore i knew what he meant , said ms whitelaw the play was a mixture of painting , music , dance and sculpture it was a whole different art form i felt that we were working with smoke , or weaving a sweater out of cobwebs she said one of the beauties of that production was the gossamer gown designed for her by jocelyn herbert the cleaners threw it away , she said they thought it was a bundle of rags beckett s fate often he would offer terse clues to her characters recording the radio play all that fall , he said that maddy rooney was full of abortive explosiveness , and , hearing that , said ms whitelaw , this creature rose up in her imagination beckett emphasized that maddy had an irish accent i said , 'like yours , ' and he said , 'no , no , no , an irish accent' i realized he did n't know he had an irish accent , and that was the music he heard in his head the last time she saw him , in the final year of his life , they rehearsed his play eh joe at a table in his favorite cafe in paris as usual , he read the play to her and drew a diagram to show her the movement of her character as they talked , she realized that the woman in eh joe was the same woman in krapp s last tape it seemed to me they were real people all these things had happened to sam in recent years , she has acted only in movies and on television i said to my agent , i want short , sharp , wellpaid jobs because i have n't got time for anything else she is often involved in humane causes , and also spends as much time as she can with her son \( now a stage manager with an opera company \) and her infant grandson at home in her cottage in the stour valley , about 90 minutes from london , she looks out at the countryside and at the pheasants that live in her garden sometimes she works in the garden , but , she said , never with tools , digging in with her bare hands as always , she is tactile and gets down to basics i 'll tell you something , she confided , i'm not really interested in acting anymore it s not the center of my life after a beckettian pause , she said , i always thought it was a bit of a flibbertigibbety occupation until i met sam photo billie whitelaw , whose autobiography has just been published \( sara krulwich the new york times \)

boston , jan 12 he said he still is not 100 percent , but as patrick ewing kept pouring in points and rejecting shots by the boston celtics back to the fleet center floor , one had to wonder what a full recovery would mean in only his third game back from an ankle injury , ewing brought his lowpost repertory for eric montross and pervis ellison to peruse when the boston centers were through trying to guard him , ewing had scored 37 points on 15of26 shooting , grabbed 13 rebounds and blocked 5 shots as the knicks defeated the celtics , 10592 it was new york s 13 consecutive victory over boston , the celtics' longest losing streak to any club coach let me play a little bit more and i got into a groove , said ewing , who played 42 minutes i thought we played very well this is what we 're capable of doing when we put our minds to it derek harper said i would n't guard patrick with one person down there it just does n't make sense he s got too much experience and too many moves no sense at all it was a game the knicks \( 2211 \) desperately needed after days of trade talk and their 9279 debacle to the nets on wednesday night it was also a game that was somewhat marred at the end by a bizarre bit of gamesmanship between knicks coach don nelson and celtics coach m l carr in the final seconds with the game already decided , boston s dana barros sought to keep alive his leaguerecord consecutive 3point streak , which had reached 89 games carr believed this was of tantamount importance , so he designed plays for barros near the end of the game but nelson would have none of it , tripleteaming the diminutive guard carr went so far as to call three timeouts in the last eight seconds as the fans stood around wondering what was transpiring nelson , laughing with his players , would not relent anthony mason \( 21 points , 10 rebounds \) blocked two of barros s shots near the end carr , incensed , lofted the ball at nelson and the knicks as they were leaving the floor and took verbal shots at nelson afterward that was kind of fun at the end , nelson said our guys took a lot of pride in not letting him get the 3 m l was having fn he s a friend nelson , a former celtic , was either being sarcastic or naive let s just say i did n't like the way things happened in the end , carr said they had the win and they need to move on it was bush added barros , who was 0 for 9 from beyond the arc i really do n't care i wanted to get it but the only thing i was upset about was that i felt it turned the game into a fiasco ewing was active all evening , bumping montross in the post , using a power dribble to position himself for a turnaround jump shot and dunking spectacularly with the celtics trying to close the gap midway through the third period , he took a touch pass along the baseline from harper off the outofbounds play , leaned in and slammed for a 7770 knicks lead and his 32d point with less than 10 minutes left , he followed up a 19foot jump shot with a monster block on eric williams clearly , his and the knicks' first trip to the fleet center ewing is from nearby cambridge , mass , and had 30 friends and relatives at the game was as productive as many of his trips to boston garden for all the perceived friction on this team , the knicks have won three of their last four but their defense is still suspect at times and their reliance on long jumpers is something that had nelson concentrating on driving to the basket during the morning shootaround the knicks shot only nine free throws in their loss to the nets , relying on deep jumpers with the shot clock winding down instead of putting the ball on the floor by halftime tonight , they had shot 13 , made 9 and led by 5651 of the fracas near the end , the knicks were split i do n't know what that was about , harper said , when asked if it was tacky on both fronts small time is right the bigger issue seemed to be ewing s health patrick is back , harper said he s an allstar center and he took over the game we were able to play off of his playing i do n't know why it was an issue about him ever carrying this team i 've known that since i 've been here rebounds patrick ewing came within 3 points of his seasonhigh 40 , scored against toronto on dec 23 last sunday s knickssonics game that was postponed because of the blizzard has been rescheduled for 12 30 pm april 8 at the garden hubert davis , who was selected to compete in the longdistance shootout portion of the allstar weekend in san antonio next month , will be making his first trip to the allstar game since 1979 it was then that his uncle , the sixtime allstar walter davis , brought him into the locker room of what was then the capital center in landover , md , to meet his allstar teammates that was a dream , hubert said friday you see larry bird and dr j and all these guys in there it was just unbelievable
elizabeth , nj the phone call never came last tuesday night , the longawaited call ringed with rainbows that would justify his coach s obsession , turn his family adviser into his agent and condone his own lackadaisical approach toward schoolwork al hawkins was supposed to be picked in the first or second round of the amateur baseball draft and grab a ride to the show the disappointment is sharp no selection at all , much less a milliondollar bonus sweetfaced , cool al hawkins , 6 feet 2 1 2 inches tall , 210 pounds , is now just an 18yearold senior sweating out his final semester s grades will he make the 20 gradepoint average qualifying him for a division i athletic scholarship \?

an injury in the first game had made this kid his starting varsity quarterback at the time , no one saw a portent in elizabeth s losing that squeaker of a game , despite hawkins s touchdown passes , because of his lapses in the years to come , hawkins would also be a starting guard and leading scorer on coach ben candelino s basketball team and coach ray korn s pitching ace while relations among the coaches were often strained , hawkins loped on from season to season , punctual , teachable , hardworking , trading one ball for another , then invariably carrying it into the postseason , although never quite going all the way was it hawkins , his teammates , his coaches \? i guess if i had concentrated on just one sport , he said last week , i might have gotten really good but i have no regrets i had a lot of fun it would be hard to give up anything he was allcounty and allstate in all three sports , and by his sophomore year his name began cropping up in national scouting reports his fastball was clocked at more than 90 miles an hour you may be great at reading defenses , principal cicarell would nag him , but you 'll be sorry if you do n't start reading books read 'mice and men , ' hawkins said , with the sunny smile that wins him instant pardons and 'color purple' everybody read that one should have read more a combination of laziness and i was always tired after the last football game , the basketball coach would tell him to take a week off , but he 'd show up at the next practice , tired but eager to hone his deadly 3pointer what else was he going to do , stay home with his grandma and his little brother and sister \?

works stolen by the nazis a long list of paintings , sculptures and art objects confiscated from jews by the nazis during world war ii was published 11 years ago by the austrian government , which had kept the art in a monastery in mauerbach since the war s end and was offering heirs a chance to claim the works more than 10 , 000 items have since been identified and returned , but about a thousand objects remain last year , their ownership was transferred to the federation of austrian jewish communities , in cooperation with the committee for jewish claims on austria and the world jewish restitution organization christie s announced this week that it would sell more than 1 , 000 of these works , which were seized from jewish homes mostly in austria from 1938 to 1945 , on behalf of the federation of austrian jewish communities proceeds from the sale , which will be in vienna on oct 29 and 30 , are to benefit both jewish and nonjewish holocaust victims and their families the sale is expected to make about 35 million while the austrian government says it tried to return the artworks for 11 years , some critics say it did n't try hard enough it s the story of the dog that did n't bark , said israel singer , chairman of the world jewish restitution organization and secretary general of the world jewish congress this sale is an awareness campaign of all the art that was plundered that was n't returned it s 50 years too late and 50 years too little walter greinert , the austrian consul general , said yes , it s taken a long time and i am sorry about that , but the austrian authorities have done all they could there were three stages of distribution of the mauerbach goods the first was when the allied forces handed over many of the art and objects to the austrian government to distribute in the late 1950 s then in the 1960 s , the austrian authorities advertised worldwide asking that the rightful owners claim their objects restitution was opened again in the 1980 s we are glad that the problem has been solved to the satisfaction of the jewish organizations items offered for sale will include 19thcentury paintings , old master paintings and drawings , as well as carpets , tapestries , furniture , arms and armor , coins and literature none of the works are of museum quality had they been , experts say , they would have been given to a museum by now christie s is forfeiting its usual fees we were called in by the jewish restitution organization in 1986 to have a look at the material stored in mauerbach , stephen lash , vice chairman of christie s in america we thought this was a way of righting some wrongs the sale is also good public relations for the auction house among the important christie s clients involved in organizing the sale is ronald lauder , the chairman of the museum of modern art , treasurer of the world jewish congress and head of the committee that will oversee the distribution of the sale s proceeds the popularity of american art so much attention is focused on the impressionist , modern and contemporary art auctions , which are a traditional bellwether of the market but meanwhile , the popularity of american art keeps growing last week christie s had its best sale ever and sotheby s did well , too both auctions , in fact , outperformed the auction houses' evening sales of contemporary art we saw two trends , said andrew schoelkopf , who heads christie s department of american art there were new buyers who had never bid at auction before and then there were people buying 100 , 000 pictures who had previously bought 10 , 000 ones mr schoelkopf also attributes this spring s success to christie s marketing efforts for the first time , it advertised in publications like variety , the hollywood reporter and the new yorker record prices were set at both sales of the two auction houses , sotheby s took in more its sales totaled 223 million christie s was n't far behind , with 193 million the topselling painting was john singer sargent s capri girl , a portrait of rosina ferrara that he painted in capri in 1878 it was estimated to sell for 3 million to 4 million , and brought 48 million from an unidentified collector at sotheby s despite the reported new buyers , those snapping up the most expensive paintings were all seasoned collectors one was daniel j terra , founder of the museum of american art in giverny while christie s refused to confirm the report , american art experts say mr terra was the buyer of its two top sellers mary cassatt s in the box \( circa 1879 \) and john la farge s paradise valley \( 18661868 \) the cassatt , from the estate of edgar and helen hope montgomery scott , brought 4 million , more than three times its 12 million high estimate and a record for an oil painting by the artist the la farge , a landscape of newport , ri , sold for 22 million , also a record and well above its 800 , 000 high estimate \( final prices include the auction house

sears , roebuck company agreed yesterday to buy the orchard supply hardware stores corporation for 308 million as part of a rapid national expansion of its chain of hardware stores orchard , based in san jose , calif , has 61 hardware stores , all in california sears has 115 hardware stores in 14 markets east of the mississippi , but none in california the company has said it may have as many as 500 hardware stores nationwide by the end of the century brokerage analysts generally praised the strategy in sears s acquisition of orchard it makes perfect sense it s going to be a very nice supplement to sears s existing business , said kimberly k walin , a retail industry analyst at furman selz , a new york brokerage firm sears did not have an existing california business , so orchard is a very good fit under the terms of the offer , which was approved by orchard s board , sears will pay 35 a share for all of orchard s 88 million shares , or 308 million sears will also assume about 107 million of orchard s debt freeman spogli company , the leveraged buyout firm that acquired orchard in 1989 and is still its largest shareholder , has agreed to tender its 16 million shares , which represent 182 percent of the company shares of orchard jumped 5 yesterday , to 3475 , on the new york stock exchange sears shares fell 25 cents , to 44625 i think sears got a steal , said aram rubinson , an analyst with paine webber , another new york brokerage firm this accelerates sears s push into this offthemall retail strategy that , he explained , means more hardware stores outside typical locations george c strachan , retail analyst at goldman , sachs company , said , strategically , it s a very wellconceived transaction , but in the big picture this is a fairly small event that is because the acquisition of orchard , which has a little over 500 million in sales , will not have much effect on the earnings of a giant like sears but , mr strachan said , it should more than double sears s standalone hardware stores , get it into california immediately , and allow it to use its private brands , such as sears craftsman tools and diehard , more extensively by combining the strengths of orchard and sears hardware stores , we will accelerate the growth of our successful offthemall hardware business , arthur c martinez , sears s chairman and chief executive , said in a press statement , referring to the strategy of developing more stores outside typical mall locations mr martinez , 56 , took the helm at sears in august 1995 , and has shaken up sears , cutting its work force , while focusing on its more profitable retail businesses jan drummond , a sears spokeswoman , said the orchard acquisition preempted a national expansion plan for its hardware stores , which would not have included california until 1998 or 1999 we have no sears hardware stores in california , she added this whole offthemall business is our fastestgrowing business our growth strategy is focused on nonmall locations sears currently has no plans to change the name of orchard supply , ms drummond said orchard said yesterday that its earnings for its second quarter , which ended july 28 , grew by 5 percent , to 59 million , from 56 million in the period a year earlier , while sales rose 113 percent , to 1619 million from 1455 million
baghdad , iraq , dec 15 from a baghdad storefront today , khalid alzuweidi measured out government rations for each of 136 families in his charge , scooping out flour , sugar and rice according to strict prescription but for the first time in six years , he did so with a hope that next month the portions will be bigger with a limited amount of iraqi oil starting to flow to foreign buyers for the first time since the persian gulf war in 1991 , the iraqi government has promised as part of a deal with the united nations to fatten the meager package that has become the main source of sustenance for most of the country s 20 million people but redemption of that promise may have to wait until revenue from new contracts reaches a special united nations account , and that has left ordinary iraqis to wonder when they will witness the alchemy that promises to turn oil to food everyone wants to know when will the un food come \? said mr zuweidi , a 50yearold grocer for the iraqi government , this has been a week of celebration on tuesday , it began to pump oil to turkey through a pipeline that had been closed since august 1990 , when iraq invaded kuwait it opened a second outlet today in the southern port of basra with the loading of a persian gulf tanker with oil that iraq said was bound for two american companies and suddenly , the lobby of the governmentowned al rashid hotel , the best in the capital , is crowded with french , italian , russian and other foreign businessmen who have hurried to iraq in hopes of securing a contract to buy oil or to sell food and other goods that iraq will be able to buy up in return most walk with nary a glance across a portrait of george bush inlaid on the entryway floor that until recently was covered by a rug but is once again being displayed with a gulf warera epithet denouncing mr bush as a criminal without exception , government newspapers have portrayed the resumption of oil exports as the beginning of the end for the sixyearold embargo imposed by the united nations after iraq invaded kuwait but it is far from clear how and whether the easing of the ban on oil sales will change the complexion of iraq , whose economy remains shattered and whose people have suffered greatly as a result of the strict united nations sanctions minutes after the deal was announced last week , hundreds of celebrating iraqis fired weapons that set baghdad s skies athunder , and people interviewed in markets and cafes and on downtown streets said they were in good spirits all said their lot would improve under the accord , and some said they expected the increased ration to cover their families' basic needs for the first time since the invasion of kuwait pitted their country against most of the world but some basic foods like meat , cheese , eggs and milk will not be included even in the augmented monthly package , which the government says will be all that it can afford and having lived comfortably before the persian gulf war , many of those interviewed said they remained bitter at the prospect that ordinary iraqis must still bear the burden of an international campaign that the united states and its allies have said is aimed not at them but at iraq s leader , president saddam hussein do they want to keep us hungry \? asked mohammed nuamen youssef , a shabbily dressed 60yearold who spoke amid the dust and din of the outdoor shorjah bazaar even the new ration will not be enough i am a retired government official , and my pension is only enough for two eggs is that logical \? it is just such ordinary citizens who are intended to be comforted by the new accord , which was approved in new york last week after nearly a year of haggling it will allow iraq to sell only about onefifth as much oil as it sold before the war under the terms of the united nations accord , about 132 billion in revenue from the 2 billion in oil that iraq will be permitted to sell in the next six months will be set aside for the purchase of food , medicine and other essential aid under united nations supervision as soon as it can purchase the new supplies , the government announced last week , it will increase the ration of each of the six basic foods it provides to its citizens by a substantial share for each person , the monthly allotment of rice is to increase from about three pounds to more than five , for instance , while the sacks of flour doled out to every family will include nearly 20 pounds per person , up from about 15 international health officials , who have criticized the current ration as woefully inadequate , say malnutrition and inadequate medical care resulting from the sanctions have contributed to the deaths of more than 4 , 500 iraqi children each year a united nations official in baghdad said today that the new handout would be enough to provide about 2 , 020 calories a day , sufficient for minimum nutritional requirements but not much more than the world food program provides to refugees but gualtiero fulcheri , an italian who is the united nations' humanitarian coordinator for iraq , said he could not predict when the iraqi government will be able to increase the ration under the united nations plan , which specifies that all revenue from the oil sales be put in escrow in a special united nations account in an interview here , mr fulcheri said it would be several weeks at the earliest before iraqis received augmented rations , and he suggested that the lag could be far longer unless suppliers prove willing to sell to iraq on credit everyone is working at full speed , both on the government and the agency side , mr fulcheri said but he added that there would be a certain slowness in starting up until the gulf war , iraq never had to resort to a ration system , and even after six years of collecting their allotment every month , many iraqis are still uncomfortable with the procedure but the collapse in the value of the iraqi currency , the dinar , under united nations sanctions has left few with any choice but to present their coupons to grocers like mr zuweidi , who keeps close records that show that none of the families in his neighborhood have ever let their allotment go unclaimed an initial fall and then a precipitous rise in food prices here recently have stunned ordinary iraqis , whose initial glow of good will about the partial lifting of sanctions has clearly begun to subside even if there has been a fault , all faults can be corrected , said mr youssef , the retired government official , who like many iraqis says it is now long past time for the all of the sanctions still in effect against iraq to be lifted six years is quite enough photo merchants in a market in baghdad , which is to get more food \( associated press \) \( pg a1 \) map of iraq \( pg a11 \)
when telecommunications inc , the nation s largest cable television operator , announced the suspension of most of its new hardware orders last month , it was a loss of face for the cable giant but for small makers of cable equipment like the tsx corporation , which counts telecommunications as its largest customer , the news was an even bigger blow in this industry there have been more promises made and broken than you can think about , said william h lambert , chairman of tsx , which is based in el paso when they get a cold , we get pneumonia for tsx and many other companies that make components for advanced video systems , 1996 has been a sickly year so far , the oncegrandiose plans of cable operators and their telephone company competitors to bring a new generation of interactive television into homes across the united states mostly have remained only that plans true , some cable television companies and regional bell operating companies are building futuristic residential networks including combinations of interactive television programming , highspeed internet access and telephone service but none of these projects have been expanded beyond limited test areas it s a big struggle for all cable and video suppliers , said w john aronsohn , an analyst at the yankee group in boston it s hard to keep your business alive while operators announce plans and cancel plans and revise plans as sales sag after years of doubledigit growth , wall street is growing impatient stock prices are near 52week lows for some companies that make and distribute parts for socalled broadband networks , including antec , broadband technologies , general instrument and tsx since may , shares of scientificatlanta inc , another major equipment maker , have lost about 25 percent of their value , closing friday at 15125 such are the difficulties of dashed expectations a lot of these problems have to do with john malone talking about 500 channels three and four years ago , said timothy p savageaux , an analyst at robertson , stephens company , referring to the president of telecommunications we 've all been waiting for this rising tide and it still is n't here many cable television and telephone company executives say that the manufacturers ultimately have themselves to blame for underestimating the difficulty of providing households with hundreds of video channels , movies on demand , highspeed internet access and telephone service all through one costeffective copper wire or coaxial cable in 1995 , it became evident that my ability to lay cable was outstripping the suppliers' ability to provide all the hardware , said timothy s harden , pacific bell s vice president of broadband deployment the company , a unit of pacific telesis that provides telephone service in california and nevada , is now delivering cable television to a few thousand customers in the san jose , calif , area as part of an ambitious plan to replace its entire telephonewire network with a system based on coaxial cable the development of fullservice networks proved harder to do than most suppliers believed , mr harden said such essential components of broadband networks as highspeed cable modems and digital settop boxes for home televisions are only now becoming available in quantities and at prices that service providers find acceptable mr harden said that any current approach to broadband deployment now costs about 1 , 000 a household in contrast to pacific bell s plan to move to coaxial cable , bell atlantic , the east coast phone giant , champions a rival technology called switched digital video that technology , which bell atlantic says can transmit huge amounts of voice , data and video traffic through conventional telephone wires , was developed by broadband technologies and lucent technologies beginning next summer , bell atlantic plans to convert 600 , 000 of its 11 million households to the new system yearly like mr harden , mark a wegleitner , bell atlantic s vice president for broadband projects , said his company would have proceeded earlier if suppliers had delivered costeffective equipment but even the equipment makers who acknowledge that research and development have taken longer than planned say the situation springs from factors beyond their control take salim a l bhatia , chief executive of broadband technologies , which makes video transmission equipment for switched digital video networks and has lost more than half of its market value since may , closing on friday at 17125 a share on nasdaq mr bhatia said the baby bells had simply been slow to recognize his products' technical appeal other equipment makers contend that the baby bells are more focused on entering the lucrative longdistance business than on upgrading their local networks a contention the bells vigorously deny some manufacturers also note that a big portion of the federal communications commission s new rules for local telephone competition is now hung up in a federal court the question is , when will the legislation and regulation be settled and we can just let the market run , said james a bauer , a vice president of the antec corporation the stock of antec , a maker and distributor of cable equipment , has lost almost half its value since february , ending friday at 10 despite the delays , equipment buyers and equipment sellers agree that new broadband networks will eventually find their way across the country the question is when next year , next year this has always been a nextyear story , said david t parrish , a telecommunications analyst at advest inc , a regional brokerage firm in boston but at some point this story will work mr savageaux , the robertson , stephens analyst , predicted that network modernization would accelerate when true competition began besides the greed factor , the only other thing to get these guys to invest is the fear factor , mr savageaux said if you do n't

they were planned before nuclear became a bad word twin reactors expected to supply cheap , clean energy to new jersey it was the late 1970 s , before chernobyl brought fear , and energy deregulation made them less attractive but the salem reactors , managed and predominantly owned by public service electric gas company , are on the ropes dogged by structural problems and mismanagement , they have not lived up to their promise of cheap , safe power this year the two units ranked among 2 of the 10 worst reactors in the country , according to public citizen , an environmental watchdog group salem 1 ranked first on the list the reactors have drawn more than a dozen fines from the nuclear regulatory commission in the last 15 years , and neither has been operating since spring 1995 because of safety concerns their problems at salem come to a head as the new jersey board of public utilities is reviewing options for deregulation of the state s energy market within the next five to seven years currently , new jersey depends on nuclear power for 40 percent of its needs , but the history and fate of the salem site may say a good deal about where new jersey will head in the next two decades , in an uncertain future in which utilities are expected to compete with one another for both customers and power salem s latest shutdown , one of 22 at the site , resulted in pseg s offer on wednesday of credits to ratepayers taling 839 million these rebates , which will be disbursed in early 1997 if approved by the state board of public utilities , roughly equal the amount paid by consumers that exceeded replacement energy costs the company also promised not to seek reimbursement of another 12 million it spent on replacement energy but more important , said michael ambrosio , executive director of the board of public utilities , the settlement departs from the past practice of allowing utilities to charge ratepayers even for plants that were not operating under the settlement , if the plants are not up and running within two years , the utility will have to absorb the cost of keeping them idle we have shifted the risk of operating the plant to the utility , he said it changes the way we regulate the nuclear industry and is more reflective of what a competitive market would be consumer groups and environmentalists say that the new jersey board of public utilities has ducked the more important issue of whether the plants should even be allowed to operate they note that salem 1 is about to undergo a 200 million overhaul to replace faulty steam generators salem 2 , which is newer , has also had generator problems we want them closed because they are not only dangerous but economically useless , said staci berger , the utilities organizer for new jersey citizen action , the state s largest consumer group these plants have worked only about half the time they have been up , and have a dismal safety record and once deregulation comes , we 're worried they will let safety go right out the window in an attempt to compete the board of public utilities says the nuclear regulatory commission would continue to monitor safety issues even under deregulation critics do n't find this argument convincing , noting that the commission has found it necessary to fine pseg 15 million since salem has been operating , 680 , 000 of it for failure to fix already cited safety violations or for harassing inspectors who reported safety violations despite the fines , a pseg spokesman , neil brown , said , public safety has never been compromised mr brown said pseg itself was worried about how deregulation would affect safety the financial viability of the company operating these facilities needs to be maintained so that there is never an issue of safety being compromised for financial reasons , he said noting that nuclear reactors were once encouraged by states as a clean source of fuel , many utility analysts say it is unlikely that the utilities that built them will be forced to swallow the cost of their inefficiencies or of shutting them down another problem is that even if reactors cannot compete with the lowcost kilowattage of other energy sources , like natural gas , new jersey has no other options that provide the amount of constant power the state requires energy can be conserved dirty power can be imported for coalfired cogeneration plants , and there is also gas but none of this can be depended on to meet all of new jersey s needs there has to be some commitment to providing power to the region long term so you have to look beyond simple dollars and cents , said barry abramson , a utilities analyst with prudential securities inc and weighing all the different factors , if these reactors begin to operate in the way most do , they can be efficient resources because of the indirect benefits like pollution abatement and the security of having a plant not dependent on the spot market for purchasing power
a recent survey of brokerage firms found startling differences in the commissions paid by investors for the same services , with the paine webber group charging seven times as much as the deepdiscount brokerage firm , wall street equities , on a comparable trade the survey , by the national council of individual investors , included the 10 largest fullservice , bankaffiliated and discount brokerages as well as the deepdiscount firms that charge the lowest commissions the study assessed commissions on a trade of 500 listed shares at 10 each , and clearly showed a huge difference in commissions , said gerri detweiler , the policy director for the council , which was created by state securities regulators in november as an advocate for small investors the survey , conducted in january and february , also found huge differences in fees charged for various services while investors might typically turn to one of the large discount brokerages , expecting the best bargains , the discounters may not be as good a deal as investors might expect , ms detweiler said six bank brokerages , including first interstate securities , wachovia investments and first union brokerage services , charged less in commissions for the same transaction than did two discounters , charles schwab and fidelity brokerage services , the survey found commissions also varied widely , depending on the type of transaction investors who favor small nasdaq stocks , for example , paid as little at fullservice firms like bear , stearns company and dean witter reynolds as they did at discounters like kennedy , cabot company , marsh block company , waterhouse securities and pc financial network , according to the survey but commissions are not the only costs investors must consider in looking for a bargain other fees can substantially add to an investor s costs , and one firm might charge a fee for one service but not for another a lot of times you do n't know unless you ask , ms detweiler said wall street equities , the deep discounter , for example , charges a 25 registrationanddelivery fee , a 25 wiretransfer fee , a 15 latepayment fee and other fees , according to the survey , while lehman brothers , a fullservice firm , does not key investments and banc one securities , two of the bank brokerages , also charge a multitude of fees buyandhold investors would do well to check on whether the brokerage they use charges them when they fail to make a trade within a given time while most firms do not levy an inactivity fee when investors fail to make at least one trade a year , dean witter reynolds , smith barney , prudential securities , nations securities and national discount brokers charge them a 50 inactivity fee , according to the survey pacific brokerage services inc will simply close the account starting and maintaining an individual retirement account is also significantly less expensive at some firms than at others while only one of the fullservice firms and none of the bank brokerage firms charges an investor for setting up an account , according to the survey , pacific brokerage services charges investors 65 for the service keeping an ira account at these firms also varies in cost some brokerages , like citicorp investment services kennedy , cabot company lombard institutional brokerage olde discount stockbrokers , and waterhouse securities , do not charge an annual fee to maintain the account , according to the survey but the 40 annual fee charged by smith barney , first interstate securities and pacific brokerage services can add up over a period of 20 or 30 years the council also compared the disciplinary track record of the fullservice brokerage firms , looking at the number of arbitration cases per broker and the amount of awards per broker over the last six years while the average award per broker for prudential securities topped 8 , 000 , edward d jones had average awards of only 8680 investors might use that information to help assess how much faith they want to put into the advice of a given firm , ms detweiler said even if investors do not want to use the survey to shop around for a new firm , they can use the information to negotiate with their current broker i also hope investors will use the survey , if they 're paying too much , to ask for a better deal , she said copies of the survey are available for 5 by calling 18006638516 or by writing to brokerage survey , national council of individual investors , 1900 l street nw , suite 610 , washington , dc , 20036 the council ranks fullservice and bankaffiliated brokerage firms based on a combination of services offered , commissions and fees and other considerations table comparison shopping list highest , lowest , and averagebrokerage commissions and ira fees among categories of brokerage firms , according to a survey of 38 brokerages \( source national council of individual investors \)
to the editor in gay marriage , an oxymoron \( oped , march 23 \) , lisa schiffren argues that marriage is a lifelong compact between partners committed to sexual exclusivity and the creation and nurture of offspring if this were so , fertile couples who forswear parenthood would surely be deprived of the legal advantages \( tax treatment , inheritance , employee benefits \) that exist to help couples raise children ms schiffren would deny these benefits even to those gay couples \( whose existence she acknowledges \) who have children , while paradoxically asserting that society has wisely chosen not to differentiate between marriages in granting licenses regardless of a heterosexual couple s childrearing intentions only a trick of cognitive dissonance allows the judeochristian moral order to tolerate homosexuals at all , she says after reading her strained arguments against gay marriage , i conclude that in her capacity for cognitive dissonance ms schiffren is second to none mark eckenwiler chicago , march 27 , 1996
from green algae pills to coffee enemas , from acupuncture to aromatherapy , alternative medical treatments have grown into a big business and a powerful force in modern medicine , alarming many in the medical establishment and largely escaping scrutiny from regulators although folk remedies have been around for centuries , often coexisting with the treatments offered by orthodox medicine , medical experts say that over the past 10 years , more people have been turning to more kinds of alternative therapies than ever before a national telephone survey , published in the new england journal of medicine in 1993 , found that one of three americans used unconventional therapies , which can range from taking vitamin c for a cold to going to mexican clinics for outlawed cancer treatments the survey also found that americans spent 137 billion in 1991 on such treatments another national survey , published in 1994 , found that 60 percent of doctors had at some time referred patients to practitioners of alternative medicine the highly prestigious beth israel hospital in boston , which is associated with harvard medical school , recently set up a center for alternative medicine , as did columbia university and five years ago , the federal office of alternative medicine was established as part of the national institutes of health to provide the public with information on alternative treatments and to find out what works a growing number of health insurance companies , which increasingly set the standards for care , now cover once obscure treatments like naturopathy practitioners of naturopathy say that disease arises from blockages in the flow of a life force through the body and that cures follow from treatments like acupuncture and homeopathy , treating patients with infinitesimal amounts of substances that in larger doses might produce symptoms of disease meanwhile , many makers of alternative remedies have been reporting record sales this financial growth is a direct result , analysts say , of a 1994 federal law curbing the regulation of the industry by the food and drug administration many doctors , scientists and government officials sharply criticize the practice of alternative medicine , saying that at best it does no harm and at its worst can do real danger while conventional medicine adopts procedures that are consistent with established scientific hypotheses , and drugs must be stringently tested and approved by the fda , alternative medicine practitioners can use therapies based on whims or discredited science , and their methods have not undergone rigorous tests the critics of alternative medicine point to reports about the dangers posed by some alternative treatments herbal preparations like ma huang , used in dietary supplements and in widely available moodaltering products , have caused deaths , as have coffee enemas , said to treat cancer and other diseases by detoxifying the body the national heart , lung and blood institute has documented cases of kidney failure and death in people who have had chelation therapy the intravenous injection of the synthetic chelating agent edta advertised as a treatment for heart disease and ailments like parkinson s disease , alzheimer s and sexual impotency the very name alternative medicine is orwellian newspeak , implying that it is a viable option , said dr marcia angell , executive editor of the new england journal of medicine it s a new name for snake oil , she said there s medicine that works and medicine that does n't work dr arthur caplan , director of the center for bioethics at the university of pennsylvania , said , some say , 'look , why not let desperately ill people do what they want \? why stand between them and the latest piece of shark cartilage \? ' but he disagrees dr caplan is gravely concerned , he said , that because of alternative medicine , some patients will reject reliable mainstream treatments practitioners of alternative medicine , he said , encourage patients to think that somehow , just by being out of the mainstream , nothing is risky or really dangerous or has side effects it is , he said , ridiculous to say that chemotherapy can cause side effects but chelation therapy or coffee enemas , that s completely without risk alternative medicine encompasses a range of treatments outside those commonly accepted by the medical establishment generally , such treatments have not passed clinical trials although many medicinal herbs have pharmacologically active components , the focus of alternative medicine is not to isolate and test those ingredients alternative medicine includes therapies offered by chiropractors , acupuncturists and homeopaths also included may be treatments like aromatherapy , the use of aromatic oils for relaxation , which is also promoted as a cure for hundreds of diseases alternative medicines include herbs , taken for various ills green algae pills , said to foster alertness , and shark cartilage , promoted as a natural cure for cancer
pontiac , mich , may 14 dr jack kevorkian today was found not guilty of violating michigan common law against assisted suicide , closing two cases that his lawyers said were by far the most significant of the five acquittals he has won at three trials the jury saved me , said dr kevorkian , who appeared deeply moved just before the oakland county circuit court jury announced its verdict , dr kevorkian , a retired pathologist , said over lunch in the courthouse cafeteria that he was beginning to fear he would be convicted moments later , his meal was interrupted by news of the verdict what this proves is that while this may be a sin to you , dr kevorkian said to reporters minutes later , one thing is clear for any enlightened human being , this can never be a crime his main lawyer , geoffrey fieger , said this will be the last kevorkian trial despite a blatant attempt by the prosecution and certain judges to rig this trial , the jury saw through it thank god for the jury system lawrence bunting , the chief assistant prosecutor who argued the case , would not say whether his office would again charge dr kevorkian , who assisted in his 28th suicide between sessions on the witness stand last week but michael modelski , a former oakland county assistant prosecutor who is a kevorkian foe , agreed that this would probably be the last time dr kevorkian would be tried for assisting in a suicide prosecutors have not filed charges against him in the last eight suicides he has attended , and this case was the last outstanding proceeding against him this trial was considerably different from the two earlier trials at which dr kevorkian was acquitted those trials one in detroit in 1994 and the other here early this year were prosecuted under a nowexpired michigan law that law forbidding anyone from assisting in suicides did not apply if a doctor caused death while trying to administer medications or procedures to relieve pain and suffering the three people who dr kevorkian assisted in suicide in those cases were also indisputably terminally ill he was acquitted today in the deaths of marjorie wantz , 58 , and sherry miller , 43 , who died side by side on oct 23 , 1991 , in a cabin in a bald mountain state recreation area mrs miller , who died by breathing carbon monoxide through a mask , had multiple sclerosis , which prosecutors said was not fatal mrs wantz , who used a lethal injection machine dr kevorkian invented , had been in constant pain from a series of bungled surgeries to remove her vulva even dr kevorkian conceded that her condition was not terminal originally , the oakland county prosecutor , richard thompson , sought to charge dr kevorkian , 67 , with murder in the deaths , but judge david breck of oakland county circuit court dismissed the cases , ruling that the women had killed themselves and finding that michigan had no law against assisted suicide three years later , in december 1994 , the michigan supreme court ruled that assisted suicide had always been a commonlaw crime , or one that was based on custom rather than legislated , and the case was reopened legal scholars in the state said no known precedent existed for the court s ruling mr fieger said the trial , which began on april 1 , stemmed from a desire by the courts to stop at nothing to get dr kevorkian the trial was frequently delayed and saw 13 appeals by the prosecution to the michigan court of appeals , nearly all of which were upheld the jury instructions as written by the judge were also promptly modified by the michigan court of appeals in a way that seemed to mandate a conviction , as long as it was proved that dr kevorkian by some act assisted the suicide that he had done so was never seriously disputed , though dr kevorkian maintained that his only intent had been to relieve their pain and suffering their death was just an unfortunate but necessary consequence of the only way that could be done , he said but his defense was based mainly on the argument that the idea of trying dr kevorkian for breaking common law was improper there ai n't no law , dr kevorkian shouted on the witness stand i only recognize laws passed by a legislature , not made up by courts his lawyers noted there had been no prior cases of using common law to prosecute assisted suicide they said the higher court s discovery of the commonlaw offense three years after the fact was outrageous after the verdict , seven members of the sixwoman , sixman jury indicated that those arguments had been telling one of them , mary hess , 59 , a technical worker for a suburban school system , said she initially believed the doctor was guilty but over the weekend , ms hess said , as she was raking leaves in her yard , i realized i did n't want someone to come along three years from now and say that raking leaves back then was illegal , you just did n't know it when the case went to the jury on thursday , the jurors said they initially voted 7 to 4 for acquittal , with 1 juror undecided later , the vote was 9 to 2 , they said , and shortly before noon today the last holdouts switched we had a hard time understanding the common law , said the jury foreman , dean gauthier , 38 , a manager at an automobile dealership , and what it came down to was a belief that the prosecution had not proven beyond a reasonable doubt that he had broken it cameron beedle , a 39yearold waitress on the jury , said she wanted to see any law written down in black and white , before convicting anyone another juror , vincent muscillo , 20 , a locksmith , said none of the jurors had any doubt that the dead women s decision was their own all jurors said they were moved by the videotapes the two women made in which they talked of their misery and begged to be allowed to die none said they thought the fact that the women were not terminally ill was an issue dr kevorkian declined to attend a victory dinner it s my poker night , he said , managing a grin
bethesda , md , dec 12 dr david baltimore , a nobel laureate microbiologist at the massachusetts institute of technology , will lead an effort to revitalize the nation s drive to develop an aids vaccine , the national institutes of health announced today dr william paul , director of the federal office of aids research at the institutes , said dr baltimore would be the chairman of a committee to look for new ideas for such development , reinvigorating research that after more than a decade has failed to produce an effective immunization against the disease david baltimore will have a large role in creating a new agenda , dr paul said in an interview we need some creativity , some new ideas , and he will give us this because of who he is and the fact that he wants to do it the appointment of dr baltimore came in response to a major study of the nation s aids research effort the study , by a panel of 114 leading scientists and others concerned about aids , concluded earlier this year that the government s research program , whose annual cost is almost 15 billion , lacked focus and needed an overhaul that panel , of which dr baltimore was a member , said a vaccine research committee headed by a distinguished nongovernment scientist should be created to provide direction and oversight the group also said the national institutes of health should establish a new aids vaccine program that combined , in new and creative ways , related research conducted at several of the agency s branches research scientists , advocates for aids patients and critics of current efforts to develop a vaccine against hiv , the virus that causes aids , praised dr baltimore s appointment as chairman of the new vaccine research advisory committee , which has been given a mandate to look for new , even unorthodox , approaches derek hodel , public policy director of the gay men s health crisis , said the appointment was an important and timely step dr baltimore has long advocated matching the boldest minds against hiv , mr hodel said mark harrington of the treatment action group , in new york city , said today s announcement is a big shot in the arm for aids research dr baltimore has the experience , the vision and the insight to reinvigorate the search for a safe and effective aids vaccine and dr harold varmus , director of the national institutes of health , said , david baltimore will make a difference in the early years of the aids epidemic , researchers hoped to develop a vaccine against the disease within a few years by using techniques developed earlier to create vaccines against polio and other viral diseases hiv , however , which constantly mutates and has the ability to hide in different body tissues for years , has proved more difficult more than 15 vaccines have been tested since 1988 in trials in the united states involving more than 2 , 000 subjects who were not infected with hiv , but none has shown much effect dr paul , director of the office of aids research , said that the effort had resulted in some progress , if slow , and that the failure to find a good preventive so far did not invalidate past work it s quite feasible , he said , that the vaccines we have been developing will end up being effective , but we have to look at new approaches aids is not unique in thwarting efforts to develop a vaccine , he said , noting that a century of research had failed to produce a vaccine against tuberculosis and that decades of efforts , and promising candidates , had not resulted in a vaccine against malaria dr baltimore said in an interview that he would first review the hiv vaccine program at the national institutes and make sure his committee knew what had been done and what was in progress then , he said , i will try to organize regional meetings around the country to ferret out vaccine ideas we want to hear from anyone with new ideas noting that efforts to develop an aids vaccine had been declining among pharmaceutical companies , dr baltimore said he also planned to ask industry for suggestions about basic research the government could perform to aid the private sector his new position is the first for dr baltimore outside the university since the end of a science fraud case in which , although he was only indirectly involved , his reputation took a beating the case involved accusations that an mit colleague , dr theresa imanishikari , had falsified data included in a paper of which she and dr baltimore were coauthors government investigators exonerated dr imanishikari of the accusations earlier this year , but the controversy , during which dr baltimore had defended her , cost him prestige and the presidency of rockefeller university dr baltimore said today that he did not consider his appointment a sign either that his reputation had somehow needed rehabilitating or that he was now being brought back into the mainstream of science i 've never considered myself to be out of the mainstream , he said , and i'm glad to have an opportunity to contribute people can speculate on other issues if they wish
seattle , june 12 the mountain is now a molehill no national basketball association team has ever overcome a threegamestonone playoff deficit , but the seattle supersonics officially became a nuisance tonight they postponed michael jordan s thursday golf game the chicago bulls had champagne on ice and a charter waiting on the runway , but that is what airport hangars are for the sonics , who were in no rush to divide playoff shares , shared the basketball instead and found a hero on their clubhouse treadmill nate mcmillan cannot bend over and touch his toes , but those were the sonics on his shoulders tonight the nerve of his sciatic nerve pain has been resonating from mcmillan s lower back to his left hamstring for two weeks now , but he played 14 literally spinetingling minutes tonight he made two 3point bombs \( i can shoot the ball without pain i do n't have to jump , he said \) and he let his teammate gary payton out of pointguard prison in the sonics' 10786 victory over the bulls payton is an off guard in a point guard s body , and with mcmillan handling the ball at the top of the key and distributing like a member of the united states post office payton was free to be himself payton ran his defender , michael jordan , through a myriad of screens , posted jordan up and took jordan out to 3point land payton scored 21 points , lobbed to shawn kemp whenever possible and became his old motormouth self how was this possible \? nate , nate mcmillan , payton said mcmillan , a sonic for a decade , had missed games 2 and 3 of this series , but played tonight because i have a whole summer to rest besides , it s more inspirational to my team when i'm in a sonic uniform instead of a nice suit a lot of the guys , i saw a glow in their faces when they saw me tonight gary told me it motivated him even more he held three intriguing and private discussions today that persuaded him to play and then he persuaded the clubhouse man to leave the treadmill motor running first , mcmillan asked his wife , michelle , if he should play , and she told him to take his body for a test drive before the game and then decide next , he asked his brother , randy , if he should play , and randy mcmillan said , yes , you idiot well , nate mcmillan said late tonight , my brother said , 'play' no hesitation from him he was almost , you 're playing regardless' he was n't feeling sorry for me like my wife was he was , 'play , dude' next , he did not ask his coach if he should play he told his coach he was playing he said , 'i want to dress , ' coach george karl said no way i was n't going to play him i mean , i 've said all along , nate is the glue to this team i do n't know if he can play like that in game 5 , but nate gives us confidence he gives gary the opportunity to run around the way we need him to run around the mirage of the mcmillan injury is that he can walk without a limp but he cannot trot without a limp he could not finish a 40yard dash if he tried , which is why he said tonight , if this were 3 on 3 , half court , i 'd be cool but sometimes these are halfcourt games mcmillan loped up the court and drained an arching 3pointer to cap a 142 seattle run that ripped the game open in the second quarter then , he drilled another 3pointer when the bulls were within 13 points in the third when he was removed from the game each time the second time after scottie pippen and mcmillan collided , tweaking his back he kept on running straight to the locker room he could not bear to sit down he might never have got up so he charged straight to the clubhouse to stretch and walk on the treadmill he walked , he estimated , about five miles and now the sonics are maybe only three miles behind the bulls before tonight s victory , there was gallows humor in the seattle locker room karl said he had run out of pep talks \( what , you wanted knute rockne \? he said \) , and when he told payton he had to cover no 23 on the bulls , his only advice to payton was , good luck but now there is a game 5 where there used to be a jordan round of 18 holes what does my team have to do to show it has class \? karl said beat chicago four straight \? i 'll take that

almost 200 white tourists , most of them europeans , had been standing outside the abyssinian baptist church in harlem for 45 minutes on a recent sunday morning when one of the three ushers in charge of crowd control broke the bad news picking a point about threequarters down the line , the usher , roger feggins , politely informed the tourists beyond it that there would not be enough seats for them at the 11 am service , and that they would have to go around the corner to a different black church they can take you there , mr feggins said but a huddle of four swedish tourists refused to budge i'm sorry , mr feggins said no movement i'm not playing games , mr feggins said nothing finally , one of his adversaries piped up ca n't we stand \? asked erik blennberger , his face betraying the panic of a theatergoer who had been intent on rent but was being asked to settle for cats you 're being outrageous , mr feggins said you 're not respecting me this is a church but to mr blennberger , it was something more and something less a highlighted entry in his swedish guidebook , a mustsee for any swede doing the big apple it was abyssinian or bust so two minutes into the standoff , mr feggins threw up his whitegloved hands and walked away , letting the swedes enter i try not to bicker , he muttered , but this is getting too big a decadelong influx of foreign tourists visiting harlem churches has swelled considerably over the last year , to the point where harlem on a sunday morning has been transformed into something of an ecclesiastical theme park charter buses roll in by the dozens , lining the avenues tourists spill out by the thousands , pointing cameras at churchgoers like paparazzi swirling around celebrities at a movie premiere inside many of the churches , scores of white people in jeans and sweat shirts sit in secondstory balconies , separated from the black churchgoers in finely pressed suits and dresses on the main floor at some churches , there are more tourists than congregants most tourists say they come for cultural enrichment , and most congregants say they are honored by the interest that outsiders are taking in their houses , and styles , of worship but as the spiritual carnival grows more hectic , the more unsettling aspects of it come into bolder relief people do n't just go there for the religion , said patricia j williams , a black professor of law at columbia university who has published many essays on race relations they go for a show there s this sense of whites being on safari all that s missing is the hats in this country , there is a long history of white fascination with black worship , particularly in the south , professor williams said , recalling a civil warera picture she once saw of white people laying out picnics on a riverbank so they could watch black people baptize each other in the rushing waters below all around the world , she added , religious rituals are often seen by tourists as one of the most accessible and theatrical windows into a different culture but still , she said , the scene around harlem churches , which she visits sporadically , disturbs her , smacking of what she describes as a kind of racial voyeurism that would never happen in reverse with large groups of casually attired black visitors , say , dropping in on an upper west side synagogue on a friday night that unease is echoed by some congregants and even a pastor or two , although they seem uncomfortable discussing the phenomenon of so many tourists in their midst when i try to share my hymnal with a tourist , they wave it away , said a woman in her 70 s who refused to give her name , as she walked toward the entrance of abyssinian baptist , at 132 west 138th street to them , it s just a show i dislike all of this influx i wonder what s behind it one possible answer to her question came from marcus hardt , a german tourist standing in the line a few dozen yards away we do n't have many black people in germany , mr hardt said most pastors and congregants say they are inclined to a more generous interpretation of tourists' attention they say that christian churches , by their very mission , are havens of fellowship and good will that must open their doors wide to guests and not attribute impure motives to them they say they are proud for the world to see the positive images of black community , responsibility and righteousness that the churches of harlem project in addition , there is an evangelical bent to many of these conservative christian congregations and an accordant feeling that even if the tourists are coming for the music , maybe they will pick up the spirit along the way maybe you can do or say something that will bring them closer to god , said dr alvin t durant , the pastor of mother african methodist episcopal zion church on west 137th street , the congregation that accepts the overflow from abyssinian that s what my hope is but the churches' hospitality is not without more immediate rewards in a sort of implicit contract , many tour operators donate between 3 and 5 per tourist to some of the churches that welcome visitors by the busload that can easily mean tens of thousands of dollars in extra revenue each year for some congregations

during her unsuccessful race for state attorney general two years ago , karen s burstein was celebrated and supported by virtually every democratic official in manhattan but in the race she is now waging for a position of decidedly lower profile , nothing could be further from the case ms burstein is now running for surrogate in manhattan , which has two the surrogates head the court that handles cases involving wills , estates and adoptions in seeking the post , she is challenging an incumbent who is not only popular with democratic officials in manhattan but who also has been recommended by an independent judicial screening panel but ms burstein , too , is popular , particularly among the large liberal electorate in manhattan and that popularity poses a challenge to many of the very democratic leaders who championed her last campaign while the position of surrogate itself is a relatively obscure one among elective offices , the primary election in september for the posts will be a political test of the strength of the borough s democratic machine , which is rallying around ms burstein s opponent the incumbent is renee r roth , 56 , whose 14year term ends on dec 31 ms roth s supporters contend that her stewardship has been distinguished and that ms burstein s insurgent campaign reflects pure political opportunism and a desire to use the office as a stepping stone to some other elected position , specifically to someday succeed robert m morgenthau as manhattan district attorney normally , incumbents are n't challenged in these races , especially incumbents with outstanding records , ms roth said why is she doing this \? i have n't any idea it does n't make sense to me most people will tell you that i have an unblemished record , an outstanding record , in fact for her part , ms burstein , a former family court judge in brooklyn who is also a former executive director of the state consumer protection board , said her professional interests were more deeply rooted in the judiciary than in political offices and she dismisses as nonsense assertions that she is interested in higher office i do n't run for things that do n't interest me because they 're stepping stones to other things , she said every time i do something , it s because it s something i believe in ms burstein , who is 53 , added that many politicians have advised her against running for surrogate , suggesting that it is unwise to try to unseat an incumbent but i point out that i'm not trying to remove any judge , she said renee roth s term ends dec 31 she is not guaranteed unless this is the soviet union of being a judge on jan 1 she has to run for it two years ago , ms burstein achieved an upset victory in the statewide democratic primary for attorney general , defeating the incumbent , g oliver koppell but she narrowly lost in the general election to dennis c vacco , a republican , in a race that became highly charged ms burstein is a lesbian , and sexual orientation became an issue in that race despite mr vacco s pledge not to focus on it while she may have fared poorly upstate , ms burstein ran a campaign that made her something of a political celebrity in other regions , none more so than manhattan since then , she has taught law , opened a firm that focuses on litigation and undertaken a hectic schedule of speaking appearances but many democratic officials in manhattan said they felt bound to support ms roth because she was recommended by the new york independent judicial screening panel under the socalled panel system , there is a tacit agreement in the democratic party in manhattan to discourage candidates from running against incumbents found qualified by the panel , a situation intended to prevent party officials from becoming involved in the selection process the panel consists of representatives from a broad spectrum of the manhattan community , including bar associations , community groups , other civic organizations and law schools ms burstein said that while she endorses judicial reform , the panel should be open to consider any candidate who is qualified people complain that i am violating reform principles , she said the panel system is good and i support it but a panel that only one candidate can go to strikes me as something less than democratic the race has become a touchy issue within democratic party circles , particularly since ms burstein has been seen as one of the party s best prospects in future elections for other posts everyone has told karen not to do this because it will open up a pandora s box , said assemblyman herman d farrell jr , the manhattan democratic chairman the surrogate positions have traditionally been sources of patronage since they often involve appointing lawyers to fill guardianships , many of which are lucrative , and other roles in matters that come before the court there is a surrogate in each of the boroughs , except manhattan , which has two ms roth is widely credited with reducing patronage and insuring that women and black and hispanic lawyers have been assigned to handle cases it has become a complex race in which many of ms burstein s allies are scratching their heads trying to decide how to support ms roth while not alienating ms burstein it s interesting because i believe that karen burstein can win this , said antonio pagan , a city councilman from the lower east side of manhattan mr pagan endorsed ms roth earlier this year , when it was widely assumed that she would not be opposed in the democratic primary now , we have a whole different scenario and i'm not sure what i will do like everyone else , i'm waiting to see what happens photos renee r roth , the incumbent karen s burstein , thechallenger
in flushing , where an immigrant s chance to participate in the election process has often been more of a dream than a reality , the fact that four asians are on the ballot for the may 7 school board election is cause for celebration but for the korean community there , the euphoria has been marred by infighting among three candidates and their inability to come together to form a slate despite efforts by a chineseamerican candidate , pauline chu , an incumbent school board member seeking reelection , and john hong , chairman of the koreanamerican committee to elect school board members , to call a meeting to iron out their differences , the three candidates terence y park , kent park and jung kim have refused to join forces while all three say they desperately want to form a slate , each is accusing the others of sabotaging the plan people close to terence park and mr kim have accused mr hong s organization of supporting only kent park in the district , while pressuring their candidates to drop out and withholding from them 25 , 000 that has been raised for koreanamerican candidates mr hong denied that he specifically made targets of terence park and mr kim but he argued that the district s candidates should unite behind one of their number to provide the best chance for a koreanamerican to be elected in district 25 , only 1 , 500 koreanamericans are registered for the school board balloting , out of a total electorate of more than 50 , 000 in the district , 17 candidates are running for 9 board seats we are very happy that three koreans got on the ballot , mr hong said we want them to be elected but they have to have a plan otherwise there will be a lot of fighting and no one will get elected on the city s 32 local school boards , with a total of 288 seats , there are six asianamerican members and one of mixed asian and hispanic background because school board elections traditionally have low voter turnout , it is crucial for a candidate who does not have a solid voter base to get on as many slates as possible all three candidates have been active in the korean community , but none of the three has enough overall recognition to attract nonasian votes in order to win , all depend heavily on asian , particularly korean , votes so far , kent park has teamed with ms chu , a popular school board member who has a high profile both among asian and nonasian voters and has been a top votegetter in past elections she is the founder and president of the chineseamerican parents association mr kim and terence park say they have formed a slate and have allied themselves mostly with powerful nonasian candidates , a move that some say could hurt them the korean candidates , people who have been involved in the elections say , will provide their nonasian allies with korean votes , but are not likely to get much in return while all three say the infighting harms the image of the koreanamericans , they vowed to work out their differences before the election it bothers me that we do n't have fair representation yet and we are fighting like this , terence park said jane h lii photo terence y park is running against two other koreanamericans \( steve berman for the new york times \) chart district 25 4 in the running lists those on the ballot
zabdiel judah stands out at gleason s gym like mikhail baryshnikov at chippendale s while barrelchested pluggers hammer at the heavy bags , judah s deftly choreographed steps whisk him around the ring as he feints , ducks and jabs , never losing his focus or his balance at 19 , judah has a command of boxing artistry that many fighters never grasp judah s graceful performances have awed boxing pundits pernell whitaker , the sixtime world titleholder and now the world boxing council welterweight champion at 147 pounds , admitted , i ca n't teach him anything , because he already knows everything whitaker has known judah since the boy was 14 they have trained together at virginia beach , sparring , churning out situps , racing through the sand the 5foot7inch 140pound junior welterweight s style so closely mimics whitaker s that their sparring matches resembled shadow boxing yet whitaker is not the only expert lauding judah s professional prospects the promoter shelley finkel has termed judah s potential unlimited , and al mitchell , the united states olympic boxing coach , predicts , judah will be one of the future stars easy one caveat judah s next fight , on jan 7 , will be just his fourth professional bout while he has demolished his first three opponents , permitting none of them to last beyond the fourth round , he is not sugar ray leonard yet as whitaker said he s got the hand speed , quickness and agility of a world champion right now , he s climbing the ladder , racking up the wins but after a good fight , a hard fight , we 'll see if he s got the desire to go in and do it again that s when you judge judah s charisma and ease around people reflect well on the efforts of his father , yoel judah , who has raised seven sons almost singlehandedly in a fourbedroom house in the east flatbush section of brooklyn while five of zabdiel s brothers box , do not imagine that his home is wracked with violence it s a house full of warriors , yoel judah says of the family he guides with a stern but loving hand , everybody respects everybody there s no fighting , no hitting the judahs are israelites , and they frequently attend services on the jewish sabbath yet they have no objection to boxing on saturday , which zabdiel did on dec 14 , destroying jose torres \( 13 \) just 2 minutes 13 seconds into the fight he looked super , said whitaker , who was in atlantic city for the fight judah has trained with renewed purpose and vigor ever since last august s olympic trials , when he squandered the chance to fight for his country by losing in a boxoff to david diaz judah s bobandweave style rarely pleased amateur judges , but as the american boxers gathered for the trials , he nevertheless represented the greatest american hope for olympic boxing gold thus , questions remain concerning the obviously talented judah can he stay motivated \? can he stay healthy \? finally , can he take a punch \? so far , no credible power puncher has been able to land a solid shot to his chin for now , the plan calls for judah to fight every two or three weeks , while upgrading the caliber of his competition the promising junior welterweight was initially reluctant to challenge famous fighters by name , but when pressed he said , i hope chavez is still around i feel like i could do a number on him
washington , dec 5 the country first noticed william s cohen in july 1974 , when he announced that he would vote to recommend the impeachment of president richard m nixon by acts or acquiescence , the freshman house republican declared , president nixon allowed the rule of law and the constitution to slip under the boot of indifference and arrogance and abuse the path that took the thenyoung maine congressman to his selection today as secretary of defense led through 18 years in the senate , where he built his reputation as a serious student of defense , intelligence gathering and government ethics in the senate , he has argued for many years that presidents are obliged to get congressional consent before committing united states troops abroad in 1991 , before voting to support an invasion of iraq , he told the senate there is no doubt in my mind that congress has the sole power to declare , and the president has the sole power to execute , wars with immediate praise from the senate s republican leader , trent lott of mississippi , who called mr cohen one of the smartest members of the senate , there seems no doubt that he will be easily confirmed when he is , he will fill a post that some democratic presidents used in the past to signal bipartisanship republicans robert s mcnamara and robert a lovett headed the defense department under presidents john f kennedy and harry truman , and franklin d roosevelt had henry l stimson at the war department and frank knox at navy before the defense department was created senator john w warner , republican of virginia , like the secretary designate a veteran member of the armed services committee , predicted that mr cohen will go a long way to insulate the president from the continuing complaints about the foreign policy mistakes of this administration he predicted far greater consultation between the president and congress on issues of foreign policy , particularly when the president intends to employ troops abroad though sensitive to the need for the ships produced by maine s bath iron works , mr cohen has also been skeptical about some areas of military spending , notably the b2 bomber a friend , senator john mccain , republican of arizona , said today , he has the intellectual grasp of the geopolitical issues that i think will allow the administration to move forward on the reshaping of the military that we 've done very little of while he was among a dwindling band of republican moderates and often voted against his party on social issues like abortion , he was generally well liked in both parties today mr cohen echoed both his own history and the role mr clinton has chosen for him when he told a white house news conference i think there is legitimate debate over specific spending within our national security apparatus , but our policy at all costs must be unified when it comes down to those crucial moments when the nation is in need he said , my entire congressional career has been devoted to pursuing a national security policy that is without partisanship the 56yearold senator did not run for a fourth term this year , giving several reasons , including dismay and frustration over stalemate and a breakdown in civil debate and discourse in government and in october , newly remarried , to janet langhart , a television commentator , he said he was hoping to make money and to write a thriller , open ties with a law firm , become a television personality himself and create a defense and intelligence consulting operation he was busy leasing office space and getting business cards printed and then the president called , he said tonight , and told him when they met that he wanted to establish a bipartisan foreign policy so instead of a calmer , more varied life , mr cohen will take on one of the two or three most demanding jobs in the government , one that he acknowledged compels long hours , and a great deal of traveling i 've had to put my own plans on hold for a few years in congress , mr cohen has been seen as something of a loner but that was in part a result of his insistence on finding a variety of ways to spend his time , including writing books and poetry and traveling mr mccain said , he s a man whose interests were both in the senate and outside it he often displays a quizzical smile , and people who have worked for him say he never raises his voice william sebastian cohen was born in bangor , me , on aug 28 , 1940 , the son of reuben and clara cohen his father was a baker a unitarian , mr cohen graduated from bangor high school in 1958 , bowdoin college in 1962 , and the boston university law school in 1965 he married and had two children , kevin and christopher , before graduating and did not serve in the armed forces he was elected to the city council of bangor from 1969 to 1972 , while practicing law , and was mayor in 1971 and 1972 , when he was first elected to the house he served three terms , and then defeated senator william hathaway , a democrat , in 1978 he wrote a journal , roll call , one year in the united states senate recounting the high , the low and the dull moments of a freshman senator s life he has also published several novels about washington but none , he said in an interview tonight , feature a secretary of defense in succeeding years he played an important role in legislation reorganizing the offices of the joint chiefs of staff and in setting up a separate command for special forces he also said he felt he had succeeded in some efforts to save money in defense spending through improved procurement and management of information technology he has been prominent in efforts to regulate lobbying and gifts to members of congress , which were passed , and to overhaul campaign spending , which have failed and at the end of the bush administration , when legislation providing for the appointment of independent counsels was about to expire , he warned his republican colleagues to keep the law in force , telling them that someday they would want a democratic administration to be subjected to such probes now he is joining one small sampling of poetry by man picked for defense from a

a spiffy new curriculum imported from a university \? a renovation of the school building \? in fact , the solution common to all 10 schools was far simpler , although it is rarely practiced in failing schools it was an allout focus on what is taught in the classroom at new york prep , a middle school in east harlem where fewer than a quarter of students were at grade level in mathematics , the principal established a math laboratory to give students in small groups three periods a week of enrichment to supplement their regular course work at public school 181 in springfield gardens , queens , the teachers began using a computer to design buildingwide standardized tests to pinpoint , monthly , what students were learning and how well teachers were teaching at public school 314 in bay ridge , brooklyn , the new principal found that students were being taught from no fewer than five series of reading textbooks none of which related to one another as they moved from grade to grade one method was ultimately selected it s learning , stupid , said noreen connell , executive director of the educational priorities panel , boiling down to a phrase the findings of her organization s study , which was released yesterday it s sort of embarrassing to say that it took us so long to figure out what was so obvious in the end the state established its list of failing schools in 1989 to monitor schools where few students were achieving minimum competency in math or reading and where test scores were steadily declining since then , few schools have been able to shed that designation of the 102 schools in new york city that were placed on the list from 1989 through 1996 , 24 have improved enough to come off the list to provide a map to those still struggling , the educational priorities panel , a coalition of 26 civic and parents' groups , examined 10 schools that were removed from the list last year , 6 elementary schools , 2 middle schools and 2 high schools the study found that replacing the principal a remedy that schools chancellor rudy crew has advocated for failing schools was no guarantee of success in five schools , new principals who were installed after the schools had been placed on the list had to be replaced , after having failed to turn around the schools in two other schools , the principals who presided over the schools' removal from the list were the same ones who had been in place when the schools were added to the list in three cases , the panel found , the story of school improvement conformed to the hollywood scenario of a 'take charge' principal transforming a dismal school the panel also found no strong correlation between a school s improvement and the degree of new money pumped into it , the model it adopted to improve staff development or even the degree to which its building was cleaned up instead , the panel determined that the performance ultimately rose or fell on the degree to which the principal , the teachers , administrators and parents , working together on designated planning teams , shared a unified approach to how students should be taught all schools worked to coordinate what each teacher was teaching , so that what was learned in one grade was built on , and not abandoned , in the next all began to use data to monitor students' performance each made a concerted effort to involve parents in their students' work , as well as in the daytoday operation of the building and all benefited from the departure of much of the teaching staff , either through attrition or , in some cases , persuasion by the end of this study , the report said , we could see that there was one startingly common pattern among all 10 schools these principals and staff members had given their primary attention to solving the problem of low student achievement all other strategies emerged from this central focus at new york prep , which was added to the list in 1991 and taken off four years later , the school day was extended 25 minutes from mondays through thursdays to let teachers to dismiss students early on fridays , and thus meet as a group the teachers also monitor performance doggedly , calling parents at home when a single homework assignment is missed or an absence is recorded sarah mundo said the test scores of her son nestor parrilla , 13 , had risen to b s , from c s and d s , in the two months that he had spent in the seventh grade at the school they do n't let him get away with anything , she said of her son s teachers it shook him up a lot photo robert nadel , director of new york prep in east harlem , greeting ninth graders who were returning from lunch the school established a math lab to give small groups three periods a week of enrichment work \( ruby washington the new york times \)
mesa , ariz , oct 25 during a break in their aerobics class at a local gymnasium , elderly people here complained this week that neither president clinton nor bob dole had seriously addressed the financial problems that face medicare , the health insurance program they adore ideally , they said in interviews , no changes should be made in medicare but they were also realistic we probably will have a higher premium , said chrystabel i mccaig , 75 , who has had three heart attacks , two angioplasty procedures and openheart surgery and who now spends two hours a day at the gym if we have to pay it , we 'll have to pay it nearby , at the mesa senior center , a gathering place for retirees , betty l ritchie , 77 , deplored mudslinging by the candidates i 've been waiting for them to come forth with a plan that would start saving our medicare , mrs ritchie said but they have n't come through , have they \? medicare has always been a volatile political issue , but in the last two years , it has become more contentious than ever president clinton has cited his approach toward medicare as a symbol of his differences with republicans he has said that republican proposals to overhaul the program would dismantle medicare as we know it republicans have said their ideas would save it in recent weeks , mr clinton and mr dole have accused each other of lying about medicare and exploiting the issue but here in arizona , people say that they are tired of such brickbats , that they see a serious problem and want it solved dr robert j dunn , the president of the arizona medical association , said he wished the candidates would talk about the issues , especially the future of medicare we hear that it s going broke , and my patients ask me what s going to happen , said dr dunn , a neurosurgeon but none of the candidates really addresses the issue or says how they will decrease the growth of medicare it s like an unwanted guest at a banquet the candidates are afraid to say anything that would cost them the election such impatience is often heard in this state , which has had a long , generally favorable experience with health maintenance organizations and other forms of managed health care , an approach both political parties promote as a way to help control medicare spending nonpartisan experts , like the congressional budget office , see a looming crisis in medicare on that issue , at least , arizonans are several years ahead of congress sara l wever , a local coordinator for the american association of retired persons , which has 530 , 000 members in arizona , said , most aarp members here realize that changes need to be made in medicare to control costs , and they 'd rather have them sooner rather than later , so the changes do n't have to be too drastic in the last decade , when medicare enrollment was growing slowly , medicare spending grew an average of 10 percent a year , to 177 billion in 1995 in each of the last two years , the medicare hospital insurance trust fund , which pays hospital bills , spent more than it received in payroll taxes and other income , and officials say that with no change , the fund will be depleted in 2001 , a decade before baby boomers become eligible for benefits and place immense new demands on it the longrange outlook for the fund is extremely unfavorable , the trustees said in june in addition , the aging of the population will sharply increase pressures on the federal budget for social security and medicaid as well as for medicare so it is virtually certain that the next congress will have to make major changes in medicare , like increasing costs for some beneficiaries , limiting benefits and further curbing payments to doctors and hospitals but the campaigns this year , rather than forging any consensus , have made the task much more difficult mr clinton has forsworn changes that would increase costs for beneficiaries , suggesting that all the savings have to be extracted from doctors , hospitals and other health care providers republicans , having been denounced by democrats as ogres out to destroy medicare , say they will be content to let democrats take the lead in proposing politically unpopular measures to alter the program next year one way to slow the growth in costs , experts say , is to place more people in hmo s , which offer to provide all care for set fees but restrict the choice of doctors and closely monitor treatment decisions in that respect , arizona offers a preview of the future nationally , about 10 percent of the 38 million medicare beneficiaries are in hmo s but in arizona , 33 percent of the 613 , 000 medicare recipients are in health maintenance organizations , and they benefit from fierce competition among health plans vying for their business with so many medicare hmo s in arizona , it can be difficult to know which health plan to select , says a brochure from the intergroup hmo , a subsidiary of the foundation health corporation of rancho cordova , calif intergroup attracts the elderly with benefits not covered by the standard medicare program coverage for prescription drugs , free transportation to and from doctors' offices and free membership in affiliated health clubs
teheran , iran with inflation raging around 50 percent , the capital choked by air pollution , the prodigious carpetweaving industry in the doldrums , and the government infested with embezzlement scandals , one of the most vociferous debates gripping iran is whether women should be permitted to ride bicycles a few women are struggling to retain the right to bicycle through a large teheran park , but most of them gave up when fresh restrictions limited them to one fivemile trail now secluded behind a pineboard fence and monitored by the police col agha , a satirical weekly , weighed in with a letter from a male reader patenting the perfect compromise limiting his wife s riding to a stationary bicycle in the kitchen some conservative religious scholars declared that , since bicycle seats resemble saddles , and they believe that muslim women should not ride horseback , then bicycling should be prohibited the country s spiritual leader , ayatollah ali khamenei , made his pronouncement in the september edition of sobh , the voice of religious orthodoxy women must avoid anything that attracts strangers , so riding bicycles or motorcycles by women in public places involves corruption and is forbidden this is a time of vehement intolerance in iran , a backlash against the incremental loosening of clerical control over the last few years in the arenas of politics , education , the arts and social activities today , castigation comes not only through official channels but also in the form of freelance attacks by the partisans of the party of god , shock troops devoted to the most puritanical government factions the atmosphere is inescapable a new television program singles out specific writers and professors as israeli spies or social misfits the university system is being purged of unislamic elements whose loyalty to the revolution is deemed insufficient professors who are considered dissenters have been beaten publications are being shuttered , and the outdoor social season provoked a frenzy of raids on private celebrations there is deep fear and absolutely no freedom of expression almost everyone has been silenced , said an editor whose journal was shut down and who now writes screenplays under a pseudonym few iranian intellectuals want to be quoted by name anymore because remarks that reached the outside world have been distorted in the local witch hunt these thrusts and parries have always punctuated the endless power struggle between the more inflexible and more tolerant branches of iran s ruling clergy , but the latest exchanges have been more frantic the language of intimidation first , ideological wars tend to crop up when the government seeks to distract attention from deepening economic problems second , the conservatives lost about a 90seat chunk of the 270seat parliament in elections last spring and want to regain the initiative before next summer s presidential vote the constitution bars president hashemi rafsanjani from seeking a third term conservatives amplify issues like bike riding because they fear the country is not paying proper homage to the religious inspiration that was at the root of the iranian revolution the iranian revolution still needs time to reach a balance , said ayatollah muhajarani , a legal adviser to mr rafsanjani we need time for the various factions to achieve a logical dialogue with each other the most recent exchanges have been conducted in the language of intimidation and the most ferocious attacks focused on dr abdolkarim soroush , a popular philosophy professor who alarmed the government by arguing that greater separation of mosque and state might strengthen iranian democracy he was mugged twice while lecturing last year and took eight months off the lecture circuit this spring his lectures in teheran were canceled because of demonstrations by the partisans of the party of god , a group of devout veterans , most from poor families , who have staged at least 15 protests or mass prayers in the year since their emergence they gather at universities , movie theaters or on wealthy streets to denounce things like loosely veiled women and rap music in an open letter to the government , dr soroush said he felt he was in mortal danger , especially since official denunciations made him seem an acceptable target as a professor , how can i tell my students to be brave and to think freely and how can i talk to them about the opportunities in this society when i see that all these things are a sin in this community \? he wrote in kiyan magazine the same issue contained a letter from five western islamic specialists calling for protection for dr soroush and other intellectuals the government responded in august by accusing the kiyan editor in court of weakening the foundation of the islamic republic , a vague charge that carries a punishment of up to 80 lashes and five years in prison so far this year one daily , two weeklies and a monthly have been closed of 10 quarterlies that used to engender the liveliest discussions of politics and culture , three remain

belfast , northern ireland , may 30 elective politics in northern ireland has always been strictly a man s game but now an energetic new women s movement is running in an election here , saying it would bring nonpartisan , nonsectarian voices to the negotiating table this british province voted today to select negotiators for peace talks that are scheduled to start on june 10 in a threeweek campaign , the northern ireland women s coalition argued that the male politicians , strutting and fretting and boycotting and walking out in a huff , had botched all previous negotiations the votes will be counted and results announced on friday because women have never posed such a challenge to male power , it is difficult to predict the outcome of the women s campaign the maledominated parties are fielding only a few female candidates , with no more than a dozen given a chance to win so the male politicians are worried and most officials and analysts feel that the coalition women , who come from liberal and conservative , protestant and catholic backgrounds , have a chance to win places at the june talks acknowledging that many northern ireland women have not bothered to vote in previous elections , pearl sager , a social worker who is a coalition candidate , said i would have been one of those , i would n't have dreamt of voting women in general are often unsure of themselves , they tend to take on the politics of their husband or their father , because they 're not sure or confident , but there s no reason why they should n't be another candidate , avila kilmurray , said people ask us what new thing we can bring our answer is that we 're not going to bring anything new in terms of constitutional politics , because all those views can and should be represented at the table we 're looking to try and facilitate solutions or actions rather than a point of view we 're asking whether there are other ways of helping the process forward for the 76 years of northern ireland s existence as a province of britain , politics in ulster , where women are 52 percent of the population , has been dominated by men of the protestant majority and the roman catholic minority of the province s 17 members of the british parliament , none are women of the 3 members of the european parliament in strasbourg , france , none are women only 12 percent of the seats in local councils are held by women normally , women have left elective politics to men , engaging in volunteer community work two northern ireland women , mairead corrigan and betty williams , were awarded the nobel peace prize 20 years ago , but the influence of their group , peace people , has dwindled but in the special election held today in the province , the northern ireland women s coalition presented 68 candidates for the 110 seats in a new forum from which negotiators for the june talks will be chosen , by party leaders of the 23 parties running in the election with 900 candidates , the 10 parties receiving the most votes will be assured seats at the june negotiations all delegations to the negotiations will be the same size , so the election today was largely a way to seek a mandate for party positions in the negotiations all the major parties are certain to gain enough votes today to qualify for seats at the negotiations but sinn fein , the political wing of the irish republican army , will be excluded from the talks unless the ira restores the 17month ceasefire it ended on feb 9 with a series of bomb attacks in london if sinn fein is eventually admitted , the talks will mark the first time that all parties involved in the northern peace effort , plus the british and irish governments , will face each other across a table to seek an end of the intermittent guerrilla violence that has killed more than 3 , 100 since 1969 without sinn fein , the talks could proceed , but could not produce the permanent settlement , including the end of ira violence , that is their goal in the election campaign , the women s coalition has avoided the partisan sectarian debate that has divided the maledominated major parties , sinn fein and the social democratic and labor party , both predominantly catholic , and the predominantly protestant parties , the ulster unionists and the democratic unionists the coalition women have been encouraged by the presence and support , direct and indirect , of women already prominent in the peace effort president mary robinson of the irish republic the american and british ambassadors to dublin , jean kennedy smith and veronica sutherland , and the energetic and ubiquitous american consul general in belfast , kathleen stephens maybe it will begin a ground swell of popular desire for change , said ms stephens , who has met with coalition candidates the implications go beyond women s issues because in the negotiations the coalition would be addressing the disconnection between the very insular world of politicians and the lives of everyone in the community the male politicians are wary , if not hostile the coalition women were stung by the statement by peter robinson , the protestant deputy leader of the hardline democratic unionist party , that he never noticed any of the group s candidates standing by their men during the sectarian killing some experts say the women will siphon votes away from liberally oriented parties like the predominantly catholic social democratic and labor party and the alliance party , a 6040 mix of protestants and catholics a leading catholic politician said they have no program , no positions they just like to sit around and talk to each other ms sagar would disagree referring to the boycotts and walkouts of male politicians that caused past negotiations to collapse , she said we have to learn to negotiate with one another you just ca n't get up and act childish and leave the room if somebody says something you do n't like this is the time to do it , because if it does n't work this time we do n't know what s going to happen
mexico city , july 24 an international human rights delegation here this week heard new testimony from a witness who said he saw mexican soldiers in a rural church in chiapas state torture three young farm boys who later were found dead along a highway in mexico city , a stream of citizens told the delegation about police officers' using torture while carrying out criminal investigations and in the turbulent state of guerrero , the delegation from the organization of american states got a taste of the harrassment that human rights monitors endure routinely in many parts of mexico before meeting with witnesses to killings and other abuses by the police , the commissioners had to clear their meeting room of plainclothes agents sent by the state government mexico has for decades rejected international criticism of its human rights record as interference in its sovereign affairs until the 10day trip that ended today , mexico was the only large latin american nation that had kept out the organization s human rights commission mexico has been one of the countries that has been most aggressive on the issue of not accepting any kind of outside scrutiny , said jose miguel vivanco , executive director of human rights watch americas but since the north american free trade agreement took effect in 1994 , mexico has had to open its society to outside scrutiny on many fronts this visit marks a clear evolution , a new openness , mr vivanco said a mexican official who spoke on condition of anonymity said that there was a lengthy debate within the government over whether to invite the oas delegation finally , we felt we did n't have anything to hide , the official said although there may be abuses in mexico , our policy is to foster respect for human rights throughout the trip , delegation members repeatedly thanked president ernesto zedillo for allowing them into mexico , even as their mere presence focused a attention on the violence that is endemic in many parts of mexico in a news conference today , claudio grossman , the commission s chileanborn president , read a statement noting that the commission had observed the existence of great mistrust toward the police and received complaints about their inefficiency , corruption , arbitrary arrests and torture mr grossman also criticized the judicial system for inefficiency and bias , and lamented that none of mexico s most notorious political killings have been solved the commission split into two groups to visit the especiallytroubled states of chiapas and guerrero in chiapas , they heard testimony from a man who said he watched inside a church in the hamlet of morelia in january 1994 as soldiers bludgeoned three peasant men with the butts of their rifles , occasionally dunking their bloodied heads in a tub of water the victims were driven away in an army truck and were found dead a month later a military tribunal absolved the army of responsibility in guerrero , the commissioners met with the widows and mothers of 17 men gunned down at a police checkpoint on june 28 , 1995 although the supreme court earlier this year concluded that guerrero s former governor , ruben figueroa , an influential figure in mexico s ruling party , had orchestrated the massacre , he remains free several of the widows and mothers told the commissioners that the guerrero government had made modest reparation payments , which some had interpreted as an attempt to silence them others said they have received nothing

for all of its smooth , sometimes overheated craftsmanship , ronald harwood s taking sides , now at the brooks atkinson theater , accomplishes a feat not often witnessed in our commercial theater it simultaneously illuminates the complex character of a great artist and preserves the integral mysteriousness of his mind the philistines do n't come off well here , but neither does the artist he is wilhelm furtwangler \( 18861954 \) , the celebrated german conductor who chose to remain in nazi germany when his jewish colleagues were forced to leave or face deportation to the camps , and when many of his nonjewish colleagues went into voluntary exile in protest as there were no easy answers during his life , there are none in taking sides , which examines furtwangler s motives as they are revealed during preparations for his appearance before the denazification tribunal in 1946 the setting is occupied berlin , the office of united states army maj steve arnold \( ed harris \) , a quickthinking , boorish man , an insurance assessor in civilian life , whose selfproclaimed mission is to nail the bandleader , meaning furtwangler \( daniel massey \) as a collaborator in putting together the brief that the americans will present to the commission , the major exhibits zeal but little wit he s a blunt instrument there s always one question the guilty ca n't answer , the major says early on his intention to find the question though the major is played with riveting , pumpedup energy by mr harris , he is less a character than a function of the plot his motives for wanting to humiliate furtwangler , using blackmail and bribes if he must , seem bogus in view of his insensitivity in all other matters there are four supporting characters in the play , but taking sides has the form of a duel between furtwangler and the major , who is such an oversimplification that you might expect the fight to be nocontest that it is a contest , and that the play leaves you with something more than a playbill to carry home , is a credit to mr harwood s writing of the furtwangler character and to mr massey s superlative performance in the role the contest turns out to be less between the major and the conductor than between the conductor and himself mr harwood so constructs taking sides \( a production of which was presented in london last year \) that furtwangler has come to dominate the stage even before mr massey makes his entrance the facts are laid out though furtwangler continued to work in nazi germany and was , indeed , hitler s favorite conductor , he never joined the nazi party he was public in his outrage at the treatment of jewish composers and musicians , would not conduct at official state ceremonies , and , on one occasion that became noteworthy , refused to give the nazi salute to hitler when furtwangler finally appears halfway through the first act , a tall , almost bald , hulking but rather dainty man , he has the reserved manner of one of nature s born aristocrats he is unsurprised by the major s rudeness and speaks only when a question is directed to him he says he did n't leave germany because that would have been a victory for them his duty , he says , was to stay , to keep alive the true spirit of german culture as the play proceeds , we recognize that furtwangler was never an especially warm man , but then he never masqueraded as one the major suggests that he made a pact with the devil in return for a plush life and the acclaim that only the regime could guarantee him furtwangler is genuinely shocked art and politics need not intersect he is eloquent on the subject of herbert von karajan , another conductor who stayed in germany , was lionized , joined the nazi party \( twice \) and was denazified with seeming ease the major suggests that furtwangler pulled strings to have a powerful music critic , who preferred karajan , sent off to the russian front furtwangler finds that idea absurd dark clouds on the horizon his passion begins to show as any idiot should know , he objects to karajan because he is an intellectual conductor his distaste is specific the slow tempi are too slow , the fast ones too fast the whole effect is somewhat hysterical he ca n't bear to speak karajan s name when necessary , he refers to him as k behind all this talk of german culture , german spirit and art , there is a dangerous kind of selfserving elitism evidence is presented to the effect that furtwangler was instrumental in the escape of a number of jewish musicians yet in the one case we hear about , he had the young man , a pianist , play three minutes of the beethoven waldstein sonata before agreeing to help what would have happened if the fellow had been a secondrater \? for that matter , did furtwangler s obsession with his art really put him at such a far remove from the world around him \? could such a sophisticated man be so naive \? in addition to the performances by mr massey and mr harris , the production is well served by david jones s direction , david jenkins s unit set , which encases the major s barren office in what looks to be the shroud of bombedout berlin , and by the supporting cast elizabeth marvel , michael stuhlbarg , norbert weisser and ann dowd
for sherrie walters , a junior at mount vernon high school , the off the street program , a mentoring program based at two city elementary schools , gives her a chance to help some needy children , earn a few dollars and experience a special kind of personal fulfillment sherrie is one of 16 mount vernon high school students who once or twice a week , since last september , has worked with youngsters on their social , academic and concentration skills the program is run under the auspices of westchester jewish community services and financed by invest in kids , a westchester urban youth initiative the program was begun last summer with the selection and training of the mentors youngsters are chosen for the program based on recommendations from guidance counselors , social workers and members of the school staff who have identified them as being lonely , socially awkward or in need of a role model or a friend here are excerpts from a recent conversation with sherrie q what interested you about this program \? a working with kids i like to work with kids , and i like to see them happy there are two different days that the program runs on tuesday at parker school and on thursday at columbus elementary school and i do both days the program runs from 3 15 until 5 45 we help them with homework we talk with them , we play with them some of the young children are there because for the longest time , all their lives , they are getting pushed on or whatever everybody tells them what to do so this is their chance to do what they want to do it s really fun for them most of the time nobody wants to leave you go there , and they hand you this and tell you about this , and you show them things and help them out and see the smile on their faces when they accomplish something it really makes me feel good q what do you do with the children you work with \? a everybody works with one child each day , so you build a relationship i work with sasha on tuesday and richard on thursday mostly , we try to build their social skills , their concentration skills we work really hard on that because most of the time that is what they are really lacking they are really smart kids but there are certain areas that need to be built up , so we play games with them we play concentration , pictionary , chess , checkers , games that help them concentrate other times we all come together in a circle , and everyone tells how their day went , what was good , what was bad , what they accomplished that really helps them to talk about their feelings and there have been drastic changes since the program started in september everyone s grades went up we got progress reports from their teachers , and their social skills went up and their concentration went up q why do you think that happened \? just having a relationship with someone who believed in them \? a i do n't think they really know they 're building up skills i think it s having the relationship with someone who gives you positive input who keeps saying keep trying i know you can do it they feel really good about themselves q you mentor a boy and a girl are there differences in how you deal with them \? a yes , because their needs are different with sasha i really need to work on her concentration skills she will start something and see what someone else is doing and just get up and want to do that so what she thought about one day is that she wanted to build a house in the gym there are tumbling mats , and we made a house out of that and we sat there and we played all these games and did our homework , and she really liked this it kind of helped her concentrate richard is extremely bright for his age when i first got there , he had gone through all the other mentors he likes to be kind of dominating he likes to be the captain , the one running the show when i work with him thursdays , i make sure i ask him , how did your day go \? what happened today \? and what do you want to do \? first thing is , everything is boring , he does n't want to do anything but you then have to say , we can play this , but you can make your own rules we can change all the rules to make the game fun then you can work with him we try to cater to his needs , but at the same time he has to meet us half way q what is in this for you \? a i get meaningful experience working with others i think i 'd like to , when i go to college , major in a profession that deals with working with others , especially children maybe a teacher or a pediatrician q you 're getting paid as well , correct \? a yes , 560 an hour five hours a week q what training were you given for this program \? a over the summer , after we were told we were selected , they had training sessions we were put through scenarios by our supervisor , sara bennett this is what could happen this is what we do n't want to happen , this is what you might have to deal with q how do your peers react to this \? is it something that your peers admire you for doing \? a this year we 're trying to extend the program , and i tell others about it and they seem receptive and say they 'd like to do it , too i really try to get the people who i think really want to help these kids , who really want to work with children q does it surprise you sometimes how needy some of these children are \? a not really you know you 've been there yourself q have you been there yourself \? a in some ways , yes being there are five of children in my family and everybody wants attention and when you see someone else getting something , you want it , too and if you do n't get it you feel hurt q so there are some common elements to all children growing up \? a i think everybody goes through this q what is your most frustrating thing , if anything \? a when you have a bad day at school yourself and you go in and the child does n't want to work with you and they 're really having a fit they do n't want to talk to you that really is frustrating q how do you overcome that \? a we start by asking , what s the problem \? what can we do together to solve that \? what do you want to do \? do you want to talk about it \? and if none of that works , you run to sara bennett for help she s there all the time to help us it s amazing the things that she can do to get a situation under control she s really good q is there one very special moment in the program that stands out for you \? a when i first started going on thursdays with richard at first everyone was saying he is really difficult and that i 'd have to give up like the rest of them did it took me about three weeks , and i talked to him it seems like every minute someone is coming into his life and leaving him and so finally by the third or fourth week we sat down there and talked about how his day went and put together a puzzle and just had fun it was like wow ! q what happens to a child like richard , who you said is used to being abandoned , when the program ends and you 're gone \? a what we 're trying to do is continue with relationships outside of the program that goes on during the program as well there are times when you go out to the park , or something or his family gets together with mine i do n't think we should just break contact q is there a message to adults reading this \? a do n't give up on these kids you have to really work with them that s why there are problems now because people have given up on them photo sherrie walters , right , with sasha , a student in the mountvernon mentoring program \( susan harris for the new york times \)
the secretive federal reserve , for decades the arbiter of monetary policy and regulator of banks , has recently undertaken a new and very public sideline developing sites on the world wide web the fed s web sites are home to some of the government s best online economic data and analysis unfortunately , as with much of the internet , the trick for potential users of the fed sites is first to realize that useful information exists , then hunt through the clutter to find it the fed s organizational structure does not help each of the fed s 12 district banks is responsible for setting up its own home page , and there is no standard format a particular statistic or study available from one bank s site may not exist on its sister sites and even if it does , it is quite possibly filed under a different section the up side of this individualism is the range of features and information available at these sites each fed district has its own economists doing their own research , and much of it is narrowly targeted to issues in its particular region for instance , the san francisco fed offers opinions on employment in silicon valley s computer industry meanwhile , the philadelphia bank s research department surveys that region s manufacturing industries the fed s wellknown beige book , which analyzes the overall economic prospects of each of the 12 districts , is now available at the minneapolis fed s web site besides regional economic data , there is also a host of national information available the new york fed generates its own estimates of foreign exchange rates and posts them on the web twice daily other information , like recent commercial paper rates , is also on line one sign that the fed has yet to become truly webfriendly some of the most upto date interest rates , including commercial paper rates , are available on a telephone recording within a day of being set that data at times do not make it to the web for up to a week the st louis fed has one of the snappiest of the fed s home pages its site houses fred , or federal reserve economic data , a data base that offers a mix of information as diverse as consumer credit and the money supply major fed studies are supposed to be posted on fred within hours of release one of fred s new features , ftp mail , allows users looking for data to have it emailed directly to them instead of taking the time to pull it off the web every time it is updated this feature can be a time saver for users who want to download data regularly chief financial officers , for example , who want the threemonth commercial paper rate every week except for the richmond district , all the fed banks now have sites , as does the fed s board of governors in washington all the sites are linked , so it is easy to skip among them while the scope of the fed s economic data is not nearly as comprehensive as some other federal sites especially the commerce department s stat usa site it does offer access to the central bank s unusual research strengths and unlike the bigger commerce site , which charges a 50 annual subscriber fee , none of the 12 fed sites cost users a penny chart where to go http www ny frb org new york federal reserve district bank of new york http woodrowmplsfrbfedus minneapolis federal reserve district bank of minneapolis http www frbsf org san francisco federal reserve district bank of st louis http www statusa gov statusa stat usa , from the us department of commerce http www bog frb fed us federal reserve board of governors
april was not very kind to jason isringhausen the young righthander entered the second game of wednesday night s doubleheader against the montreal expos with a 12 record and a 485 earned run average wednesday , though , was the first day of may new month new life the mets backed their starter with four firstinning runs and another in the second isringhausen responded with blank after blank against the best hitting club in the major leagues it was a performance reminiscent of isringhausen s rookie season , when he won his last seven decisions on his way to a 92 record as isringhausen put it , after eight scoreless innings in a 60 blanking of the expos earned the mets a split that s the way i feel i should pitch every night i have high standards , and i have n't been pitching that well lately none of the mets' young arms had until recently isringhausen s performance enabled the new yorkers to take two out of three from the firstplace expos at shea stadium the mets , who will play 16 of their next 19 games away from home , have won 4 of their last 5 games and 8 of their last 12 to pull to within five games of montreal and if they are to have any chance at postseason play especially without the injured pitcher bill pulsipher the hardthrowing 23yearold isringhausen is going to have to shoulder a big share of the load if wednesday night was any indication , the mets should be more confident i think it was closer to what we expect out of him every time out , manager dallas green said the times he has struggled , and he s struggled two or three times , have been when he has n't had the breaking ball and the changeup over he s got to get one of the two offspeed pitches over the plate to be successful he just cannot stand there and challenge guys night after night , inning after inning , game after game it just does n't work that way he s worked very hard to get his breaking ball going for himself and he s worked real hard to get the changeup going both were working , albeit sporadically , by the end of the game it was more than enough , as the expos managed four measly singles i may not have great control of them , but as long as you show it to them , they have it in the back of their head that it s still there , isringhausen said of his secondary pitches in a sense , isringhausen was playing the role of stopper hours earlier , the mets had barely managed two singles of their own off pedro martinez in a 40 firstgame loss and here was isringhausen , facing a lineup that leads the national league in every major offensive category the way isringhausen shut montreal down makes one wonder if there is a lineup out there he cannot dominate when he has all of his pitches going green , for one , does not think there is i would be surprised if he did n't dominate , green said he froze some guys with that breaking ball and he got some real big outs with the changeup what it does is make the fastball just that much faster they ca n't catch up with it , they pop it up instead of just sitting there waiting for the fastball , they 've got a couple other pitches to worry about that puts doubt in a hitter s mind and that s what pitching is all about how much doubt was in isringhausen s mind as he struggled throughout april \? i was n't worried , he insisted i was only 12 it was n't like i was 04 or something yeah , it s in the back of your head all the time but it was nothing to panic about last year , i came up here , i was on top of my game i had 100 innings in already there could not have been too many of them as satisfying as the eight he pitched on wednesday night

tucson , ariz , jan 13 usually , professional golf is the most genteel and civil of sports , a refined joust conducted in near silence punctuated by applause and occasional loud cheers but take the pga tour out to the wild , wild west , and some downright disorderly things can happen like today , during the third round of the nortel open at tucson national , when keith fergus and his caddie , artie granfield , were attacked by a swarm of bees while on the practice range , sending the two of them running down the first fairway , flailing wildly i got stung 10 or 20 times , said fergus , who had just finished shooting 67 artie got it worse granfield jumped into a lake to escape neither was seriously hurt in an unrelated display of frontier justice , the greenkeeper at starr pass the other golf course on which the field competed during the first two rounds was fired by the club the terse explanation was that rob sample , the superintendent , had not brought the greens up to snuff for the competition an unknown gunslinger named david toms continued to mow down the established stars in the 125 million tournament toms , who shot 69 , stands at 11 under par , one stroke better than ronnie black and two strokes better than the local hero , phil mickelson , and joel edwards edwards , who was tied for the lead at the final hole , fourputted the green for double bogey , shooting himself in the foot by twice missing from three feet dare we say it \? a sunday shootout looms here in the land of the saguaro if mickelson starts making a few putts , he will be difficult to hold off he is striking the ball as well as he has since , well , since he won here last year and there is a whole cluster of good players at eight under par , just three strokes behind looming lee janzen , who stormed into contention with a round of 66 fred funk , who moved into range with a 68 bruce lietzke , off vacation and on tour , who shot 68 and bob lohr , whose 66 put him right into the crowd bob estes would have been right there , too , but he doublebogeyed the last hole with 10 players within three strokes of the lead , anything at all can happen toms , third on the nike tour last year , is swinging well he was a veteran of three seasons when he failed to keep his card , and now seems to have learned what it takes in 1994 , i learned that you ca n't think about winning , that you ca n't think about the money , said toms , 29 , who won twice on the nike tour but whose best finish on tour was a third here in 1992 you can put too much pressure on yourself that way i just want a chance on sunday he has it so does edwards , 34 , who got his card back through the qualifying school this year in seven years on tour , edwards s best was 1993 , when he won 150 , 623 first place here pays 225 , 000 , which will do little to calm the nerves of edwards , one of the jumpier players out here putting has always been edwards s biggest problem one season , he was 20th in greens in regulation and did n't keep his card he has gone to the crosshanded method , working with david leadbetter , and the results were positive he drained a 40footer for birdie at the 12th hole to briefly take the lead in the tournament until his fourputt at the last hole putting has always killed me , edwards admitted uncharacteristically , it also slowed mickelson down he threeputted the 10th hole for his only bogey of the day , and he missed makable birdie putts at the parfive 11th hole and the parfour 13th when last seen , the lefthander was working on his stroke on the practice green as the sun set , something that could serve as a harbinger for sunday it is n't often that fans at a golf tournament are paying more attention to the bees than the birds but the grounds at tucson national were abuzz with conversation about the bee attack officials said five spectators were stung , none of them seriously for his part , fergus was matteroffact about his encounter with the bees when an ambulance was called , fergus waved it off with a white towel draped around his arm , fergus said he was n't worried about the stings he is n't allergic to bees , and anticipated no problem teeing it up for the final round and who knows \? he birdied six holes today if he can do the same on sunday , he could scare the leaders as much as the swarm scared him
columbia s undefeated team found a way to win yesterday under horrendous conditions of wind and rain at baker field it took a perfect field goal , and perfect execution of all of the kick s elements , to bring the lions their fifth victory of the season , this one by a 30 score over lafayette so the lions , tied with cornell and dartmouth for first place in the ivy league , will go to new haven with a 50 record next saturday to play yale the last time the columbia team reached 50 was 1945 there was only one big play yesterday in wien stadium and that was the field goal mike jennings snapped the wet football to david ramirez , who set it up , and matt linit kicked it true through the shuddering uprights from 24 yards away with 9 minutes 54 seconds left in the fourth quarter we 've practiced that thousands of times , said jennings , who is also the team s defensive right end yes , but not with the wind coming in gusts of 40 miles an hour from the northeast off the harlem river and carrying sheets of rain along with it given these conditions , the 1 , 170 witnesses in the stands and the players and coaches on both sides knew this would be columbia s best and probably only chance to score lafayette had tried three downwind field goals earlier and all had failed ramirez , the columbia wide receiver and field goal holder said i tried to act calm but i was as scared as i 've ever been linit said , never have i kicked in anything like that , but he said he was n't scared i aimed right down the middle and it went right down the middle , he said i hit a good ball i tried to keep it low so the wind would n't get it the wind distorted every other aspect of the game the lafayette field goal kicker , brian menecola , missed attempts of 52 , 49 and 35 yards i thought i had the last one , he said but the wind pushed it out bill russo , the lafayette coach , said it was n't so much the rain it was the wind brutal field conditions were awful and favored the defense it was tough to pitch the ball to a back , to try to run a toss neither team could throw the ball if you threw it with the wind it sailed , or it kicked up going into the wind the poor punters had to be scared to death that their error was going to lose the game the punters survived , however , and both did well in overcoming the crises of errant center snaps and kicks that were deflected but not blocked columbia s punter was linit , a sophomore from columbia , mo , who kicked 11 times for a 295 average ryan cimo punted for lafayette and had eight punts for a 32yard average one of them went 78 yards with the wind of course offensive players could not sustain their blocks long enough for the quarterbacks to get their handoffs to the tailbacks so lafayette had only 60 net rushing yards from 46 rushes , columbia 96 from 61 running plays first downs were hard to come by , with the lions getting only six and the leopards just five columbia gained a total of just 118 yards from 68 plays , lafayette 76 yards from 58 plays the leopards also fumbled 12 times , losing 3 the problem was the snap of the ball from the center to the quarterback , and russo replaced quarterback shawn mchale with the freshman mike palos in the second half mike has big hands , the better to hold on to the ball , russo said lafayette had five turnovers , columbia none zero turnovers that s phenomenal , columbia coach ray tellier said the columbia scoring drive began on the lafayette 33yard line following a 14yard punt return by roy hanks the columbia strategy then shifted , tellier choosing to go with power from the wishbone formation that was used in earlier games in goalline situations as is customary in that formation , marcellus wiley , the 6foot5inch , 270pound defensive end , moved to right halfback , and he made a key play wiley broke an inside run around left end for a 19yard gain to the lafayette 11 he got us closer , tellier said he made it a short field goal four plays later , with the scrimmage line at the 6 , jennings , ramirez and linit came on the field and did their business extra points columbia s path to an ivy league championship , a title last gained by the lions in 1961 \( and shared that year with harvard \) , involves five more league games these are at yale , at home against princeton , at dartmouth , and home again against cornell and brown the lions have two ivy victories , over harvard and penn , both in overtime photos columbia players after yesterday s victory conditions were horrid at baker field , with punts and fumbles deciding the game \( jose r lopez the new york times \) \( pg 1 \) both teams had trouble moving the football yesterday lafayette had 60 net rushing yards from 46 rushes , columbia 96 from 61 running plays columbia s matt linit , right , after kicking the field goal that accounted for the only points of yesterday s game \( photographs by jose r lopez the new york times \) \( pg 4 \)
stamford , conn , july 23 northeast utilities shut down its connecticut yankee generating plant on monday because of safety concerns , leaving connecticut with none of its four nuclear power plants operating and increasing the risk of blackouts during a heat wave the utility said that even without connecticut yankee , steps it took to secure new power supplies after the nuclear regulatory commission ordered its three millstone point plants closed should prevent blackouts but a spokesman , anthony e nericcio , said the shutdown eats up a great deal of the margin we had the plant , on the connecticut river in haddam neck , had been generating 580 megawatts , about 10 percent of the state s consumption because of safety concerns , the federal agency put all three millstone plants on its watch list of troubled plants in january they remain closed while northeast utilities does repairs and revises procedures northeast utilities has acknowledged that it disregarded not only whistleblowers among its employees but also its own studies showing problems at the millstone plants built in the 1970 s and 80 s when the cost of oil was projected to soar , the plants instead became a burden the millstone closings eliminated about half of northeast utilities' generating capacity as the summer period of peak use approached and northeast , the state s largest utility , warned that reductions in voltage or rolling blackouts might be required during heat waves but it also restarted old fossilfuel generating plants , built new turbines powered by natural gas , contracted for power from outside connecticut and offered large industrial users incentives to close down during periods of extremely high demand northeast utilities had hoped to keep connecticut yankee operating through the summer until a refueling shutdown scheduled for september but mr nericcio said officials began shutting down the plant at 6 30 pm on monday after receiving a safety analysis that showed that some cooling pipes would not function in a hypothetical emergency he said the utility would probably not know until next week how much time it needs to correct the problem the analysis had been ordered after a nuclear regulatory commission inspection of the 28yearold plant , the oldest in connecticut , last spring at the moment , if the weather holds like it has been through the rest of july and august , we should not have a problem , mr nericcio said a spokeswoman for the state department of public utility control , louise ricard , said the plans include the contingency of losing the largest plant , and something else , so this is not outside the parameters of the plans that are already in place
as a miscellany of arresting objects from the distant past , ancient art from the shumei family collection at the metropolitan museum of art is in a very high class as a reasoned survey of a particular point of view , on the other hand , it makes very little sense what are we to make of an anthology that has exactly two items from the whole of ancient egypt , three from ancient rome and no fewer than eight examples of the memorably luxurious garment hooks \( or hat , coat and umbrella stands \) that were made in china more than 2 , 000 years ago \? admittedly , each of these garment hooks is quite unlike any of the others even so , this seems a classic case of imbalance be that as it may , one of the two egyptian objects is presented as the flagship of the show and very arresting it is , too a fulllength seated figure , half man and half bird , from the 13th century bc , it is made of solidcast silver that was formerly almost entirely overlaid with sheet gold the hair of the wig is overlaid with lapis lazuli , and the deepset eyes are of rock crystal though only just over 16 inches high , it radiates authority the human part of the sculpture is enviably lean , but when it comes to holding our attention it politely gives way to the really rather terrifying falcon head above all , the rock crystal gaze stares us down , all the more so , perhaps , because the left eye was restored in 1970 , when the piece was being looked after in a museum in stuttgart , germany the collection is the work of a japanese religious organization called the shinji shumeikai , or the shumei family as a collection , it appears to have no strictly devotional element on the contrary , secular objects of art are its specialty of its overall purposes , all that we learn from the catalogue is that the collection was initiated around 40 years ago , on the belief that unless you can make others happy , you will never be happy yourself from this , few will dissent works of art here i quote from the same source are not to be monopolized by the few , but shown for the delight of the many , that their spirits may be elevated to give that elevation the best possible start , i m pei was asked to design a museum in the mountains near kyoto to house the collection the museum , which is to open in the fall of 1997 , will include the japanese objects in the collection , none of which are on view at the met meanwhile , very little is vouchsafed by any of the 22 contributors to the catalogue as to where , when and how the works were acquired but there is at least one masterwork that has been known since the early 17th century an enormous carpet \( 19 feet 6 inches by 10 feet 6 inches \) that was woven in iran in the late 16th or early 17th century known as the sanguszko carpet , after one of its former owners , it is in amazingly good condition and it needs to be , given the brilliance of its color and the multiplicity of heterogeneous incident that spills this way and that over every square inch of available space this carpet is a bookman s paradise literary echoes are everywhere , as are elements lifted from islamic book design but you do n't need to be a scholar to decipher the tumultuous activities in which men , women and angels mingle with dragon , phoenix and peacock , to name just a few of the storytellers' resources they do n't just sit around , either the catalogue tells of scenes in which dragons intertwine , while peacocks pair off and single animals and birds romp it is the charm of this lopsided but consistently engrossing show that we never know what will come next a recurrent ingredient is the truly monumental piece of jewelry , a specialty of the achaemenid period in iran if you have it , flaunt it was the motto behind many of these pieces a prize instance is the bracelet with seatedduck terminals from the sixth to fourth century bc the massive gold tubular body of the bracelet is impressive enough in itself but when the two seated ducks were added , the piece took on another dimension the ducks are minutely simulated in gold , with lapis lazuli , turquoise , onyx , rock crystal and blue and white vitreous paste here and there , time has brought substantial damage but the flamboyance of the overall gesture is something to marvel at in the chinese section , which in terms of numbers amounts to half the exhibition , there are noble forms that have nothing to do with personal adornment from the western han period , for instance , or second to first century bc , there are two weights in the form of coiled tigers these were not objects of delectation , but indispensable adjuncts to the idea of purity and simplicity in household design without those tigers , mats would curl up at the corners or slide around the room among other pieces of gratuitous but worthwhile information , the show tells us about the changing status of the chariot in china during the western han period to be precise , the chariot lost much of its military importance and became simply something to boast about and sure enough , that loss of soldierly status is reflected in the group of gilt bronze chariot fittings what began as a tiger with its mouth wide open and jaws at the ready turned in time into a tiger that looks sedated and had its mouth shut tight if there is such a thing as a companionable tiger , here he is but it would be unfair to take leave of this wonderfully peculiar show on a note of sedation violence , implied or immediate , is always round the corner , nowhere more so than in the rhyton , or drinking horn , made by a master silversmith in iran or central asia in the first century bc this is a piece that , when filled , would quench even a raging thirst but its particular magic comes from the way in which the silversmith modulates from the plain curved surface to a minutely modeled terminal in which a caracal , or desert lynx , has its way with an unfortunate fowl the eyes , the furry ears , the claws and the concentrated onslaught of the cat are wonderfully rendered so is the plight of the fowl , with life already almost extinct and its feathers , comb and wattles in terminal disarray ancient art from the shumei family collection remains at the metropolitan museum of art , fifth avenue at 82d street , through sept 1 the show then travels to the los angeles county museum of art \( nov 17 to feb 9 ,

kingston , ri , oct 16 an assault on a fraternity house by almost half of the university of rhode island football team left three fraternity members badly beaten and has left students , faculty members , the football coach and the university president shaken and incredulous at the ferocity of the attack it has also disrupted the university s football program as a result of swift action by the coach , floyd keith , and the school s president , robert l carothers keith , who has turned a chronically losing program into a winner , has dismissed two players from the team and indefinitely suspended four others , three of whom are starters the coach also suspended 25 other players for one game , against connecticut this saturday in storrs , conn but those suspensions were in effect extended to the entire 72member squad when carothers announced that uri was forfeiting the yankee conference game to uconn those 25 players have been able to practice this week along with the other members of the squad , and they are expected to play when the team resumes competition with the homecoming game against boston university on oct 26 according to the university police , 31 players are believed to have been involved in an earlyafternoon assault on the theta delta chi fraternity house in the heart of the uri campus on oct 7 even in an era of escalating incidents of campus violence by college athletes , the one here was extraordinary because it involved a coordinated effort on the part of so many of the players capt brian cummings of the university police , who responded to a call from a fraternity member , said that as many as 50 players may have been involved in the incident , which appeared to be in retaliation for the expulsion of two players from a private party at the fraternity house the previous friday night they broke windows , smashed down four doors and beat and kicked a number of our members , rob parsons , a junior from montvale , nj , and the president of the fraternity , said in an interview on tuesday they even threw one of the brothers , who was trying to get away , down a fire escape he could have gotten killed joseph davies , a junior from providence , said there were seven fraternity members in the building when the attack occurred i was in my room on the second floor when i heard a lot of screaming and banging , davies said when i opened the door i saw a bunch of guys maybe 10 or 12 on top of one of the brothers , hitting and kicking him then i ran back to the room with three other brothers and closed the door and they began to kick the door in , screaming 'we 're going to kill you' but by putting our weight on the door , we managed to keep them from coming in i thought of jumping out the window , but then i saw a lot more of them outside on the lawn when i screamed out that i was going to call the police , one of them yelled , 'we do n't care about the cops , we 're the football team' davies and another fraternity member who was in the threestory brick structure said they thought that about 15 players had entered the fraternity house , which is surrounded by classroom buildings on the 2 , 000acre campus in a rural area captain cummings said that by the time the police had arrived , the players , all of whom had apparently come by car , had left the area the three students who had been assaulted were treated at the nearby south county hospital and released one , chris reincke , a junior from guilford , conn , said he sustained a broken elbow along with other injuries based on interviews and an investigation by the university police , carothers and keith took swift action against members of the football team , which has a 33 record this season carothers also announced that the 31 players faced disciplinary actions by the university , which could lead to expulsion one of the frightening things about all of this is that it was premeditated , carothers said what troubles me in particular is that no one stepped forward to stop it and some of the players involved play leadership roles since it happened , i 've heard so many people say , 'what were these guys thinking \? how could they possibly have done something like this \? ' i get the sense that a lot of athletes have become so accustomed to adoration that they believe they 're above the rules but we 're not going to tolerate such offfield aggression on this campus the two players dropped from the team were identified as vincent valerio of saddle river , nj , and carl zschuschen of shrewsbury , mass , both freshman walkons who had not appeared in a game this season parsons , the fraternity president , identified them as the players who had been asked to leave a fraternity party three days before the attack among the players suspended indefinitely were the team s star wide receiver and punt returner , cy butler , a senior from brockton , mass the starting fullback , carnelius cruz , a junior from mays landing , nj the starting center , frank romano , a junior from cliffside park , nj , and willie edwards , the backup sophomore fullback from west warwick , ri captain cummings of the university police said results of the investigation had been turned over to the state attorney general s office and that he expected criminal charges would be filed against three to five players because of the ongoing investigation , keith said , none of the suspended players have been available for interviews ironically , connecticut could have been the big loser as a result of the forfeit carothers has said he assumed that by forfeiting the game against uconn this week the huskies would be credited with a victory and the rams with a defeat but jim wright , the director of statistics at the national collegiate athletic association , said that would not be the case if a game does not take place , under our rules it goes down as a no contest' wright said in a telephone interview but wright conceded that should the outcome of the forfeited game become a factor as to whether uconn , now 33 , receives a bid to the division iaa playoffs , the yankee conference could change things in fact , it did , voting wednesday to award a conference victory to uconn and a conference loss to rhode island the game would n't count in the two schools' overall records connecticut also stands to lose a considerable amount of money from the forfeit a nearcapacity crowd of 13 , 000 was expected for the game on the university s annual youth day , which draws children from throughout the state because of the anticipated financial loss by connecticut , which , among other things , will lose revenues from ticket and concession sales , carothers has pledged to pay uconn a stillundetermined financial sum as compensation keith , the football coach , said he was shocked by his players' actions it surprised me , it disappointed me and it angered me , said keith , in his fourth year as the uri coach it runs counter to everything i had known about my players and to think they thought they were acting as a team where , i wondered , was the mentality out there \? students interviewed on the picturesque rhode island campus seemed to be unanimous in their belief that the football players involved in the assault should not be given preferential treatment i think that the guilty ones should be kicked out of school , heather paige , a junior from providence , said photos the fraternity on rhode island campus where football players were believed to have assaulted students \( matt york for the new york times \) robert l carothers , rhode island s president , left , at news conference with robert drapeau , security director , center , and coach floyd keith \( associated press \)
long after he had reached the level when most law enforcement bureaucrats stop carrying even one gun in a shoulder holster , howard safir sometimes carried a second one at his ankle that is one of the gungho stories told by people who have known mr safir during his 30year law enforcement career colleagues , friends and acquaintances describe mr safir , who became new york city s 39th police commissioner this week , as a tough cop at heart who is fascinated with the drama of law enforcement but also knows about image making and bureaucratic maneuvering he tried to write a novel about cloakanddagger adventures , like those he reveled in as an undercover drug agent with long hair and flowered shirts in the 1960 s as the operations chief of the united states marshals service in the 1980 s , he went into wartime beirut with the code name blue one and a suitcase full of firearms and sat for days in a battered bmw on a stakeout of an american fugitive who had sold arms to libya at the marshals service in washington , he was known for daredevil undercover operations like the one he planned in which more than 100 fugitives were tricked into believing they had won tickets to a redskins football game the guests were served hors d'oeuvres when they showed up at a convention center to collect then they were treated to what the master of ceremonies called the surprise of the day an armed swat team emerged from behind a curtain but none of the stories about mr safir s exploits may describe his qualification to succeed the publicityhungry william j bratton better than this one when he was helping plot the daring capture of edwin p wilson , the rogue former cia agent , in 1982 , mr safir planned to protect an informant by making it look like the marshals service had blundered into the capture , so that the informant would not be identified it was n't that mr safir was shy about taking credit for the plan , e lawrence barcella jr , the federal prosecutor in the wilson case , said it was just that mr safir knew whose praise mattered most he knew that within the justice department , everybody would know mr barcella said rudy would know rudy , of course , was rudolph w giuliani , then an associate attorney general of the united states and a powerful force in the justice department after the tension between mayor giuliani and mr bratton , mr safir s apparent willingness to defer to mr giuliani may have been the leading attribute on his resume people who have known mr safir say that during more than a decade in senior posts in the marshals service , until he left in 1990 , mr safir honed an unusual ability to combine streetlevel law enforcement skills with a facility at the bureaucratic infighting that is often critical for law enforcement leaders larry homenick , now the chief deputy united states marshal in colorado , worked closely with mr safir on a series of highprofile investigations he and other agents credit mr safir with changing the marshals service , the oldest federal law enforcement agency , from a backwater dominated by political appointees into a firstrank agency mr safir , mr homenick said , reinvigorated the marshals service partly through an understanding of how to work the political system mr safir , for example , won justice department approval for the marshals service to take over from the federal bureau of investigation responsibility for tracking fugitives then , he turned what had been a drab task into a glamorous one by tracking billionaire financiers on the lam , fugitive nazis like joseph mengele and escaped spies like christopher boyce , the falcon of the book and movie the falcon and the snowman mr homenick recalled that he got insight into mr safir s approach to leadership when mr safir called him on the carpet once first , mr safir rebuked him for offending a state department official who had grown concerned about a marshals service operation then , he said , mr safir described how to succeed at law enforcement he said to me , 'there s one thing you need to remember , larry perception is reality around here if somebody perceives something , that s the way it is' one perception during his washington years was that mr safir , though sometimes seeming to avoid attention himself , was willing to take risks to garner attention for the agency he was known as ruthless with subordinates who failed for those who crossed him , there was criticism in front of coworkers and there were transfers to unpopular posts howard would certainly be up front with you if he was unhappy , al matney , a marshals service agent who held senior posts under mr safir said mr safir also worked the back channels of law enforcement politics carefully that was no easy task , and it made mr safir unpopular there were a lot of knives out for safir in the justice department , said robert lindsey , who got to know mr safir while writing the flight of the falcon , largely the story of how the marshals service rebuilt its reputation under mr safir s command by tracking and recapturing mr boyce after his escape in 1980 a lot of people were rooting for him to fail , and he did n't
when michele peacock left the great western mortgage corporaton in january 1996 , she and her lawyers thought they had an ironclad sexual harassment suit , one rife with examples of onthejob innuendo at an atlantic city convention , she said , one executive tried to maneuver her into bed as a chance to get to know you better ms peacock sued i wanted my trial by jury , she said there is no doubt in my mind that i would win none but like an increasing number of american workers , she will probably never have her day in court when ms peacock , 31 , joined great western she was required to sign a contract that mandated that any dispute with the company would be settled through binding arbitration the human resources manual contained the rules for arbitration the company would pick the arbitrator , whose fees would largely be paid by great western ms peacock could not win punitive damages or recover lawyers' fees her lawyers could not question opponents and she would get no documents before the hearing ms peacock is now suing for the right to take her case to court tim mcgarry , a spokesman for great western , said the company did not comment on pending litigation ms peacock is not alone employers increasingly use employment contracts not only for traditional purposes protecting trade secrets and limiting competition from former employees but to be able to dismiss employees without being sued and to insulate themselves from discrimination suits a poll commissioned in 1995 by robert half international , a headhunting firm , found that 30 percent of united states companies with 20 or more employees planned to increase their use of employment contracts , compared with 17 percent that said they would decrease the use of the contracts these contracts for lowerlevel workers are a far cry from what employment contract often brings to mind when applied to top executives milliondollar bonuses and golden parachute severance agreements people are signing away their right to take their claims to federal court , and they are signing away their right not to be discriminated against , said ellen j vargyas , a lawyer for the equal employment opportunity commission employers counter that employees have abused rights granted under a 1991 amendment to the civil rights act of 1964 the law , called title vii , provides for jury trials and allows punitive damages in discrimination cases but dismissed workers , employers say , often claim sex , age , race and religious discrimination unfairly an employee who loses a job just has to find one of those cubbyholes to fit their claim in , said john robinson , the chairman of the american bar association s employment and labor relations litigation committee in tampa , fla , everyone is a protected something even a white male can claim reverse discrimination employers say that without mandating arbitration , employees would choose jury trials , which are expensive for both parties arbitration brings the recurring costs of discovery and appeals under control , said mr mcgarry of great western he also said arbitration levels the playing field a company with vast resources ca n't wear down an opponent with fewer resources , he said lawyers say courts have been blurring distinctions between at will employees , who can be dismissed without being told a reason , and just cause employees , who can be let go only for poor work or misconduct what s changed is courts in several states find bland statements in handbooks , comments on growing up together and making lots of money in the future , two good reviews and a comment at the company christmas party and accept these as a contract , said william f highberger , a lawyer at gibson , dunn crutcher , which often represents employers such contracts were born in the securities industry , which has long required all employees to sign an arbitration agreement this practice has withstood several attacks in court , forcing employees into arbitration , where they frequently fare less well than before a jury paul de nisco of staten island is a former trader for merrill lynch who signed a mandatory arbitration agreement in 1990 he wanted to sue his employer for age discrimination in 1991 when , at 48 , despite years of good employee reviews , he was dismissed during what merrill lynch said was a reorganization of mr de nisco s department in 1995 , mr de nisco went into arbitration with what he thought was a strong piece of evidence a page of notes written in 1992 by a 30yearold manager nancy smith of west orange , nj , one of mr de nisco s lawyers , said the page was notes taken from a conversation the manager had with mr de nisco s equally young boss she said the note showed that the manager had been directed to hire someone our age male for another department and showed a predisposition of the company to hire young workers timothy gilles , a spokesman for merrill lynch , said on thursday , these notes do not indicate any discriminatory intent or conduct at merrill lynch , and the claimant did not attempt to present any evidence to the contrary arbitrators denied mr de nisco s claim i wrote a letter asking the arbitrators for their rationale , mr de nisco said they said they do n't have to tell me and they do n't want to no appeal is allowed
east rutherford the meadowlands sports complex , one of the world s largest entertainment centers , opened 20 years ago on a 750acre site that once was swamp since then , it has drawn millions to its stadium , racetrack and arena for football , soccer , hockey , horse racing and popular entertainment pope john paul ii celebrated mass there the grateful dead recreated the 60 s but nothing of such magnitude happens spontaneously it takes a work force of ushers , waiters , ticket takers , security officers 3 , 000 in all , who work at the gates , in the stands and behind the scenes some took their jobs as a lifeline , part time , in an uneasy economy others looked upon them as additional income to help support a family a few signed up just to be sociable and have fun here is a visit with four of them , their reasons for being there as varied as the events that help provide their livelihood louis deangelo at the window he dreamed of being a beautician , but life did n't turn out that way so when the shoe store closed on him and construction work faded , louis deangelo went to the track it was 1976 , and the meadowlands was about to open with the promise of worldclass entertainment and jobs for the masses jobless at 23 , mr deangelo felt the call of a job as a cashier at the 2 window , deciding to stake his future on the horses and those who would spend their days handing him money in search of a lucky ticket that was 20 years and countless gamblers ago for the wiry cashier , who now works the highend 50 window at the meadowlands racetrack , handling perhaps 60 , 000 in bets on a given night it is a vigil , mr deangelo said , noting that he must be both quick and cautious because any shortfall in the receipts at the end of the night is his responsibility and comes out of his pocket he s been taken only once , he said it was 1977 , and he lost 1 , 000 out of the till either someone in line did it or someone outside , he said , shaking his head i guess it was just a reach into my window , but i 'll never know the fear of a recurrence keeps him on his toes , as do the scammers and flimflam artists who creep about daily with such schemes on their minds sometimes they will just say they have been given the wrong change when making a bet , although good cashiers know always to leave the money on the tray until the transaction is finished but there are a surprising number of grifters with the time to concoct elaborate traps one favorite is to paste the edges of a 50 bill onto the face of a dollar , a trick that can go unnoticed when jittery bettors press long lines before a race other times , people have come up with a wad of bills to make a bet of several thousand dollars but once all the bills are counted , the cashier will find a 100 , some 20 s and a few dollar bills sandwiching a loaf of perfectly cut paper by the time it is counted , the cheater is usually long gone others fake winning tickets by surgically carving a losing ticket so that the correct numbers can be inserted you 'd be surprised how much time people will spend on these things to keep betting , he said they try to beat you you got to be like a boxer and roll with it it s part of the game he still thinks about hair styling sometimes , but he is not complaining about working the windows , a skill he learned through one trial session with play money before the official opening as he is quick to note , things could be worse he is happily married , with a 5yearold son and an 18yearold daughter now at montclair state university i'm not going to get rich from this job , but after 20 years i ca n't complain because there are a lot of people out there who go out and break their backs every day , he said i 've been able to provide for my family and pay my bills i was brought up workingclass and like i tell my kids all the time , you ca n't get nothing unless you work for it i'm proving that by example bob jacques finding motivation for 15 years , bob jacques has been studying acting at the meadowlands , looking into customers' faces and listening to their disputes , all to get an insight into character i see people at their best and at their worst , in all situations from love to dragout fights , he said you just get to see people the way they really are , and that s good when you 're an actor but at the meadowlands , mr jacques is an usher , in maroon jacket and sensible shoes off duty , he pursues an acting career he has appeared on several commercials as well as a few movies and sitcoms when not taking tickets or helping patrons to their seats no one has recognized him yet his latest acting job was in a movie called devil s own , he said , noting that his experiences at the meadowlands particularly with unruly fans and fights on the ice during hockey games helped him get the part of a mobster roughing up brad pitt although he says he is nice with the customers , they do not always reciprocate he recalls one night when a big fight broke out on the ice , causing bloodhungry hockey fans in the front rows to leap from their seats for a better view when he calmly asked them to sit back , another man rows back jumped up and began cursing mr jacques for blocking his view of the fight he ran at me screaming , the usher said it was so weird that even the guys who first stood up thought it was a joke , but it was n't he was really mad and just kept screaming till i left i guess that s the one thing i dread about the job , the fact that you sometimes get really arrogant people on you , but you have to treat them all the same , he said
n w ayer partners , the oldest and perhaps most troubled of the major american advertising agencies , said yesterday that it would be acquired by d'arcy masius benton bowles , signaling a new crest in the wave of deals that are remaking madison avenue for the second time in a decade the agreement closes a crucial chapter in the history of the agency founded in philadelphia in 1869 as n w ayer son in a bit of legerdemain that may have prefigured the advertising world s flexibility with facts , the founder was not n w ayer but the son , francis wayland ayer ayer created one of the earliest national ad campaigns , for uneeda biscuits , and popularized slogans that ranged from when it rains it pours for morton salt to reach out and touch someone for att to a diamond is forever for debeers ayer helped introduce the bell telephone system , camel cigarettes , canada dry soft drinks and the model a ford but ayer fell on hard times in the 1990 s as competitors surged ahead , exploiting the agency s loss of several large advertising accounts like j c penney and turmoil caused by a fastspinning revolving door on the executive suite ayer has fallen further behind in the last year as rivals have grown larger through a spate of buyouts and takeovers reminiscent of the deals that rocked and reshaped the industry in the 1980 s d'arcy masius benton bowles , the world s 12thlargest agency company , will acquire both ayer and its parent company , adcom investors inc , which obtained control of ayer in 1993 terms of the deal , which comes after weeks of speculation , were not disclosed dmb b was itself a product of a merger in 1986 between two venerable agencies with heritages almost as old as ayer s , in a deal that was a cornerstone of the transactions that transformed the advertising world a decade ago the difference that a decade has brought to advertising deals has been one of motivation in the 1980 s , the takeovers were part of a feeding frenzy predicated on the belief that huge verticalagency powerhouses could handle all of a client s needs under one roof , from product design to public relations to marketing moreover , there was a fair amount of rampant egos seeking deals for the sake of dealing , said james dougherty , an analyst who follows the advertising and publishing industries for dean witter reynolds in new york by contrast , he added , it s a lot more sensible now the deals make sense for the buyer as well as the seller many of the madison avenue mergers of the last six months have been brought about by the conviction that horizontal connections in which agencies are more loosely joined in federations are the way to compete globally as the century ends such choices , known as offering clients additional agency brands or agency networks , can reduce the possibility of conflicts of interest between competing marketers , thus improving the chances of landing an account for instance , in the largest deal so far this year , the omnicom group , which owns agencies that produce ads for auto makers like dodge , nissan and porsche , acquired ketchum communications , which handles the account of the acura line of luxury cars sold by honda dmb b will operate ayer autonomously as a second agency network , meaning that potential clients could choose to have their accounts handled by either it s a perfect fit for both organizations , roy j bostock , chairman and chief executive of dmb b , said in a telephone interview from st louis , where he was visiting a client for instance , he noted that dmb b and ayer shared a pair of clients , the general motors and the procter gamble company it s a terrific strategic move for us , mr bostock said , because we needed to develop a second network , a second brand to give us broader reach and appeal in a consolidating marketplace and it preserves ayer as a separate organization we finally have come together , he added it s been a long courtship his reference was to merger talks that date to the early 1980 s , involving ayer and both dmb b progenitors , d'arcy macmanus masius and benton bowles mary lou quinlan , president and chief executive of ayer , which like dmb b is based in new york , said , we 'll still be ayer the name , the people , the culture , will not disappear i'm pretty excited about that dmb b is much larger than ayer , with more than 6 , 400 employees in 155 offices in 72 countries who handle accounts with billings estimated at 57 billion among other bluechip clients of dmb b are cocacola , mars inc , the pillsbury company unit of grand metropolitan plc and trans world airlines by comparison , ayer , the 30th largest agency company , has 585 employees in only one country , the united states , after selling a network of agencies overseas those employees based in offices in chicago , detroit and los angeles in addition to new york handle accounts with billings estimated at 800 million among ayer s other wellknown clients are avon products inc , the gillette company and the kitchenaid division of the whirlpool corporation
it must be difficult to build a program that can accommodate bright sheng s h'un \( lacerations \) subtitled in memoriam 196676 , the 20minute piece is a wrenchingly direct orchestral evocation of the chinese cultural revolution and its horrors , a time the 40yearold composer lived through before he moved to the united states when gerard schwarz led the new york chamber symphony in its premiere , in 1988 , h'un made everything around it seem trivial , particularly the chopin second piano concerto , which followed it kurt masur had a better solution in 1993 , when he coupled it with shostakovich s equally grim babi yar symphony but the full orchestra version he conducted softened the taut , searing edges of the original chamber orchestra version as part of a retrospective 20thanniversary season , mr schwarz revisited the original version at alice tully hall on sunday afternoon , and if the companion works he chose were not as correspondingly dark as mr masur s shostakovich , they seemed a reasonable compromise hindemith s nobilissima visione shared the first half of the program with mr sheng s work , and after the intermission mr schwarz collaborated with alicia de larrocha on a sensitively shaped reading of the beethoven piano concerto no 4 mr sheng s work has lost none of its lapelgrabbing quality , and momentary intonation problems notwithstanding , mr schwarz and his players projected it with admirable resolve its insistent string writing , forceful and occasionally exotic percussion and dissonant brass clusters create an almost cinematic sense of horror , and when the intensity lets up momentarily for an eerie flute solo over static strings , hopelessness and foreboding continue to hang in the air the complete original ballet of hindemith s nobilissima visione , which had its new york premiere at a new york chamber symphony concert in 1989 , was a reasonable foil for mr sheng s meditation composed in 1937 , and most familiar these days as an orchestral suite from which many episodes have been ejected , the work looks at the life of st francis of assisi , with his vision of three women representing poverty , obedience and charity as a central , mystical element hindemith s scoring is both picturesque and demanding , and mr schwarz rose to the challenge of turning the notes into imagery , without the benefit of dancers and scenery here the orchestra was at its best in addition to a warm string and wind sound , and admirably transparent textures , there were remarkable solo contributions by mark hutchinson , trombonist judith mendenhall , flutist , and ellen katz , violist in the beethoven , ms de larrocha s solo line had the eloquence and songfulness one expects of her , and the players countered with the sharply contrasting gestures that make this concerto an elevated conversation rather than a battle for the spotlight the program is to be repeated tonight

durango , colo late one dark night in oakland , calif , i was leaving a movie theater , after watching every last credit roll , when i noticed that my car was the only one left in the parking lot i stepped around a homeless man sitting on the theater steps he asked me for money , and i told him , honestly , that i had none as i headed for my car , he followed me i was new to the city and had n't learned much about urban survival , but i put my keys between my fingers as they advise on tv and kept walking i was 10 steps from my car when a sharp object jabbed me in the back , and the man , his voice tight to my ear , said , i bet you 'd feel different if i had a gun in my hand it already had n't been one of my best days in fact , it had n't been one of my best weeks i 'd been fighting with my boyfriend , fighting with my boss , fighting with my best friend well , i might feel different , i said , whirling around , but i still would n't have any money he tipped back on his heels almost imperceptibly , and all of a sudden i was n't in oakland anymore i was back in alaska , where i 'd been a wilderness guide for five seasons the man was no longer a mugger , he was a grizzly bear instead of being out of my element , i was suddenly back in the center of it , and what i knew , what his slight backward gesture told me , was that if i wanted this grizzly bear , he was mine and i think i should tell you , i said , my eyes never leaving his , never moving down to the cold thing whatever it was in his pocket , that i 've had a really emotional day , and i think you ought to let me get in my car and go home in alaska , if you encounter a bear , you hope it turns and runs off into the tundra in oakland , the man teetered on his heels , his eyes flashing like a traffic light between anger and uncertainty so i gambled and walked the remaining steps to my car , hunkered and tough as a grizzly myself , started the engine and drove away my family lived in pennsylvania when i was a girl , 15 miles from where the appalachian trail descends from the pocono mountains on its way across the state my parents were not outdoors people , but i knew even then that i would be , and electricity would shoot through me whenever we 'd drive along the roads that crisscrossed the trail we 'd see the signs , one pointing toward maine , one toward georgia , and i 'd vow each time we passed that i 'd walk the trail from end to end when i was a teenager , my girlfriends and i would skip school just to hike the trail in the course of an afternoon , we 'd always walk the same five or six miles , and i could feel the magic of the trail rise up through my boot soles the way i feel it now in other , grander places escalante canyon in utah , new zealand s fox glacier , the top of the cordillera real in bolivia , the brooks range in alaska \( where i share the landscape with grizzly bears \) i never did walk the entire appalachian trail i moved out west , where the trails were wilder , the bugs fewer and the weather so much better but i never forgot my desire to walk from maine to georgia , never forgot how those two little signs could excite me , even before i 'd spent my first night out under the stars earlier this month , the bodies of two young women were found with their throats slit near the part of the appalachian trail that runs through shenandoah national park in virginia they were 24 and 26 years old and had trained as wilderness guides they had pitched their tent near a stream , not far from a scenic drive that runs through the park if they were anything like me , their worries were limited to the blisters on their feet and the scattered showers in the forecast if they were anything like me , the last thing on their minds was a violent death at the hands of another human being the deaths raise the question of why we go outdoors in the first place is it , as one reporter suggested , to get away from reality , to seek a perfect sanctuary from the real world of murder and violent crime \? i spend approximately 100 nights a year outdoors , backpacking , dog sledding , skiing , running rivers , sailing , and i have come face to face with nearly every lifethreatening experience the outdoors can dish up avalanches , hurricanes , mudslides , lightening storms , flash floods , blizzards , hypothermia , frostbite , fatigue in the wilderness , i feel not as though i am escaping the real world but that i am entering it there is an essential part of myself that gets lost in my indoor life a part as necessary and tangible as an arm or an eye and i go to the wilderness to get it back in some moments , it is a place of sanctuary in other moments , it is the most violent place i know when i hear someone talk about the wilderness as a safe haven from the real world , i understand more than ever how we have become unhealthy as a human race physically , psychologically and spiritually we have lost our connection to the natural world the outdoors is a place of loss and regeneration , of danger and of beauty , of ritual and rebirth anyone who has been trained as a guide would find it impossible to think of the back country as a perfect sanctuary anyone who has been trained as a guide knows that if the grizzly bear wants you badly enough , he s going to get you every time it is that knowledge , among many other things , that sends us back to the wilderness again and again when one human enters the forest and kills another , it is not evidence that something is wrong with the forest it is evidence of how one person has lost the sense of himself or herself as a member of the human species , as a creature , as an animal who is here to breathe and eat , to sleep and bear children , to raise them and to die naturally , to walk on the earth and wonder at it , to share it with other living things the brutal killing of julianne williams and lollie winans is , as the director of the national park service said , an occasion not for panic but for sorrow it is an occasion to wonder when we started calling the technovirtualmegamachine we have created in our cities the real world it is an occasion not to stay away from wild places but to rethink our relationship to them , to begin to learn again the lessons they have to teach i was mugged again that year , this time for real , in san francisco , and i did n't have the opportunity to use my wilderness skills pam houston from behind with the lead pipe in the tenderloin is how we would say it if we were kids again playing the board game clue the muggers got the 18 in my pocket and my car keys , and i got a night in the hospital and the last reason i needed to leave the city for good and go back to the mountains my sanctuary , my tempest , the most real world i know
albuquerque , n m , march 16 this is still better than the hospital gene keady spent half of his basketball season with doctors and nurses , which is why purdue s nosedive today did not leave him totally numb the boilermakers missed enough shots for four teams this afternoon , did not resemble a no 1seeded team and enabled georgia coach tubby smith to go where he usually goes the round of 16 and smith s traveling companion and opponent in the west regional semifinals will be syracuse , which might as well have played today s game in the palestra diminutive drexel a school from the heart of philadelphia was adopted this afternoon by the entire state of new mexico and literally struck fear into the orangemen drexel s band played the theme from the movie rocky and its fans chanted , we are rocky , but , in the end , syracuse won this secondround game on this nonneutral floor , 6958 do n't want to come back real soon , syracuse coach jim boeheim said drexel appreciated the support , whereas purdue s coach keady , a 7669 loser to georgia , appreciated the mere sight of his 30yearold daughter back on jan 10 , lisa keady slipped in her alpine , nj , kitchen , hit her head and lapsed into a coma a maid discovered her barely in time , according to doctors , and keady flew to see her the next day only to hear more paralyzing news his father had died lloyd keady had toiled in a kansas greenhouse for 50 years , was his son gene s hero , and now the son had a season to finish it ended today , but with typical keady stubbornness eighthseeded georgia , which had won 9 of its final 10 regularseason games to earn this bid to the west regional , led by as many as 12 in the second half , but still needed two acrobatic blocked shots to fend off purdue s mad rush three times the boilermakers were within 5 points in the final three minutes , but georgia stonewalled a team that had won three straight big 10 titles were the boilermakers overrated \? well , this game we were , i guess , keady said the boilermakers \( 266 \) were never closer than 7065 , with 1 minute 11 seconds remaining , and that is about the time georgia \( 219 \) started swatting away their shots the bulldogs' 6foot10inch center terrell bell \( 15 points , 8 rebounds and 7 blocks \) rejected one of the purdue attempts , and forward carlos strong \( 17 points and 8 rebounds \) knocked yet another into the seats then , katu davis s swift layup against the purdue press iced the game with a minute left keady was definitely incensed enough to yell at georgia s smith for calling what he considered a rubitin timeout with 63 seconds remaining but the coach hugged his daughter afterward she still has complications from the fall , but sat in the stands today and did her best to sing the purdue fight song when something like that happens , like it did to her , you think , 'why was i worried about basketball \? ' keady said late today as for georgia coach smith , the sweet 16 is almost an annual rite he guided tulsa to the round of 16 in both 1994 and 1995 , and in this , his first season at georgia , he assembled a nice team to yell at it is smith s custom to berate his players , but they played today with enough grace to shut him up the front line of strong , bell and shandon anderson orchestrated a 202 run in the first half that sent purdue into a panic , and the boilermakers \( who shot only 37 percent \) had not a single person to shoot them back in when you 're not overly talented like us , you have to play hard , keady said of his club , which featured four senior starters they 're all great kids , but none are going to play in the nba , probably but syracuse s john wallace will be there , and soon drexel s malik rose is the shaq of the nac \( north atlantic conference \) but wallace is the one who will see the real shaquille o'neal in the near future wallace outscored rose , 1811 , and was also lucky to have his weakkneed point guard lazarus sims , whose right knee was dying for an ice pack , drilled consecutive 3point shots with five minutes to go , and that carved out syracuse s first comfortable lead in one fell swoop , the orangemen s lead had grown from 5046 to 5646 , with 4 44 to play , and drexel was never closer than 8 points again fourthseeded syracuse \( 268 \) will be favored over no 8 georgia next friday in denver , but apparently the orangemen are remaining humble the sweet 16 has been the end of the line for syracuse every season since 1989 , and seniors like wallace still had furrowed brows tonight all of us have been to the sweet 16 , wallace said that wo n't be anything new to us we 're not going out to denver just to play ball meanwhile , boeheim , the maligned coach , had every reason to gloat his strategy on rose to front him , pitch a tent around him was executed perfectly by center otis hill \( 16 points , 8 rebounds \) his strategy to yell in the face of every drexel shooter worked , too twelfthseeded drexel \( 274 \) had upset fifthseeded memphis on thursday with radar shooting , but tonight its accuracy from 3point land was freezing cold 6 for 30 boeheim decided to challenge two particular drexel marksmen , mike derocckis and jeff meyers , and dared a third player , chuck guittar , to keep launching guittar took the bait and ended up bending the rim , going 0 for 6 on the other hand , it was drexel s master plan to leave sims all alone and pitch its tent around wallace it worked , for the most part , for 35 minutes until sims sent the prodrexel crowd searching for another underdog he 'd been saving those 3 s all year , boeheim said with a wan smile photo purdue had trouble keeping up with georgia s speed thebulldogs' pertha robinson driving past herb dove , left , and porter robert \( associated press \)
four years ago , a faltering economy persuaded american voters to give bill clinton a chance as president yesterday , surveys of voters leaving the polls showed , a robust economy persuaded them that he deserved a second term four years ago , only 39 percent of voters said they thought the country was headed in the right direction a key indicator of the nation s mood that figure grew this year to 53 percent but mr clinton s success in occupying the vital center , as he called it in his victory statement , in a phrase borrowed from the historian arthur m schlesinger jr , did not extend to capitol hill he and his party failed in their quest to recapture control of the senate , and they appeared headed for failure in the struggle for dominance of the house of representatives so he and his country face two more years at least of divided government after a campaign filled with fundraising abuses on a grand scale , mr clinton pledged early action on campaignfinance reform his vice president , al gore , said he was ready to work with the republicans , and the president himself said , it is time to put country ahead of party but appeals to eschew partisanship may be lost in the clamor of investigations of alleged scandals in the first clinton administration the returns showed little diminution in the conservative trend that has coursed through the country since the 1970 s the new senate will be more conservative than the old in california , the most publicized initiative of the year , opposing affirmative action , was approved bob dole did everything he could to refocus the presidential contest , the last of the 20th century , as mr clinton said so often he quit the senate he abandoned his longterm insistence that deficit reduction must take precedence over tax cuts he chose jack kemp , with whom he had often quarreled , as a running mate he tried to persuade ross perot to withdraw he gambled everything on a long shot in california , where he had little chance at the end , like george bush in 1992 , he assailed mr clinton s character and ethical standards none of it worked none of his tactical zigs and none of his tactical zags changed the strategic reality presidents , even presidents like this one , mistrusted by the electorate , are unlikely to be cast from office in times of peace and prosperity especially when the president is as politically adept as mr clinton mr dole , 23 years older , reared in a bygone political culture , could not match the president as a campaigner he provided this wistful analysis of his own in an interview with cnn shortly before the end of the campaign you have to give the president credit he s a very smooth talker he hits the right buttons he 'll adopt things , things the republican congress has passed the discombobulation of mr dole s campaign was epitomized when the campaign prematurely sent to newsrooms a fax conceding that he had lost after a flurry of telephone calls , he became the first presidential candidate in history to unconcede , however temporarily mr clinton also had a valuable electoral insurance policy his popularity \( and his main rival s unpopularity \) among women , which apparently resulted at least in part from the republican party s resolute stand against abortion but it was not just abortion there was an even larger gender gap in the massachusetts senate contest , where both candidates defended abortion rights in the presidential campaign , it was almost as if there were two elections , one for men , who gave mr dole a majority , and one for women , who gave the president a larger one so mr clinton , derided in 1993 , humiliated by a republican sweep in 1994 , forced to defend his own political relevance in 1995 , won a second term something accomplished by only two other democrats in this century it was a remarkable achievement , especially for one so tainted by scandal more than half those who voted said they doubted the president s trustworthiness he did better than he had four years ago , approaching if not reaching 50 percent , though not quite as well as some of his strategists had hoped florida , where mr clinton lost by a hair four years ago , swung easily into his column this time , perhaps because the state s many elderly voters believed the democrats when they said the republicans threatened medicare one of the sun belt megastates , florida constituted one of the night s big prizes nowhere in the early returns did mr dole surprise his best big state was texas , but he was unable effectively to challenge mr clinton anywhere in the broad swath of states that form the northeast quadrant of the country from ohio to maine and south to maryland and missouri he took only indiana mr clinton swept the pacific coast states mr dole showed more strength in the south , but not nearly enough , and a good deal more in his native region , the great plains the larger question , unanswered in the voting , was what kind of secondterm president bill clinton would prove to be the liberal of his first two years \? the moderate of his second two \? operating under financial stringency , his options will be limited , and they may be limited further if , as anticipated , the final tally leaves the republicans in control of both houses of congress
washington , march 21 emphatically rebuffed as presidential timber , representative robert k dornan is taking comfort in his old capitol routine of fervidly upbraiding the activist homosexual lobby and rudely equating the aids virus in the military with syphilis fiftyfive signatures in the senate to protect , for the first time in history , a venereal disease , the congressman snapped dismissively of the senate s attempt to repeal the new dornansponsored law purging hivinfected military people from active service the crunch of mr dornan in legislative debate served as a reminder that in his run for the presidency still theoretically alive in his mind the congressman was rarely to be noticed out there as the roughmouthed master of confrontation that made his reputation as a feisty paleocon in the first place it was as if , unlike senator bob dole or steve forbes or even morry taylor , the renown of mr dornan somehow lessened , not grew , on the presidential primary hustings in congress , he is a hyperkinetic politician whom democrats consider notorious for his attacks on president clinton as a philanderer who should have been spayed but on the national trail , mr dornan seemed far from the antagonist of whom representative barney frank , the massachusetts democrat , once said , right job , wrong planet but suffering anonymity is not a possibility that the 62yearold california republican would entertain in recounting the high points of his yearlong indulgence of the ultimate fantasy of so many politicians faith , family and freedom , rasped mr dornan , reciting the slogan that he insists the other candidates adopted from him in one of many subtle campaign influences in this , he sounds as amiable as broadway danny rose in delivering showbiz counsel to his featured acts \( strong smile star \) and dole had to adopt my 'the target is clinton , ' he added , taking credit as the conciliator who cautioned against intramural bickering in the crowded republican field my ego is n't bruised at all , insisted mr dornan , threadbare of delegates and 300 , 000 lighter in campaign funds , but unbowed in measuring his personal highwater mark as a fifthplace finish in the maine straw poll last autumn actually , another peak came during the televised new hampshire debate last month when senator dole suddenly displayed family photographs to dispel the negative dole images of his rivals' attack ads just as quickly , mr dornan grinned and flashed a glossy baby photograph of his 10th grandchild , moira it was n't a setup , he said , denying he played mr dole s second banana he explained that he had expected a question about his opposition to abortion and so brought the baby picture along for vivid rebuttal i 've had the best year i 've ever had , boomed mr dornan , barely a percentile finisher in the primaries but waxing invincible in the capitol corridors as he strolled , the lawmaker brachiated nonstop among topics , from the valor of firefighters to the enviable cushion of mr forbes s inherited millions from fundraising plans for a 10th dornanforcongress run to the need of the victorious republican , mr dole , to have an overall strategy forced on him you ca n't beat clinton without a battle plan , so we 'll have to have a battle plan for dole , said mr dornan , never shy from extending unbid political advice , even to a winner he expects to fold his own presidential hand after the california primary next tuesday and urge mr dole to name his chief cabinet officers during the campaign to compete team versus team against mr clinton , rather than head to head the art of running for president , mr dornan has concluded , is a cumulative deed of repeated attempts , a la mr dole a relentless process that mr dornan senses has only just begun for himself i decided to get this one out of the way , he explained , so that if i ever wanted to look at it with the intent of winning or becoming a frontrunner , i would have that early historical annoyance out of the way the only thing nettlesome about running , he said , was the oftheard question , who do you think you are , running for president \? the idea it s offensive dornan s in the race , said the congressman , clearly miffed none of the other candidates thought there was anything offensive about me or any people who did n't have a realistic chance lugar what chance \? morry taylor \? ! oh , 'quixotic' is ok but it was like , 'who are you , a lowly congressman \? ' you mean i'm not a lowly halfbillionaire like steve forbes \? mr dornan is one of those politicians who are at least as interesting when they lose as when they win bob dornan was right from the gitgo , exulted the once and future candidate , confirming he knew all along that mr dole would win but you 've got to get that first one out of the way so why not do it in a year when you know who the winner is \? photo representative robert k dornan , choosing the korean warmemorial as a backdrop last year , asserts that my ego is n't bruised at all \( fred r conrad the new york times \)
los angeles john pogue s name has never scrolled across a movie screen but you would n't know it from a visit to the sundappled bungalow at 20th century fox , where this 31yearold writer is plotting his career with the panache of a young orson welles on a recent afternoon , mr pogue could be found fielding telephone calls from his agent and from executives at two major film studios in less than two hours , he had negotiated a pair of scriptpolishing assignments worth 425 , 000 one assignment calls for mr pogue to revise his own screenplay for the sequel to the fugitive , which is likely to begin shooting next february at 4 pm , mr pogue instructed his assistant to put his calls on hold so that he could meet with two young writers who are developing an action screenplay for his newly formed production company as the pair listened raptly , mr pogue rattled off suggestions on how to simplify the script a somewhat muddled yarn about a unit of special forces soldiers that goes awol we do n't want people to come out of the theater saying , 'what a convoluted piece of junk , ' he said matteroffactly after the meeting , mr pogue strolled across fox s lot past the cavernous sound stages where speed and die hard were filmed to pay a call on sanford panitch , a studio senior vice president the 29yearold mr panitch had signed mr pogue to a oneyear , 1 million deal now he was trying to cajole him into rewriting the script for a forthcoming fox film back in his bungalow , with the afternoon sun slanting through the windows , mr pogue acknowledged that all this hubbub seemed unreal after nine years of trying unsuccessfully to get his first movie made , mr pogue suddenly finds himself courted by some of the heaviest hitters in hollywood i do n't think my parents quite understand what i'm doing , said mr pogue , whose round face and warm smile make him look less like a young welles than an earnest dom deluise i have a hell of a time explaining it to myself , let alone to them what mr pogue is doing is savoring the fruits of success , hollywood style it is a type of success common to the film industry but utterly alien to more earthbound professions like law , medicine or politics to studio executives , the fact that mr pogue does not have a single screen credit is almost beside the point merely by selling three scripts for sixfigure amounts , he has proved he has a knack for writing commercial action films mr pogue is not the only writer with that knack , of course he s also not the only uncredited screenwriter with a thriving career but his story epitomizes the peculiar values of the movie business a funhouse world where talent and buzz count as much , perhaps even more , than actual accomplishment everybody in this town wants to jump on a fast train , said neal moritz , a 37yearold film producer , who purchased mr pogue s first two scripts for morgan creek productions in 1994 for a total of 750 , 000 right now , john is a very fast train in an industry desperate for salable story ideas , mr pogue s skills make him a hot commodity someone worth coddling with a lucrative studio deal , cushy offices on the lot , even his own parking space to quote the natives , he has heat mr pogue is particularly sought after because he specializes in technothrillers , a genre for which hollywood has a ravenous appetite successful technothrillers like independence day and mission impossible can make a studio s entire year while authors like tom clancy generate plenty of raw material for these movies , the demand still outstrips the supply as a result , executives like mr panitch are forever on the prowl for the writer who can come up with the next independence day armed with some good ideas and properly represented , a writer like that can parlay modest success into something quite big , said dave wirtschafter , a talent agent at international creative management , which represents some of hollywood s biggest names , including spike lee , mel gibson and barbra streisand doubts follow success for mr pogue , success has forced him to confront several issues in quick and bewildering order should he continue to write as a freelancer or sign up with a single studio \? should he focus on his own scripts or fill his time with rewriting assignments \? should he concentrate exclusively on technothrillers or explore other genres \? and most fundamental , for someone who until a few years ago lived in a shabby venice beach apartment , what should he do with all the cash suddenly rolling in \? the first thing mr pogue and his wife , alexa , did was to move into a modest but comfortable house in west hollywood they also traded in their rickety subaru justy for a jeep cherokee mr pogue converted a backyard shed into a writing room , complete with french doors , plush leather chairs and a sturdy writing desk and he put in a tiny fountain , which gurgles serenely , just outside these days , mr pogue spends his mornings writing on a laptop computer in his booklined retreat he drives over to fox at noon , where he frequently meets his agent , scott henderson , for lunch at the commissary he spends the rest of the day in his office \( just downstairs from the office of tom hanks \) , where he makes dozens of phone calls and discusses projects with his wife , his assistant , ilana ettinger , and his director of creative development , marilyn roberts , who also happens to be his motherinlaw
in the late 1940 s in memphis , when b b king , then a local disk jockey , was starting to perform as a musician , he made a series of selfconscious decisions he wanted the sound of a gospel quartet , but since the line between secular and religious music had n't been crossed , he settled for a horn section to play the role he combined the music of his four favorite guitarists , django reinhardt , charlie christian , lonnie johnson and blind lemon jefferson , into a distinct improvisational style he invoked , rhythmically and with the instrumentation of his small band , the sound and power of the best big bands in his borrowing , he came up with the perfect sound for a postwar america , that of rural culture moving to the city , sophisticated and urban with mud on its boots mr king also perfectly understood the uses of his instrument , the electric guitar , and on tuesday night at the blue note he took advantage of all the infinite shadings that electricity can provide he played long , unbroken lines , bending one note into the next , sometimes using vibrato so that the beginning and ending of notes disappeared , sometimes changing his attack so that lines seemed to be speaking he made his tone rough by pressuring his amplifier into distortion he chopped some notes short , and let others drift until they faded mr king is in his early 70 s , and in this set there was a lifetime s worth of skill and technique on display every note he played had a personality of its own mr king is a road warrior , spending a good part of the year playing concerts , and his choice of material stays basically the same , night after night tuesday was no different he performed rock me baby and five long years and the thrill is gone and he still uses the same jokes , lines that should have wilted several decades ago but his manner is imbued with such playfulness , in the way he approaches his solos , in the improvisations he plays , in the evident pleasure he gets from the stories he tells , that none of it seems stale occasionally he would put his right hand on his neck and , with a nonchalant look , generate sound with just his left on the neck of his guitar when he sang , she kicked me out , the drums banged out a kicking sound for mr king , it still works on a handful of tunes , the band s precision enabled it to play at a whisper , with mr king playing quietly as well this provided him with a springboard to leap into a roar he is one of the last great blues shouters , and much of the time he does n't need a microphone to be heard , even when the band is at full power he faced off against the threepiece horn section , alternating intense guitar phrases with the riffs of the horns as if he were preaching to the choir he was casual , apparently enjoying the intimacy of a club and the full house , clearly understanding how lucky it was to be in the presence of a master , gave him a standing ovation mr king and his band are at the blue note through sunday photo b b king at the blue note on tuesday , from three perspectiveswith playfulness and delight , he put decades of feeling and skill on display \( photographs by steve berman \)
philadelphia steven grasse , who at 31 sits precariously on the edge of the demographic group known as generation x , rather likes the stereotypes that paint the group as a listless and cynical group of losers those stereotypes , said mr grasse , who runs the advertising agency gyro worldwide here , have made me a wealthy man indeed , mr grasse , who declined to divulge his salary , has built an entire business out of marketing to a group of consumers that has eluded marketers for almost a decade but none of the stereotypes fits the group easily sure , many are too young and underemployed to afford the cappuccino makers and infiniti cars that lure their babyboomer elders yet they are too old and overemployed to buy the polyester clothes hawked to the youngsters behind them many others , however , are young careerists , devoted to work and socking away money in taxsheltered 401 \( k \) retirement accounts after seeing parents or older siblings downsized out of jobs this generation s spending power may be 80 percent of what baby boomers' was at those age levels and their priorities are so much different , said britt beemer , chairman of america s research group , a market research firm in charleston , sc , speaking of the 48 million baby busters born in this country between 1964 and 1977 if anyone thinks they have no buying power , they have no idea of this generation , he added they are savvy at a younger age , they drive about 30 percent of computer sales , they have had some of the most major impact on book superstores and they singlehandedly destroyed the mallbased music stores by buying in freestanding stores so the issue was never whether to market to them , but what to market to them and how mr grasse believes he has the answers to both questions first , create an aura of coolness at his agency by decorating it like a dorm room , complete with tasteless jokes taped to the toilet in the unkempt bathroom second , know your audience generation x will buy cigarettes and alcohol , as well as clothes and music clients from those businesses pay the agency between 20 , 000 and 50 , 000 to sell their name to a twentysomething audience gyro s accounts include the r j reynolds tobacco company , a unit of rjr nabisco holdings , for its red kamel brand the paddington corporation , which sells several brands of alcoholic beverages , and reactor , a clothing company the theory behind the agency , founded by mr grasse and his wife , emma , six years ago , is that people in their 20 s understand how to sell beer , cigarettes , jeans and music to each other better than the standardbearers on madison avenue although he is extremely secretive about his business , mr grasse says gyro has grown at about a 20 percent clip over the last few years his strategy is not to seem youthful the aim is to be hip traditional advertising sometimes does not work with twentysomethings excessive exposure to gladhanding salesmanship early in life , the theory goes , has made them less susceptible hence the rise of pitchmen with attitudes , like charles barkley and andre agassi selling nike shoes and sportswear in the campaigns of wieden kennedy in portland , ore , and mcdonald s nothing but net basketballoriented campaign , by the leo burnett company in chicago , which traded on its own transcendent fakery the founders of gyro , one of several new agencies managed by people in their 20 s that market to their peers , felt they could do better other agencies include the collegiate marketing company , a market consulting group in radnor , pa , and tattoo inc in san francisco most of the rest of twentysomething marketing is done by specialized divisions within larger , established agencies our agency is about a cool , hip sensibility , mr grasse said iggy pop is as cool as he was in the 60 s david bowie , the same they have their finger on what is going on a lot of people just stop being plugged in when they get older the life cycle of hipness is short and most people get onto things when it is way too late , mr grasse added that life cycle goes from obscure to cutting edge to mainstream to out you want your brand to transcend that cycle part of how that is done , he said , is by constantly changing a product s advertising so that it reflects new trends , rather than planning a year s worth of campaigns too far ahead of time also , the agency tries to build a brand s image , rather than focusing on the product , and that image tends to be one of a hipster cool guy who just happens to be using the product that is advertised gyro , however , is best known in the industry not for its list of roughly 16 clients , but for ads that have caused a stir and caused the agency to be dismissed by other clients in 1993 , gyro proposed a campaign for a local clothing merchant , zipper head , that featured a picture of charles manson and the tag line , everyone has the occasional urge to go wild and do something completely outrageous other clients , like the comcast corporation , a cable television and cellular phone company , and a local record store were not amused by gyro s idea , and dismissed the agency i was terrified , mr grasse said i thought my business was through instead , it had just begun the controversy caught the attention of viacom s mtv , which hired the agency to do some work , as did r j reynolds and cocacola
jonesboro , ga , july 28 now we know what a beach volleyball star wears to an olympic medal ceremony a red , white and blue warmup suit , a pink cap and bare feet karch kiraly stood on the podium again today , only this time there were flecks of sand clinging to his toes and eight more years of digs , spikes , cuts and sets clinging to his memory as he stared at the american flag rising before him otherwise , it could have been los angeles or seoul there in the stands was his family , including his lean and proud father , las , the hungarian immigrant who tearfully waved the flag of his adopted nation there around kiraly s neck was a third olympic gold medal the most ever won by a men s volleyball player kiraly s first two golds came indoors in 1984 and 1988 , when he helped lead the american team to the top of a sport long dominated by eastern europeans today s gold came with his partner , kent steffes , on the beach , or , to be more accurate , a rainswept , sandfilled pit laid down next to an artificial lake in suburban atlanta the nearest real beach was more than a threehour drive away in savannah , but that was somehow appropriate because professional beach volleyball has proved resolutely flexible in its sunblockslathered push to prominence tournaments have been played in landlocked states they have been played in the dead of winter in arenas in paris and now for the first time , the sport s practitioners can say they have played in the olympics this was an awesome feeling , kiraly said what i am most proud of is that i was able to win gold medals in both forms of volleyball kiraly , 35 , and steffes , 28 , were never in serious danger of losing to their fellow californians michael dodd and mike whitmarsh before the match , none of them could remember precisely how many times they had met , but all agreed that kiraly and steffes had won a large majority of the matches and when today s 125 , 128 victory ended with steffes blocking whitmarsh , there was no surprise , no rancor what can you say \? dodd asked losing to karch kiraly is nothing to go home ashamed about steffes also played a vital role with his big jumpserving , big hitting and sparkling defense , and it was defense that made the difference after dodd and whitmarsh evened the second set at 55 kiraly and steffes would end up winning the next 4 points , the most memorable coming at 85 when kiraly managed to get a piece of a whitmarsh spike with his left arm the ball sailed beyond the end line steffes lunged and threw up a desperation , longrange underhand set that turned out to be perfectly placed kiraly smashed it away for perhaps the easiest of his 17 kills there was more to this match than athleticism , however it was also charged with symbolism despite being a relatively new sport , beach volleyball already has two competing tours the avp \( association of volleyball professionals \) , based in the united states and the fivb tour run by the sport s international governing body , which is based in lausanne , switzerland kiraly and steffes , like dodd and whitmarsh , play on the avp tour but the fivb set the rules and format for the olympics , and its president , ruben acosta , mandated that only two of the three american teams could be chosen at the olympic trials the other representative would be the topranked american team on the fivb tour , which turned out to be carl henkel and the 39yearold sinjin smith , a former beach legend no longer at his peak this did not sit well with the avp tour , where nearly all the top americans earn an increasingly good living nor did the fact that the ball , court dimensions and setting rules chosen for the olympics all differed from avp norms with kiraly acting as a spokesman , there were threats of a boycott of the trials , but those threats never materialized and after kiraly and steffes barely beat smith and henkel in the fourth round here , the allamerican olympic final turned out to be an allavp final , as well acosta was still on hand to shake hands with the winners and runnersup at the medal ceremony this was a chance to show that we have the best players in the world as we have said all along , kiraly said it was also significant that kiraly s 61yearold father , las , was in jonesboro to see it because of his anger with the fivb s rules , las had refused to come to the olympics but on saturday afternoon , after kiraly and steffes advanced to the final , kiraly called las at home in santa barbara , calif , and told him he had booked a seat for him on the redeye to atlanta he also told him explicitly that he wanted him to come that was the first time he ever had done that , las kiraly said it was las who had introduced his son to volleyball at age 6 on a beach in santa barbara and then proudly watched him develop into both the premier player in the sport and an articulate spokesman for it the beach game was karch s first love , las said he played it until he was 14 and then left for all those years to play indoors this gold medal brings him full circle photo karch kiraly celebrating a point during the gold medalcompetition in beach volleyball kiraly and his teammate , kent steffes , went on win \( associated press \)

washington to mark the 75th anniversary of its opening in september 1921 , the phillips collection in washington has organized a kind of birthday party presiding over it is luncheon of the boating party by pierre auguste renoir , which the museum considers its single most important holding from the moment it was shown at the sixth impressionist exhibition in paris in 1881 , just after it was finished , this big painting was accepted by almost everyone as an image of unalloyed happiness bought for the phillips collection in 1923 , it soon became one of the bestloved paintings in the united states blessed with a vast and contagious conviviality , it portrays a completely harmonious world pain and selfdoubt play no part in it , nor do cruelty and rejection nobody fights for center stage even midge and mosquito have taken the day off just for an hour or two , an earthly paradise has been set up in a little restaurant , la maison fournaise , on the banks of the seine , in chatou , not an hour s journey from paris what renoir had in mind was a charismatic tumble of images and impressions that would fall into place as a classless who s who of people known to him he put in the son and daughter of the owner of the restaurant he also put in gustave caillebotte , the millionaire painter and amateur oarsman who was to bequeath many great impressionist paintings to france then there is ellen andree , an actress and artist s model favored by degas , manet and renoir there is baron raoul barbier , the son of a former french ambassador to constantinople he himself had been mayor of saigon during the french occupation of vietnam there is renoir s future wife , aline charigot , caressing her little dog way in back we can see charles ephrussi , a silkhatted banker who doubled as connoisseur and critic the young man in a cap , next to ephrussi , may be his private secretary , the young poet jules laforgue who later influenced t s eliot in the upper far right , there is a hugely admired young actress called jeanne samary it is doubtless in character that she is being wooed by two handsome young men and closes her ears to both of them people have always fallen in love with this painting , but none more decisively than duncan phillips and his wife , marjorie a great parisian dealer , paul durandruel , had owned it almost uninterruptedly since it was painted when the phillipses went to lunch with paul s son , joseph , at his house in paris in the summer of 1923 , the renoir happened to be hanging on the wall in front of them lightning struck duncan phillips always liked to buy spontaneously neither he nor marjorie could resist what she later called that fabulous , incredibly entrancing , utterly alive and beguiling renoir masterpiece phillips wrote home to washington he had bought a masterpiece that was finer than any rubens as fine as any titian or giorgione its fame is tremendous , and people will travel thousands of miles to our house to see it it cost real money around 125 , 000 \( roughly 115 million in today s dollars \) but as the heir to a steel fortune , phillips could afford it besides , he was eager to strengthen the collection , already holding 240 paintings and open to the public in the family mansion near dupont circle the 59 loans that make up impressionists on the seine , on view through feb 9 , all relate directly or indirectly either to the boating party itself or to life as it was lived on , or by , the seine in the 1870 s and 80 s for its big birthdays , the phillips can count on the affection of museums worldwide for the present show , loans have come not only from the united states but from museums in england , france , the netherlands , switzerland , denmark , sweden , germany and austria the loans start with outright masterpieces like manet s boating from the metropolitan , monet s on the bank of the seine , bennecourt from the art institute of chicago , and two paintings of the bathing place called la grenouilliere , not far from chatou , that were painted by monet and renoir , working side by side in 1869 other paintings , like sisley s understated and almost arcadian factory on the banks of the seine near bougival of 1873 , lent from ordrupgaard in copenhagen , steal upon us like angelic afterthoughts of which the history of art has yet to take due account the sterling and francine clark art institute in williamstown , mass , known for its large renoir holdings , has sent a selfportrait from around 1875 a portrait of alphonse fournaise , the owner of the restaurant in which the luncheon takes place , and a portrait of the actress jeanne samary in her more than comfortable dressing room at the comedie francaise the phillips recently examined luncheon of the boating party by xray and infrared reflectogram and found that renoir , in painting it , had wrestled with problems almost beyond number every figure needed readjustment , often many times our glimpse of the river , the sailboats and the railroad bridge was radically transformed even the role of the scalloped canopy was thought and rethought hats were turned this way and that , and meaningful glances redirected men and women came down from paris to pose , gave up and went home halfway through , and left renoir to clean up the mess not a glass , a spoon or a fork was immune from alteration and so , as is usual in major art , nothing was quite true , but in the end everything was quite right the fournaise is now restored and back in business in chatou , with a small museum to go with it the view may no longer be quite as idyllic , nor the company so engaging but you can sit where renoir sat and remember guy de maupassant , who wrote about the fournaise , and matisse , derain and vlaminck , who , about 25 years later , made chatou famous all over again when they worked there and set color free in their fauve paintings photos luncheon of the boating party by pierre auguste renoir ,

madrid , march 5 jose maria aznar may sound dull and nasal to many spaniards , but in a crisis he knows how to keep his head last april , 40 pounds of explosives intended for the conservative leader blew up just yards short of his bulletproof car mr aznar climbed from the wreck largely unscathed , brushed off his clothes and walked to a nearby hospital on sunday he was tested again when he lived up to his pledge to run spain s longtime prime minister , felipe gonzalez , out of office but when the final results were in , instead of celebrating a sweeping victory , mr aznar , a former tax inspector from madrid , found himself caught in a labyrinth the narrow conservative victory has disappointed many aznar supporters and elated the socialists , who had feared a more humiliating defeat in the end , mr aznar got 388 percent of the vote , only 14 percent more than mr gonzalez , a difference of 340 , 000 of the more than 25 million votes cast on television and in news conferences , mr gonzalez has been beaming like the winner , and mr aznar has looked despondent never has a defeat been so sweet , and never has a victory been so bitter , a smiling mr gonzalez said today twenty seats short of a parliamentary majority , mr aznar , leader of the popular party , will have to stoop and make deals with heads of other , smaller parties none are people whom mr aznar is known to admire some he has scorned openly typically , mr aznar has seemed unperturbed announcing that he had won , he said that the country has begun a new chapter in its history spain s political shift to the right is indeed a major turnabout after 13 years under socialist rule but asked how mr aznar was feeling , one of his aides said he is fine he s in a fine mess in private , his aides concede that spain s new era may bring much bickering and possible instability when cartoonists have portrayed spain s two principal politicians , they have drawn the socialist mr gonzalez , a somewhat pudgy but seductive orator from seville , as a snake charmer mr aznar , a slightly built castilian and an awkward speaker , has been depicted as a marionette yet what binds these two very different men now is their dependence on the same wellknown spanish political figure , a catalan for the past 30 months , while mr gonzalez was leading a minority government , he was beholden to jordi pujol , president of the catalan regional government , whose party had the votes he needed in parliament now it is mr aznar s turn to depend on the catalan s 16 seats to form a government even then he may have to turn to the canary islands or another small regional group mr pujol , a former banker , is said to savor the role of kingmaker but so far his answer to mr aznar has been no in the way stands what friends call the forthright manner of mr aznar and critics describe as his lack of political savvy for the past 30 months he has been unrelenting in his criticism of mr pujol s support of the gonzalez government he has been attacking us for the past three years , said pere esteve , a catalan political leader this cannot be fixed in two days the only thing that has changed since march 3 is that they have stopped insulting us begging for support and having to make concessions is hard for a man as proud as mr aznar , according to his friends he takes pride in his own tenacious efforts to bring young people into the party and pull it away from the far right his friends have often heard him say that he has never asked anyone for favors , so he is not indebted to anyone miguel angel rodriguez , his press chief , said that his independence helped him survive when mr aznar took over the rightwing popular alliance in 1989 and renamed it the popular party , he got a telephone call from a senior member of the roman catholic church hierarchy , asking him , as a catholic politician , to issue a public statement against abortion his reply was , 'i shall , if you will seek votes for the popular party in the sunday mass , ' mr rodriguez said even on the eve of the elections , mr aznar was reported to have not made any cabinet preparations he has never promised anyone anything , said one of his collaborators , except his wife when he married her mr aznar spends his spare time largely with his wife , ana botella , a lawyer like him , and their three children he also plays a weekly game of paddle tennis with his friend pedro ramirez , the editor of the conservative daily newspaper el mundo , which has dug up most of the corruption and political scandals involving the gonzalez administration one question often asked here is why the solemn and stiff mr aznar has a large following among women he is not the classic spanish macho and he has a lot of integrity , said cristina loring , member of a prominent madrid publishing family amalia gomez , a member of parliament from mr aznar s party , said as a woman , i feel very good in this party he has promoted many women he believes in equality mr aznar , 43 , was born in madrid and comes from a family of conservative political journalists a grandfather of mr aznar was an important chronicler of franco s side in the civil war and both his grandfather and his father held government jobs during the franco dictatorship this family history may be one reason why mr aznar insists so often that his conservatism is modern , close to the center , with no links to the dark demons of spain s fascist past on the eve of the elections , mr aznar was asked on nationwide television if it was true that there was a whole jurassic park of old , hardline rightists hiding behind him , waiting to jump out after the elections mr aznar , not finding this funny , replied solemnly , in spain the far right no longer exists photo his reputation for being uncompromising helped jose maria aznar , the popular party , to oust prime minister felipe gonzalez , but the same trait is a disadvantage as the conservative leader seeks coalition partners \( agence francepresse \)
washington , june 11 bob dole today ended more than a decade as a senate republican leader , his tenure notable for deep commitment to the sometimes conflicting goals of deficit reduction , his party and the senate itself no republican before him matched his 11 years 5 months as leader in the majority , the minority and the majority again his years in s230 , a grand suite of capitol offices looking down the mall toward the washington monument , were marked by a dayin , dayout dedication to the job , with but two major distractions his losing bid for the 1988 republican presidential nomination and the campaign this year when success prompted his retirement in his farewell speech , he caught the nature of the senate that it functions at all only when at least some members of the two parties work together and are willing to deal all the parliamentary skills in the world cannot break filibusters as he recalled accomplishments from social security financing to the americans with disabilities act , he named 19 democratic senators he worked with and just 11 republicans he warned against the idea that we 've got to have total victory instead he quoted ronald reagan as willing to settle for 90 percent a share much bigger than a dealer like mr dole would often settle for the obligation to party , which mr dole did not dwell on today , has been a competing interest as it was when he abandoned a commitment to universal health care in 1994 he fought not only to president clinton s plan , but to the less sweeping , bipartisan efforts led by senator john chafee , the rhode island republican he had put in charge of republican health efforts democrats said he had sold out his own beliefs in pursuit of a presidential nomination and deficit reduction , which he cited today as what he wanted historians to remember , may sound like republican orthodoxy but it also produced conflicts , because he often felt that the way to achieve it included a concept that is anathema to many fellow republicans raising taxes in recent years , the job of leading the increasingly conservative republican senate contingent has reduced the occasions when mr dole could rise above party but last fall he backed president clinton s dispatch of troops to bosnia , supporting a commander in chief s authority while doubting his judgment among senate republicans , he faced opposition for office only the first time he ran for leader , in 1984 small groups of republicans to his right or his left occasionally grumbled about where he was leading the party , but none ran against him three traits helped him succeed in an era when a leader commands no real authority over the independent contractors who have reached the senate on their own he displayed a persistent skill at listening senator alan k simpson of wyoming , his deputy leader for 10 years , said recently , bob is a guy that can listen literally to three or four conversations at once mr simpson added that mr dole never used threats and almost never became angry warren b rudman , the former new hampshire senator , and mr chafee both praised him for never using profanity he knew his colleagues nick calio , a lobbyist for both the bush white house and for private industries , said he has a very strong sense of when he could push and when he should not push in most cases , people thought they reached a conclusion on their own he could break tension with humor though his jokes today focused on the brevity of mike mansfield and the loquaciousness of hubert humphrey and strom thurmond \( cited for a 24hour , 18minute filibuster , whose target , the 1957 civil rights bill , went unmentioned \) , many of his jokes among colleagues were selfdeprecating senators prefer that kind of humor to jokes aimed at themselves a leader s task is to forge consensus , first of all within his own party budget deals always demanded that effort , none more so than last year s balanced budget proposal he hammered out a gop consensus on welfare that brought most senate democrats along in 1991 he balanced the demands of the bush administration and moderates to facilitate agreement on civil rights that inclination blurs perceptions of mr dole s own beliefs sheila burke , his longtime chief of staff , said , he has subordinated his own views at times when his colleagues felt strongly another way of looking at that duty of leadership was offered by john c danforth , the fomer missouri senator who nominated him for leader in 1985 the republican leader in the senate is the leader of a constituency , namely his party members in the senate , mr danforth said , and over the years that constituency became increasingly ideological and narrow and combative , and those were the pressures on bob as a member of a moderate older school of republicans , mr danforth said , i was a problem the health care battle of 1994 put this problem in stark relief , especially in the view of democrats who fought for universal coverage former senator george j mitchell of maine , the democratic floor leader with whom mr dole got along best , said that mr dole s shift was profoundly disappointing senator john d rockefeller 3d , democrat of west virginia said dole took a walk on health care the taking of a walk was a cynical act and senator christopher j dodd of connecticut , national chairman of the democratic party , said that once mr dole decided he wanted to run for president he clearly subjugated his own beliefs on a number of issues including health care when the generally effusive mr chafee was asked his view of his leader s handling of health care , he said , i do n't want to get into that mr dole s frequent democratic admirer , senator daniel patrick moynihan of new york , said mr dole did not walk away from the issue , the clinton administration ignored him that was ms burke s interpretation , too she said , i think dole was prepared and anxious and willing and open to conversation but , she said , the administration was n't dealing in good faith she said mr dole abandoned the chafee bill , which sought universal coverage by requiring individuals to buy health insurance because we could n't hold our own people together in the end , the bill s failure was a major impetus for the republican gains that made mr dole majority leader again in 1995 criticized by many house republicans , he fought to get their agenda through the balky senate the record is one of few laws but many issues painting a bright line between him and mr clinton once he became the apparent presidential nominee this spring , democrats used against him the same obstructionist tactics he skillfully used to thwart them in 1992 he found himself battling not mr clinton , but senator tom daschle of south dakota , the minority leader , who fought him to a draw

east moriches , li , july 26 the hightechnology team running the undersea search at the crash site of twa flight 800 has previously explored sunken jumbo jets in the stormy waters off the irish coast and 15 , 000 feet beneath the surface of the indian ocean sweeping the emptiness of crushing depths , sitting for days in darkened control rooms far from shore , they are at home and have always found their tragic quarry just nine miles south of the hamptons , they have been effective , as well , but here they have encountered problems never faced far at sea with the shore lined with politicians and reporters , and distraught relatives of victims a bus ride away , the navy search and salvage team has faced intense pressure to achieve quick success even though most of its work must be done in a methodical , precise fashion that is the antithesis of haste weathering the pressure , several team members say , has been almost as difficult as enduring roundtheclock sessions of staring at shadowy sonar maps for clues , nudging robot vehicles around wreckage by tweaking computer joysticks , and then deploying divers to collect bodies and bits of evidence i 've never seen it so bad , said one technical expert , referring to the pressure on the searchers like most searchers , he spoke only on the condition of anonymity people not familiar with underwater operations do n't appreciate the difficulty of doing even simple things , said the searcher , a veteran of quests for debris from the challenger space shuttle and many offshore plane crashes on land you can drive 90 miles per hour , he said underwater , you can go three knots , essentially a walking pace and that s that despite the challenges , the search effort here has been achieving remarkable successes , with two navy divers following sonar maps finding the jet s data and voice recorders wednesday night , exactly one week after the plane crashed and by late today , the bodies of 140 of the 230 people aboard the plane had been recovered with a mosaic of sonar images of the 12squaremile heart of the crash site almost complete , the navy ordered a new laser device that transmits a detailed , liveaction image of the sea floor it was expected to begin operation at dawn on saturday unlike the sonar systems , which generate sketchy maps requiring careful analysis by trained specialists , the laser creates a simple , televisionlike image , said craig t mullen , an underwater search expert from oceaneering international , a private company under contract to the navy that operates the sensors and robots being used in the search several people on the search team said today they were relieved that with the discovery of the socalled black boxes and the accelerating retrieval of human remains the operation was settling into some semblance of a routine on the salvage vessel grasp , a halfdozen pilots for one of the remotecontrolled vehicles have been rotating through 12hour shifts , staring at grainy video monitors and using tiny motions of a joystick to propel the stovesize device in and around the wreckage a similar robot is roving beneath the pirouette , a chartered vessel carrying the sonar scanner , but not operating as a base for divers for many of the divers , robot operators and sonar experts offshore , the drill is familiar most have worked together on such searches since the 1980 s , with oceaneering involved in investigations of the 1985 bombing of an air india boeing 747 off the coast of ireland and the 1987 crash of a south african airways 747 in the indian ocean near the island of mauritius those , like most plane crashes at sea , occurred in milesdeep water in responding to the twa crash , the tightly knit crew of navy salvage experts and contract engineers and experts was suddenly faced with an unfamiliar challenge the search coordinators accustomed to working alone quickly had to learn the art of crash diplomacy , finding ways to use dozens of divers offered by just about every nearby police or rescue agency with a set of scuba tanks the navy search team could not be seen turning away assistance , even though many of the local divers lacked the specialized gear and experience to handle search and salvage work in 100 to 140 feet of water , depths that pose significant safety and health risks to divers using conventional scuba gear the navy divers drawn from a range of specially trained teams and coordinated by the navy office of the supervisor of salvage breathe pressurized air pumped from the surface to helmets , allowing long stays on the bottom their gloves , made of the same kevlar fabric used in bulletproof vests , allow them to grapple with shredded sheet metal without risk of injury dozens of divers from the new york state police and the police and fire departments of new york city and nassau and suffolk counties were on the scene starting on the night of the crash search coordinators found ways to put many of the divers to work , despite the limitations of standard scuba gear , which prevented them from staying on the bottom for more than 15 minutes at a time from what i 've seen here , the navy has done a superb job of getting everyone to pull together and be productive , said mr mullen , whose company has a separate division providing divers for the navy , none of whom were employed in this search but starting early in the week , the navy gently , but steadily , shifted the local divers to the margins of the operation , according to several people familiar with the search in the meantime , the navy was bolstering its own ranks , calling in 18 additional divers expected this weekend by thursday , divers from other agencies were doing little other than shuttling the bodies of victims to the surface , said rear adm edward k kristensen , the top navy official on the scene and by this evening , the operation was almost back to the conditions under which the search and salvage team prefers to work silent and steady , like the floor of the sea itself photo robert francis , vice chairman of the national transportationsafety board , wearing an fbi jacket , talked to the divers

andorra by peter cameron 263 pp new york farrar , straus giroux 23 andorra has been lucky in its writers or , to be more precise , lucky in the writers who have seen this small , landlocked country , tucked high away in the pyrenees , through the prism of their own invention the english novelist rose macaulay created her andorra in the 1920 s the swiss writer max frisch presented his in the early 1960 s now , in his wonderful third novel , peter cameron both invokes this tradition and extends it many years ago , his narrator begins , i read a book that was set in andorra a preliminary account , a kind of blueprint for this enterprise , can be found in mr cameron s previous novel , the weekend , in which a character proposes to write a travel book about an imaginary 19thcentury country free of cars but blessed with the anachronisms of electricity and plumbing the real point of this imaginary country , however , is not simply to flee technology but to seek refuge from grief and trouble initially , andorra seems like just such a place to the wealthy american protagonist of mr cameron s new novel although there are hints of alexander fox s predicament from the opening paragraph \( i left behind all that i needed to leave behind which is to say everything \) , his first impression of andorra , when he gets off the night train from paris , is of a sunny and welcoming place at the excelsior , the only hotel in the town of la plata , he is given a beautiful turret room overlooking the plaza he sets out for lunch and stops to buy a diary later that afternoon , in ink thick and permeable as blood , he begins to write the story we are reading at the restaurant , he meets the friendly mrs ricky dent and her large dog it soon becomes clear that this imaginary country has two major characteristics it is populated by a very small number of people , almost all of whom seem unnervingly interested in the new arrival and everyone is remarkably polite mr cameron uses epigraphs from proust and austen , among others , and it would be hard to find two more fitting gatekeepers for this wellmannered place , where the narrator , even at a moment of declaring his affections , refers to their object as miss quay it is a sign of true desperation when , in chapter 16 , a character finally uses a fourletter word except for these anomalies , the world of andorra is largely naturalistic characters eat , drink , profess love and lust , apply suntan lotion , move briskly from one place to another there is none of the dreaminess that permeates , for example , the imaginary country of kazuo ishiguro s novel the unconsoled once the logic of mr cameron s invented andorra is established , it is almost ruthlessly maintained and how should we understand the relationship between this andorra and real life \? a possible description is offered when mrs dent and alex attend the ballet at first , the antics of the dancers strike alex as inane , but slowly , as he watches mrs dent watching , it comes to him that ballet works not by counterfeiting the world we know but by showing us a world better than , different from , revelatory of , our own another characteristic of this different world is the swiftness with which events and relationships develop after lunch on his first day in la plata , alex returns to the hotel , where he meets mrs reinhardt she in turn introduces him to the redoubtable mrs sophonsobia quay and her two daughters the quiet , unwed jean and the lively , muchmarried nancy mrs quay rents alex her brotherinlaw s house and he proceeds to fall in love , not entirely convincingly , first with mrs dent and then with miss jean quay he is also the object of mr dent s attentions these events are plotted with some of the comic verve that informed mr cameron s first novel , leap year , but in spite of many humorous touches the bizarre names , for example , and the lavish use of coincidence that verve is now unmistakably harnessed to a darker purpose the morning alex arrives in andorra , the body of a young man is found in the harbor soon it emerges that several of the seemingly carefree inhabitants of la plata are , like alex , refugees from loss and sorrow gradually , inexorably , as we follow alex through his uneasy and entertaining entanglements with the dents and the quays , his own dark past is revealed since this revelation comes almost entirely from alex himself , it is essential that we believe not only in his intelligence but also in his talent for selfdeception in both these respects , he is well served by mr cameron s carefully calibrated prose here , for example , is alex describing his room after a brief visit from mrs dent the curtains still fluttered at the window , but the light had altered , dimmed a bit , for the apex of the afternoon had been achieved and relinquished , and in that relinquishment i sensed a larger , more permanent abandonment i felt very keenly the inherent sadness of late afternoon the beauty of this voice , combined with its modulation , goes a long way to make credible alex s repression and , as we discover , his capacity for violence like so many good novels , andorra ends badly for the characters but well for the reader mr cameron steers us through the final , fantastical events of alex s story with an unfaltering hand in the real world , we might pause to question the rapid denouement in the world of andorra , we know better drawing \( patrick chappatte \) no more
in what one scientist called a tour de force , a group of researchers in sweden has succeeded for the first time in growing nerve cells across gaps in severed spinal cords in rats the work is startling and demands to be repeated by others , said experts in the field , who noted that some previous reports of similar achievements had failed to pan out it is merely the first step toward the distant goal of curing patients with injured spinal cords , they said , but the work shows that such a goal may not be an impossible dream the study , by dr lars olson , a professor of neurobiology dr henrich cheng , a neurosurgeon and dr yihai cao , a molecular biologist , at the karolinska institute in sweden , is being published today in the journal science it involved adult rats whose spinal cords were severed , leaving a gap of about onefifth of an inch using microsurgery , dr cheng sewed a bridge of slender nerve cells across the gap , to guide the severed nerves in their effort to regenerate he obtained the nerves for the bridge from the animals' chests the investigators glued the bridge down at either end with fibrin , the sticky substance in blood that shows up on a wound just before a scab forms they had first mixed the fibrin with fibroblast growth factor , a substance that encourages cells to grow then they watched for three months while the injured animals dragged their hind legs behind them , like dead weights finally , dr olson said , he noticed a change in the animals that had gotten the complete repair treatment , but not in control animals that had had no surgery or only parts of it the treated animals , he said , started to flex their legs dr olson , who had been working on spinal cord repair for almost three decades , said , that was one of the best moments in my scientific life as time went by , he said , the rats continued to improve they started to move their hind limbs , as if they were attempting to use them for walking , dr olson said a year after the surgery , the treated animals could partly support their weight and could move their legs , although they were not walking normally when the researchers did anatomical studies , injecting dyes into the nerve tracts after the rats had been killed , they found that nerves had regrown from either end of the injury , growing down to the tail and up to the brain dr jerry silver , a professor of neuroscience at case western reserve university in cleveland , said he was taken aback by the results in cutting away a large section of the rats' spinal cords , dr silver said , they 've done about the worst thing to a spinal cord that you can do the model is rather dramatic , he said they 've duplicated the worst thing possible and then some and then , dr silver said , the investigators did what many thought was impossible they got the nerves to regenerate across the gap and to function again i think it s pretty incredible , dr silver said dr wise young , a professor of neurosurgery , physiology and neuroscience at new york university , who wrote an accompanying editorial in science , was also impressed i think this paper shows not only that regeneration is possible but it also shows that the task will be easier than we ever anticipated , dr young said probably very few axons crossed the gap , probably no more than 10 percent and that means , he said , that we do n't have to regrow the whole spinal cord it means that repairing spinal cord injury is in the realm of possibility the field of spinal cord regeneration has been plagued by reports of miraculous cures of animals whose cords were severed and who subsequently walked and even scampered about none of those reports panned out the first thing about spinal cord research is to be very , very skeptical about it , said dr john w commissiong , a neurobiologist at the national institute of neurological diseases and stroke in many previous reports of cures , dr commissiong said , investigators did not even sever the animals' spinal cords , although they thought they had done so in general , you do n't see what you are doing because there is an enormous amount of bleeding , he said and when researchers accidentally left just 5 percent of nerve fibers intact , he said , after six months , the rats walked normally as researchers became more sophisticated in their methods , the claims of healed spinal cords all but ceased , said dr paul reier , a professor of neurosurgery and neuroscience at the university of florida college of medicine in gainesville , and the task of regenerating severed spinal cord nerves began to look nearly hopeless dr young said that the work was so discouraging that there may be just 20 labs in the us working on spinal cord injury , compared to aids where there are literally thousands of labs working on the problem a crucial factor in his success , dr olson said , was that his group purposely guided nerve cells to grow from white matter , the outer , insulated layer of the spinal cord , to gray matter , the interior part of the cord normally , nerve cells grow on the outside of the spinal cord that s their highway , dr silver said when nerves branch off to connect with a muscle , for example , they veer into the gray matter and then out of the spinal cord but white matter contains inhibitors that stymie nerve growth , researchers have found by constructing the nerve bridges so they went from white matter to gray matter , the researchers apparently bypassed the nerve growth inhibitors the regenerating nerves grew across the gap in the spinal cord , entered the gray matter on the other side , and migrated down the cord at the interface between the white matter and the gray matter that tells us that the white matter inhibitors that are thought to be all over the spinal cord are not so inhibitory after all , dr silver said dr silver said that what surprised him most about that work is that it was so simple we 're in an age of molecular biology , and they used just a simple surgical procedure to make a bridge and then bolted it down with glue , he said but dr reier said that the very simplicity of the work made him a little leery if this is true , we 've been missing the point for years , he said it s not like the result here is built on a huge degree of biotech what it is is a surgical tour de force and so , dr reier said , it is crucial that the work be replicated by other laboratories if this is absolutely true , it s remarkable , he said this work is coming from a good laboratory , but they 're talking about a degree of regeneration that is pretty remarkable and getting fibers to grow across a lesion is pretty astounding then , to say the animal got some degree of function is even more astounding

if the new york philharmonic s concerts had not been planned and announced more than a year ago , a listener attending the subscription series that began on thursday evening might have concluded that kurt masur had chosen his program reactively , as a grandly scaled memorial jacob druckman , who was once the orchestra s composer in residence \( and was the father of one of its percussionists , daniel druckman \) , died last week , and three former members of the orchestra died during the season that ends with tonight s concert a program insert notes that the concerts are dedicated to mr druckman s memory , and mr masur remembered the musicians in brief comments from the stage in that context , the program though it included none of mr druckman s music had the spirit of a sober meditation before the intermission , lynn harrell was the cello soloist in ernest bloch s schelomo , a work inspired by king solomon s seemingly gloomy but ultimately hopeful observations in ecclesiastes the second half of the program was given over to the bruckner fourth symphony , with its elegiac andante and its waves of catharsis , not the least being the slow buildup that ends the work the bruckner s horn calls , hefty brass chorales and vividly colored wind and string lines make it one of the more manipulative works in the orchestral canon , and there were moments when one wished that mr masur had mined that quality more overtly but it would be unfair to say that he ignored it passages that seemed oddly static often proved to have been held back to make transitions or changes of texture more dramatic and one had to admire the deftness with which mr masur and his players moved between this work s extremes of muscularity and delicacy the philharmonic was generally at its best , and the occasional strand of wayward ensemble was quickly swept away by taut , wellbalanced playing and the brass , so crucial to this work but often this orchestra s weak link was uniformly superb the horn calls were gorgeously nuanced and perfectly tuned , and bruckner s grandiose scoring for full brass choir had a thrilling power and intensity the bloch demands orchestral brilliance as well , and mr masur and his players were fine collaborators with mr harrell , whose interestingly varied articulation gave the solo cello line the almost vocal quality demanded of it here as an encore , mr harrell gave a graceful account of the sarabande from bach s sixth suite for unaccompanied cello in memory of mr druckman
one of the six characters portrayed in brine county wedding , a stupefying exercise in tedium , is a waiter at a restaurant called the turkey tepee and that just about describes the whole show it is a source of frequent amazement what some people think will be funny to other people the concoction put together and performed by christopher v alessi and his director , henry polic 2d , at the wpa theater might bring a chuckle to a family picnic or a dinner party of the author s close friends , provided they all had enough to drink beforehand but to a theater audience of strangers , it is numbing the show s appeal will pretty much be limited to those who find watching haircuts or a trip to the post office among life s more scintillating experiences the point of departure for this particular conceit is , as the title suggests , a wedding that is to take place in brine county , alabama rather than build a play around the bride or her family or the usual vicissitudes that surround the event , mr alessi has decided to tell about it through monologues by the local postmaster , a hairdresser , a karaoke singer who is to perform at the reception , the waiter at the turkey tepee , a bridesmaid and the groom none of them has a good word to say about the bride , except the groom , who gushes over her and recalls how he fell in love with her the night she vomited on his college roommate s trousers it is not an uncommon failing of beginning playwrights to think that the idiosyncracies or plain stupidity of their characters are somehow humorous in themselves but when the postmaster explains to a customer for the third time that all his stamps , no matter their picture , all cost the same 32 cents , patience wears thin mr alessi plays all six characters , monotonously the hairdresser sounds just like the postmaster , who sounds just like the bridesmaid , who sounds just like the groom brine county wedding written and performed by christopher v alessi directed by henry polic 2d set by alistair wandesfordesmith lighting by jack mehler sound by kurt b kellenberger production stage manager , ruth e kramer presented by wpa , kyle renick , artistic director lori sherman , managing director at 519 west 23d street , chelsea
as matthew langmaid walked up third avenue yesterday morning , not one person asked him how the weather was up there not one per son called him treetop , or demanded to know whether he played professional basketball it was a nice feeling , he said , just to blend in blending in is not so easy when you stand 7 feet 3 , and you are , in fact , the tallest man in all of wales but mr langmaid was in the midst of a group of very tall tourists who had come to manhattan to share in a celebration of their stature during their stay , there have been glorious moments , all too rare for the tall , of conversations held eye to eye , of dances danced cheek to cheek beginning last week , the new york region has served as host to the annual convention of tall clubs international , a network of 167 clubs for tall people throughout the world , including 68 in the united states after a fourth of july week end spent in manhattan , the 200 conventioneers are heading tomorrow for kutsher s country club in the catskills for seminars , tips on where to shop and more dancing admission to any of these clubs , from the paramount tall club of chicago to the new jersey moon h rakers , rests solely on height in a world where the average woman stands 5 feet 3 , female applicants must be 5 feet 10 men , meanwhile , must exceed the average male height of 5 feet 9 by a full five inches , to 6 feet 2 a man otherwise proud of his 6feet stature may be distressed to learn that without those extra two inches , he is nothing more than , as club members like to say , a squeaker ann watt , the 5foot11 founder of the 200member tall club of new york city , says the growing success of the clubs hinges on a single element we are so comfortable with each other that ease could be found in a suite at a midtown hotel yesterday morning , where members gathered before a scheduled trip to ellis island anja knoerr , a 6foot5 marketing manager from germany , decided not to buy a tall club tshirt because , she said , the large size was n't large enough meanwhile , barry hanold , a 6foot3 computer consultant from northport , li , explained the perils that awaited visitors to the statue of liberty lone lines and low headroom although they varied in tallness , the conventioneers had similar experiences to share it is very difficult , for example , to find a bed in which to sleep comfortably \( mr langmaid s solution is to lay a piece of foam over a trunk placed at the end of his bed \) and squeezing into seats in public transportation usually leaves backs aching and knees bruised like many tall people , ed valin h tis , of florida , said he has particular trouble finding clothing for his 6foot7 frame , and often pays more than the average person for styles that are no longer in fashion if plaid is in style this year , he said , we 'll get it next year but the discomfort of the tall can also be traced to childhood , when selfesteem is a work in progress mr valintis has not forgotten the laughter that enveloped him when he banged his head while boarding a school bus and tom dawson , who is 6 feet 6 , rattled off just a sampling of the nicknames he had as a child shorty , treetop , stretch the awkwardness of being different extends into adulthood , they said they are always the tallest in the group they are always leaning forward to hear others speak , and they are always asked whether they have ever played professional basketball , so often for mr knoerr , in fact , that she now responds by asking questioners whether they play professional miniature golf helen bessette , a 5foot11 actress who lives in manhattan , said her defining moment came when a date repeatedly asked her , why are you wearing heels \? she said she went home , turned on her computer and scanned the internet with a search word tall that led her to the tall club , and to a higher level of selfesteem mr langmaid , the man casting the longest shadows in cardiff , said he too looks forward to the camaraderie at tall club functions my life revolves around it , he said among these people , jokes can be made about group portraits in which the tall stand in the front and the very tall stand in the back now and then they might dance to the randy newman song short people most of all , they just spend time with each other on thursday night , 50 tall club members walked down to the east river to watch the fourth of july fireworks , much to the dismay of people standing behind them a compromise was reached in which the tall and short rearranged themselves for unobstructed views on friday night , the conventioneers danced , yes , cheek , to cheek , at le bar bat until well after 2 am , which accounted for the tired looks on some of those who walked with mr langmaid up third avenue yesterday morning the tall people , more than two dozen of them , turned left onto 42d street , where they stopped to look skyward at the silvery grandeur of the chrysler building then they walked into grand central terminal and down to the lexington subway line as mr langmaid boarded the no 5 train , his head grazed the subway car ceiling but none of his friends seemed to notice
dave , the woman with a frail voice said over the telephone , i'm dying we 're all dying , althea , replied david dinkins to althea gibson althea gibson , the onetime tennis star , had made her remark evenly , the way she once handled a baseline rally dinkins , the former mayor of new york city , and a longtime friend of gibson s and a tennisplaying enthusiast , had responded recently with what he hoped was an offer of support and optimism but things do not appear bright for gibson , who at 67 years old has lost considerable weight and is said to be around 100 pounds , down from the 150 she weighed when she was the world s greatest female tennis player at 5 feet 11 inches , she played with power and grace to become the first black to win wimbledon \( 1957 and 1958 \) , and the first black to win a united states singles title , in 1958 none of my clothes fit anymore , she told dinkins gibson has what she has called a terminal disease , although she has not said publicly what it is she has had two strokes in recent years that , by several accounts , have limited her mobility as well as her memory she lives in a small house in east orange , nj , and moves quietly about it , rarely going to the basement recreational area where her many sports trophies and plaques are displayed she has been reclusive for the last few years , and is said to be nearly destitute she sees very few people because she does n't want anyone to see her the way she is now , said angela buxton , gibson s doubles partner when they won wimbledon in 1956 , who has remained a lifelong friend she wants to be remembered for the way she was buxton became gibson s doubles partner in an odd way , as she described it since althea was black , she was having a difficult time getting a doubles partner in america , said buxton , and since i was jewish , i was having a similar problem in england so we just hooked up and won ! gibson left the amateurs in 1958 and played professional tennis for a short period she tried professional golf for a time , then taught tennis until her illness when friends heard about her situation , they offered financial assistance but she was reluctant to accept it , dinkins said she s very private about herself but after awhile , she did accept help last weekend , there was a fundraiser in marin county , calif , which netted 25 , 000 for gibson on dec 7 , in los angeles , there will be another fundraiser , headed by her former gynecologist , william hayling she was a hero to so many of us , hayling said she was the jackie robinson of tennis , being first and doing it with so much pride and dignity but she was also not like jackie in that she never came out aggressive she had said i'm not a racially conscious person i do n't want to be i see myself as just an individual but others did n't while an early star in black tournaments , she was not allowed to play in uslta events in 1950 , alice marble , a former national champion , wrote a powerful letter that appeared in the american lawn tennis magazine challenging the uslta s racist attitude if tennis is a game for ladies and gentlemen , marble wrote , it s also time we acted a little more like gentle people and less like sanctimonious hypocrites it was the beginning of the end of segregated tournaments , as gibson was allowed to play forest hills for the first time and while gibson often seemed cool on and off the court , the discrimination surely took its toll over the years while only a handful of blacks have made it to the top level of tennis since gibson arthur ashe and zina garrisonjackson are the most prominent she remains a symbol for what can be right for america in tennis , in sports , in society at large after her united states title , she was presented with the trophy and offered , as allison danzig wrote in the new york times , an expression of hope that she might be able to wear her crown with dignity and humility her remarks were followed by the longest demonstration of handclapping heard in the stadium in years with the top female pros at madison square garden this week , there could be no finer way to remember althea gibson than to listen to the echoes of those cheers photo althea gibson \( the new york times , 1952 \)
in a sweeping effort to reduce its exposure to natural disasters , one of the nation s leading insurers plans to announce today that it will sharply curtail the sale of new homeowner policies in coastal areas along the hurricanevulnerable eastern seaboard and gulf of mexico , from maine to texas the decision by the nationwide insurance company , the fifthlargest insurer of homes in the country , would be the latest and most extensive retrenchment by insurance companies reeling from recent losses caused by hurricanes , earthquakes and other huge disasters it will virtually halt sales in florida until now , most insurance withdrawals were relatively circumscribed allstate and state farm , the country s two largest providers of homeowner insurance , have limited their sales in florida and california as well as parts of north and south carolina the farmer s insurance group , the thirdlargest home insurer , cut back sharply on sales in california after the 1993 earthquake in the los angeles area in recent years , several insurers reduced their coverage in particularly vulnerable areas on long island and other coastal areas of new york , new jersey and connecticut but none have taken action affecting as much territory as nationwide the company does not do business in new jersey and louisiana it does very little business in massachusetts and impact there will be slight , the company said for coastal dwellers in the east , reductions in the availability of insurance are leading to higher costs and , in many cases , sharply limited coverage comprehensive figures are not available , but several states have reported increases of up to 17 percent in the number of people who are being forced into insurance pools of last resort when they have been unable to obtain insurance through local agents the pools typically charge 20 to 25 percent more for policies that provide only barebones coverage for fire and major damage mary griffin , an insurance specialist in washington for consumers union , said it was unfair and troubling for companies to be reducing coverage in the most disasterprone sections of the country consumers need coverage for hurricanes , she said the propertycasualty companies are profitable businesses the whole purpose of insurance is diminished if they 're not providing coverage for the worst risks over all , the effect on homeowners outside the most vulnerable coastal areas varies from state to state , depending on different regulations and calculations of risk in new york , for example , the costs of most homeowner policies have not risen recently but in florida costs have soared by up to nearly 80 percent in the last three years disaster claims have been particularly heavy recently in the single most costly disaster so far , hurricane andrew cost insurance companies 155 billion after it tore through south florida four years ago , forcing several small insurers into bankruptcy two years ago , insurers paid 125 billion for losses in the los angeles earthquake and in the first nine months of this year alone , the industry has paid out 62 billion for damage from natural disasters , including hurricane bertha and hurricane fran richard d crabtree , the president and chief operating officer of nationwide , said the curtailment was crucial to protect the financial security of the company prudence requires us to diligently manage our exposure to catastrophic losses , he said robert a oakley , the company s chief financial officer , added , nationwide insurance possesses great financial strength and we intend to keep it that way mr crabtree said nationwide had been limiting sales quietly in the coastal areas for some time john millen , a spokesman for nationwide , said he could not quantify the reduction but he said it would occur from maine to texas , including washington in florida , he said , new sales will only take place when a previously held policy is dropped , so that no growth will take place mr millen said the company had 26 million policies in force , an increase of 800 , 000 since 1990 he said most of those covered homes east of the mississippi , but he said for competitive reasons the company would not say how many were in areas where sales were being curtailed michael walters , an actuary and principal of tillinghasttowers perrin , an insurance consulting firm , said he was surprised by the broad sweep of nationwide s action but he said it reflected the shock the industry had felt as catastrophic losses piled up a large part of the problem , he said , was not recalculating risk as years went by without major hurricanes and tens of thousands of new and more expensive homes went up along the coasts insurers were lulled into a false sense of security , he said they were writing business as usual then hurricane andrew came along the losses toppled 10 small companies outright and many very solid companies were rocked state farm , the largest insurer of homes in florida , with more than a million policies in force , reported losses of 37 billion allstate , which is the secondlargest insurer with about 900 , 000 policies , had losses of 23 billion since the fall of 1995 state farm has refused to write new policies in florida it has also limited sales in california , because of earthquake concerns , and in the carolinas and parts of louisiana and texas as one step in

riskier , several companies have sold off their homeowner s operations or simply stopped selling policies , as did geico , a company that had already been devoting most of its energies to automobile coverage , said jack weber , the executive director of the natural disaster coalition , a trade organization based in washington that has sought federal assistance for the industry even before nationwide s decision , mr weber said , he had been hearing from agents that the situation has been getting worse finding companies that will write policies in coastal areas , he said , is becoming

washington , april 4 the tip came the way the fbi had long expected , from a family member with misgivings but the search for the man investigators believe is the unabomber still had months to go before the suspect was arrested on wednesday , as his deeply torn family struggled with its loyalties and then as an elite team of agents stood vigil for weeks in the montana snows and even now the case is far from finished , postal inspectors and other lawenforcement officials said today with the arrest of theodore j kaczynski in montana , hundreds of agents , held back in recent weeks for fear of somehow tipping their hand to a fugitive who had eluded them for nearly 18 years , are now fanning out to airports , bus stations , homeless shelters and universities nationwide they are trying to fill the many blanks in the life of mr kaczynski , a harvardeducated recluse the tip that led to the arrest arrived in a similarly mysterious fashion , investigators said today when mr kaczynski s brother , david , of schenectady , ny , first approached the federal bureau of investigation early this year , his initial contact was through an intermediary as described by federal officials supervising the investigation , david kaczynski , who had also attended harvard and who in 1971 helped his brother buy the montana property , grew suspicious late last year that his brother might be the author of the unabomber s published 35 , 000word manifesto david kaczynski combed old family papers , finding what he feared might exist , copies of some letters dating to the 1970 s that were written by his brother to newspapers protesting the abuses of technology the sentiments were disturbingly reminiscent of what he thought he had read in the unabomber manuscript but it was not until january that a lawyer for the family telephoned the fbi in washington the lawyer was nervous , one official recalled the lawyer described the situation without revealing either brother s name or the basis of the suspicions the brother was nervous , the official added , wanting to protect and not to smear his brother s name if he was n't guilty and not to hurt him if he was what followed was a delicate dance of persuasion it took several more weeks to set up a meeting at an fbi office with the lawyer and david kaczynski , and just before they met , additional writings were turned over that seemed to solidify the connection still , the official said , the lawyer balked at identifying the letter writer or giving his whereabouts but agents , having established david kaczynski s identity and schooling during the meeting , then began checking the family s background we had kind of figured it out before he told us who his brother was , and that they both went to harvard , the official said officials said that they had no reason to believe that david kaczynski was in any way involved in any wrongdoing or that he was driven to come forward by the 1 million reward although , they added , he might be eligible to collect it finally , not only did the agents discover theodore kaczynski s mountain cabin , but also were able to persuade his mother , wanda , to authorize a further search of the family s house in lombard , ill , in midmarch as family members prepared to move out quickly then , postal investigators , fbi agents and explosive specialists , disguised as lumberjacks and other outdoorsmen , began slipping into helena , and the rural hamlet of lincoln , 50 miles northwest and not far from the cabin the agents began striking up conversations with local residents , hoping to learn more about the hermit in the cabin without tipping their hand at the same time , a pair of fbi snipers crept close to the cabin and staked it out for weeks , communicating with their commanders by encrypted radios they watched as mr kaczynski sometimes emerged to tend his garden and retrieve provisions from his root cellar but he never left his property on wednesday , 40 agents ended the surveillance , converging on his cabin with a search warrant with them was an army ordnance team , assigned to search for any booby traps , but none were found the officials said that mr kaczysnki tried to withdraw inside the cabin , but was restrained after his capture , mr kaczynski gave no further resistance , but instead , one official said , became quite personable , and well spoken , but asked for a lawyer although a psychological profile suggested he might be eager to cooperate , he declined to answer questions but engaged in pleasant small talk with the agents the search for the answers he declined to give is proceeding primarily on two separate tracks by agents from the fbi , the bureau of alcohol , tobacco and firearms and the postal inspection service one will be a detailed examination of physical evidence investigators can uncover from mr kaczynski s cabin , seeking links to the mountainous pile of bomb fragments , writings and package scraps collected over the nearly 18year investigation into the bombing campaign agents have carefully preserved and catalogued evidence from each of the bomb crime scenes , as well as the bomber s written communications to victims and news organizations , carefully analyzing the mailing labels and stamps the other path of inquiry will focus on building what agents call an investigative profile that could provide links in time and place between mr kaczynski and the bomber known until recently only through postmarks agents said they had no reason , so far , to suspect anyone other than mr kaczynski investigators said they were examining whether mr kaczynski traveled by bus in the days preceding the dates when package bombs were mailed from cities far from montana , like sacramento , calif they are also investigating whether he stayed at homeless shelters or inexpensive motels along the route other agents are combing through air travel records to determine whether mr kaczynski might have flown from helena , mont , to the cities from which the bombs were mailed investigators are also interviewing associates and classmates at the universities where mr kaczynski studied and worked we always believed there would come a day when all these many bits of information would begin to come together and that day was the day we executed the search warrant , one lawenforcement official said today
los angeles , sept 6 given that he is a lame duck , a badly trounced presidential candidate and , as an abortion rights backer , a sometimes divisive misfit within the republican party , gov pete wilson should be easing into the political sunset , by most reckonings he is not instead , with little more than two years left in his second term in sacramento his final one , by statute mr wilson is all over the landscape , acting like a politician who has plenty of gas left , wherever the road may lead , whatever others may think , however high his negatives in the polls at the republican national convention in san diego last month , which he had once hoped would be a crowning moment for him , he managed to salvage some bold headlines , some prime broadcast time and , yes , plenty of opprobrium by forcing the abortion rights issue to the surface , thereby stirring up the only real fight of what was otherwise an almost soporific gathering no sooner was he back in sacramento than he grabbed the national limelight again , announcing that he would eagerly sign into law the only bill ever passed by any legislature in the nation to call for chemical castration of repeat child molesters then he kept the light focused on himself by becoming the nation s first governor to use provisions of the new federal welfare law as grounds for an executive order eliminating a wide range of state services to illegal immigrants next , lest anyone still failed to get the message that pete wilson considered himself alive and well politically , he served notice that he would campaign unrelentingly this fall to elect republican majorities in both houses of the state legislature \( only the assembly is currently in republican hands \) and then , he went on , over the next two years he will pressure the legislature to complete his unfinished agenda more money for schools , less red tape for business and more policies and programs to discourage unwanted pregnancies and the social pathology of welfare and crime that often follow further , he said , he will mount a highprofile effort this fall to win passage of a ballot initiative that would essentially do away with the state s affirmative action programs , a hotbutton issue that both bill clinton and bob dole have tiptoed around while in the state is this a man preoccupied with leaving his mark on the state s history , or is he already ankle deep in the next presidential campaign , or what \? who knows \? the 63yearold governor replied enigmatically the other day in a wideranging interview about his political past , present and future all he knows for certain , he said , is that after 30 years as an elective officeholder from the nation s biggest state , he has no intention of abandoning a publicoriented career that has taken him from backbench state assemblyman to mayor of san diego , then united states senator and now governor mr wilson , once a practicing lawyer , brushed aside speculation that he might make a living by serving on corporate boards or joining a big law firm , and also dismissed talk of a cabinet job in a dole administration as a last resort , he said , he would rather keep his hand in the public affairs game by writing or speaking much as ronald reagan did when he left the governorship perhaps as a newspaper columnist or a broadcast personality i'm not through yet , he said but i have no idea , frankly , what the future holds i want to continue to contribute for the moment , short term , i want to finish the agenda i set for california when i first became governor in 1991 , and then , long term , we 'll see what happens would he perhaps run again for the presidency \? he pondered a moment , then slid off the question , recalling sardonically that a chronically hoarse voice badly hobbled his first run , in the 1996 campaign my recommendation , he said , is that you not do it if you ca n't speak for three and a half months but many of his political friends and enemies , as well as many political analysts , believe that mr wilson has another run for the presidency in mind , probably in 2000 , provided that in the intervening years he can keep his political profile high and his political fences mended never forget that when he pulled out of the '96 race , he said he was definitely interested in coming back one day , said dan schnur , one of the governor s top aides in the shortlived 1996 campaign , who is now a political science professor at the university of california at berkeley still , there is considerable doubt that the goal will be any more attainable in 2000 than it was on the first attempt , when the governor was among the first forced from the contest , mainly for lack of support both in the polls and at the bank his negative ratings in the polls continue to be unusually high two of three california voters rate his job performance poor or only fair and although he has shifted markedly to the right in recent years with his stands on immigration and affirmative action he was a moderate early in his career he remains something of an ideological apostate to the conservatives who control his party , because of his unyielding stance in favor of a right to abortion he lost a lot a ground in that first presidential run , especially in california , where to begin with people wanted him to stay and govern the state , not run around the country , said sherry bebitch jeffe , a political analyst at the claremont center for politics and economics now he s got to rebuild his base and try to get his agenda passed , which i'm sure is important to him both for how history might view him and also should he ever run for office again none of it s easy as a lameduck governor and as a prochoice guy , though of course he still has some veto clout to wield in sacramento and maybe , if he s lucky , his party might rethink its antiabortion stance someday in an early taste of how mr wilson s low poll numbers and lameduck status will complicate his efforts to govern from here on out , officials in san francisco , always a liberal thorn to the governor , served notice this week that they would ignore his edict on eliminating services to illegal immigrants , saying they would continue such programs by using the city s own cash reserves if not the presidency in 2000 , might mr wilson run again for the senate , in 1998 , say , or 2000 \? again , he did not reply head on or perhaps he did what i really enjoy most , he said , is the chief executive role you not only get to pick the personnel to implement policy but you really have a remarkable ability to influence policy , far more so than in the legislative role photo will gov pete wilson of california , badly beaten in the 1996 presidential campaign , try it again four years from now \? or maybe try to return to the senate \? he responds with two little words who knows \? \( jim wilson the new york times \)

tuscaloosa , ala for alabama , first in little but college football , the quest three years ago for the nation s only mercedes plant touched deep , unrequited desires we 're going to get mercedes and we 're going to make them love us , gov james e folsom jr s wife , marsha , told him and anyone else at the mansion who needed bucking up as dozens of states courted the auto maker with costly promises today , a mercedes plant sheathed in gleaming metallic panels rises from the pine forests of western alabama , where even convenience stores have been few local politicians and mercedes executives continue to celebrate their victory they expect 1 , 500 new jobs at the plant and 15 , 000 to 17 , 000 related jobs in the state but the auto maker s affections have cost the state dearly tax breaks and other subsidies are pushing 300 million that amounts to 200 , 000 for each job 18 times what tennessee paid for a nissan plant in 1980 , more than 7 times what tennessee paid for the general motors saturn plant in 1985 , 4 times what kentucky paid for a toyota plant in 1985 and 3 times what south carolina paid for a bmw plant in 1992 mercedes , it appears , has driven a state with a subcompact budget to spend far beyond its means alabama , already last in elementary and secondaryschool spending , first tried raiding its education fund to keep its promises after that and other efforts failed , the state missed a 43 million payment to mercedes officials finally borrowed from the state s pension fund , at a punitive 9 percent rate to clear and level land that taxpayers bought for mercedes in the town of vance , about half an hour northeast of tuscaloosa and 45 minutes southwest of birmingham , state officials turned the work into a federal expense they called out the national guard for a training mission partly because of taxpayer backlash over the mercedes concessions , mr folsom , a democrat , and his wife are in the governor s mansion no more fob james jr , a republican opponent who during his 1994 campaign accused mr folsom of giving mercedes far too much , moved in last year and promptly called the company to renegotiate what he could still , the state has been bruised , and not just financially its hope of capitalizing on mercedes' prestige risks being overshadowed by its reputation for overpaying the state s job calculations are wishful thinking , said william gunther , an analyst of the state s economy at the university of alabama we 're all suffering from winner s curse though states have used incentives to court corporations for decades , the mercedes deal and its extraordinary costs show how the war between the states can get out of hand in an era of corporate downsizing , politicians are often judged by how many jobs they create in the private sector companies , no longer loyal to a city or a state , find that their most valuable asset is the leverage they hold in choosing a site economists argue that rich incentives often fail to yield adequate returns for a city or state , and certainly not for the nation s workers and taxpayers as a whole corporate welfare , they say , diverts money better spent attracting businesses through improved infrastructure and schools it is nothing but a zerosum game , said robert b reich , the united states secretary of labor resources are moved around peter is robbed to pay paul companies that say they value schools but milk states for subsidies are being hypocritical , he added at a conference organized by the federal reserve bank of minneapolis only congressional restrictions can halt this war , arthur j rolnick , the research director for the minneapolis fed , said in an interview he proposes that washington tax as income up to 100 percent of any incentives or subsidies that a company receives to move such a law , which would infuriate business leaders and state officials , has little chance in an election year but many lawmakers are already broaching the issue a recent request by congress for an investigation of possible improprieties in states' use of federal money to lure businesses was one of the few shared causes of senator edward m kennedy , the massachusetts democrat , and senator alfonse m d'amato , the new york republican also , senator daniel patrick moynihan , the new york democrat , has sponsored a bill to end taxfree financing for stadiums absent such legislation , and there is no reason to believe that the battles to get and keep businesses will let up soon states' truces seldom endure new york city has repeatedly cut deals for corporations threatening to move out last year it awarded more than 30 million each to morgan stanley and to kidder , peabody company california and the city of anaheim agreed to spend 800 million on roads and other improvements , mostly to the benefit of the walt disney company , after it threatened to cancel an expansion or even move mickey , donald and the whole disneyland park utah gave micron technology inc an estimated 200 million in concessions to build a computer chip plant in the town of lehi , though micron halted construction last winter when chip prices fell
the white house is considering felix rohatyn , the investment banker who helped save new york city from financial collapse in the 1970 s , as a possible nominee to become vice chairman of the federal reserve board he would be a worthy choice , a man of stature and experience whose views might help the fed wring the most growth out of the economy mr rohatyn , a managing director of lazard freres company , has an unusual blend of expertise that embraces the financial , business and political worlds he is respected on wall street in the political realm , he is hailed as the architect of the financial manipulations and tight controls that kept new york city out of bankruptcy in 1975 he is among the few highly successful figures on wall street who back progressive causes and activist government yet his quest for stronger economic growth and balanced budgets has won him endorsements from the heads of many major corporations few will challenge mr rohatyn s intellect or financial sagacity but some economists will object that he , unlike the outgoing vice chairman , alan blinder , has no background in the fed s primary mission setting the nation s money supply in order to control inflation and dampen temporary downturns but by that standard , almost none of the fed board members deserved appointment most were bankers whose careers gave them no more experience in determining monetary policy than did mr rohatyn s career on wall street the fed has a highly qualified staff to guide members through the technical ins and outs of policy options mr rohatyn has called for policies that would lead to faster growth than either the current fed or many economists think feasible his views are unlikely to square with those of the current chairman , alan greenspan but good can come out of such tension indeed , mr blinder challenged the chairman over the past few years , nudging policy in a direction that in hindsight has proved beneficial the fed is supposed to keep the economy growing fast enough to keep the unemployment rate low but most economists agree that there is some point at which , if unemployment is driven any lower , the fed would ignite increases in wages and prices eventually , the fed would be forced to crack down and , as in the early 1980 s , drive the economy into a steep recession the problem is no one knows just how low unemployment can fall before inflation kicks in most would say around the current rate of 55 percent others think the fed , by lowering interest rates , could drive unemployment as low as 5 percent everyone on the board agreed that interest rates needed to rise in 1994 and fall last year but mr blinder wanted less steep increases in 1994 and steeper reductions last year hindsight suggests he may have been right the economy has slowed , with industrial production nearly stagnant , and this week the fed is expected to drop interest rates one more time to give the economy another kick mr blinder s voice , then , will be missed judging from his public writings , mr rohatyn would be a valuable replacement mr greenspan gets very high marks for his stewardship of the fed since 1987 , steering the economy through uninterrupted growth and declining inflation growth has been slow , but that is the fault of sluggish productivity , over which the fed has little if any control assuming mr greenspan is appointed by mr clinton to another fouryear term , he will continue to control fed policy but that is all the more reason to add a shrewd counterweight to the chairman s instinctual conservatism mr rohatyn could serve that valuable role
a fossil dinosaur has been found in china that shows traces of feathery down along its spine and sides a sign that it may have been an early ancestor of birds dinosaur fossils include some remnants of skin , scales and even color patterns , but until now none have shown evidence of feathers news of the little dinosaur s discovery spread quickly yesterday at the annual meeting of the society of vertebrate paleontology at the american museum of natural history in new york although there were no formal announcements of the discovery , scientists crowded hallways and meeting rooms to look at photographs of the chinese specimen brought to the meeting by dr philip j currie , chief of dinosaur research at the tyrell museum of paleontology in drumheller , alberta many of the experts who looked at the photographs pronounced them to be important new support for the theory that birds descended from dinosaurs dinosaurs of course did not fly , but a finding that some had feathers would not be altogether surprising it has long been supposed that feathers might have originated for purposes of insulation , not flight still , the popular image of these ancient creatures could change rather sharply if the new finding sends artists back to their drawing boards for their confident reconstructions of how dinosaurs looked the way the new finding was announced makes it particularly hard to evaluate since though it was presented at a scientific meeting , there was no written article giving a scholarly assessment of the fossil s provenance and date , just a photograph shown by dr currie and a chinese colleague , dr chen peiji of the department of geology at beijing university , in the hallways rarely are scientific findings of this possible importance presented so casually dr currie said the fossil of the yardlong dinosaur , which appears to be a type of compsognathid carnivore , was discovered by farmers near the village of yianxin in liaoning province in august it came to the attention of dr currie and a canadian dinosaur artist , michael w skrepnick , two weeks ago in beijing while they were leading a commercial tour group called dinotour the tourists had already left for home , and we were taking some time to look at specimens at the department of geology at beijing university , dr currie said when i saw this slab of silt stone mixed with volcanic ash in which the creature is embedded , i was bowled over the fossil slab is actually in two parts representing opposite sides of the fossil each side was sold by the finder to a different chinese institution , one in beijing and the other in nanjing the two slabs are complementary a comparison of photographs of the two sides shows that in places where the line of down along the spine is missing in one slab , it is present in the other the scientists describe the down as typical of the kind that in true birds eventually develops into feathers , including the kind used for flight the down in this specimen appears to be purely for insulation , dr currie said there s no sign of the aerodynamic shapes you see in flight feathers the photographs , which the chinese authorities have barred from publication , show a dark , furry ridge running along the animal s spine from the top of its head to the tip of its tail there is a suggestion of similar downy fur extending part way down its sides like other fossils of compsognathids , it has sharp teeth , long hind limbs , and seems well suited to hunting lizards and other small prey whatever it is , this down is not scaly , dr currie said the little dinosaurs lived in a region where there were many fish , which may have been their main food so far , dr currie said , no scientific paper describing the discovery has been published , and therefore the experts have been unable to evaluate the photographs \( or the fossils themselves \) in any systematic way at the paleontology meeting , however , dr currie and a coauthor presented a paper on another subject , showing that the wishbone of tyrannosaurus rex has features in common with birds dr john h ostrom of yale university , who has argued since the 1970 s that at least some dinosaurs were warm blooded , said the chinese specimen , which clearly seems to support his views on dinosaurs and birds , had left him in a state of shock although various dinosaur groups had been considered candidates as ancestral birds , the goosesize compsognathus , which lived about 125 million years ago , was not among the leading contenders this will certainly lend support to those who believe that birds descended from dinosaurs , dr ostrom said the evidence of kinship between dinosaurs and birds is based mainly on the close similarity of their skeletal forms the halfdozen fossils known to exist of the the earliest known true bird , archaeopteryx , look like the feathered remains of compsognathus although many paleontologists have come to conclude that birds are direct descendants of dinosaurs , no true dinosaur had been found exhibiting down or feathers until the latest chinese specimen came to light drawing traces of feathery down found on

oyster bay , li , may 3 an offduty new york city housing police officer shot and killed one of four men trying to rob his father s gasoline station here thursday night , the nassau county police said today the three other suspects , who were arrested shortly after the attempted robbery , told the police that the slain suspect had bragged about holding up the same getty station on pine hollow road a year ago this time , however , joseph capapano , a 23yearold officer assigned to a police housing unit in brooklyn , was working at the station , filling in for his father , joseph capapano sr , who purchased the station only six weeks ago he was helping his dad out , pumping some gas , when around 9 30 this fellow walks in and begins talking about maybe buying some cigarettes , said detective sgt robert edwards the fellow hung around for a few minutes and joe asked if he wanted any help and he said he was waiting for his girlfriend , sergeant edwards said when joe turned around to walk into the service bay , this fellow grabbed him from behind , put his arm around the neck in a choke hold , stuck a hard object into his back and said 'all i want is your money do n't do anything crazy and you wo n't be hurt' at that point , officer capapano , who was dressed in mechanic s clothes but carrying his service revolver under his belt , grabbed his gun , turned and fired two shots into the robber , sergeant edwards said the police said they later determined that the slain suspect , dwight oliver , 33 , of glen cove , li , was not armed and had apparently formed a fist and pressed a knuckle into the officer s back there was no way for officer capapano to know that the suspect was not armed , sergeant edwards said the respone was instantaneous sergeant edwards said he did not believe that officer capapano had done anything wrong like nassau county police officers , he said , mr capapano was required to carry his service revolver while off duty sergeant edwards said another offduty new york city housing police officer who worked with officer capapano in brooklyn had witnessed the incident he said the other officer , who was not identified , had brought a car in for repairs and was in the bay service area when he saw the attempted robbery the police said mr oliver was unemployed and had an arrest record in nassau for a robbery in 1995 and an illegal drug sale in 1993 the three other suspects kenneth wilson , 19 , stan ambles , 25 , and matt laboy , 23 , all of glen cove were arrested in a parking lot behind the gasoline station in a car that the police said had stolen license plates they were charged with conspiracy to commit robbery , and all pleaded not guilty at their arraignment this afternoon in first district nassau county court in hempstead judge leah ruskin set bail for mr wilson and mr ambles at 25 , 000 each and for mr laboy at 50 , 000 , because of an arrest record none of the suspects made bail , and they were remanded to the county jail a hearing was scheduled for tuesday sergeant edwards said that the four men had been drinking beer in their car when they decided to commit a robbery one of them said he had done this station before , sergeant edwards said , so they gave him a hooded pullover sweatshirt what they call a hoodie and he wore that into the gas station police records showed that an unsolved robbery had occurred at the station a year ago and the description of the robber fits that of dwight oliver , sergeant edwards said
no more dc no more kenny no more big nets names , nuttiness or news khalid reeves \? shawn bradley \? chris childs \? go ahead try to make a racy back page out of them armon gilliam \? kevin edwards \? p j brown \? all together now whoopdedamndo kendall gill \? he has been traded three times in two years , has had his share of personal complications but he is no new york city legend , no no 1 pick in the draft , no wouldbe superstar for better or worse , professional basketball teams are defined by those players by catchy names and familiar faces who are the new jersey nets \? brown wondered friday after they traded kenny anderson and gerald glass to charlotte for gill and reeves they are the islanders in sneakers , that s who they are from strictly a basketball point of view , the deal which is temporarily delayed while the nets reexamine reeves s injured left ankle was a defensible way out of a hapless predicament the nets' general performance has n't suffered from dumping derrick coleman and his 7 millionayear salary last month subtracting anderson wo n't make a drastic difference in their level of achievement now whether it s this deal for anderson or another one , the nets are going to be a starless team if they 're all on the same page , if bradley can grow muscles , the nets might even become more like their national basketball association role models , the overachieving cleveland cavaliers then maybe they can shed their laughingstock image , get into the business of attracting free agents instead of losing them the emphasis on the team is going to take over , as opposed to the focus always being on the marquee player , michael rowe , the nets' president , said friday rowe is quite serious about this , so he will gladly swap the 6 o'clock news coverage generated by coleman and anderson for a calmer , gentler new jersey nets a team more closely associated with the concept of family entertainment , with the suburban experience , like dinner at bennigan s we want players who are happy to be in new jersey , rowe said this is not the firpt time the nets have been purged of highprofile talent twenty years ago , as one of four financially strapped teams to survive the american basketball association , the new york nets had a new arena in nassau county and pro basketball s most exciting young hang glider to fill it up then the owner , roy boe , sold julius erving to philadelphia the nets never recovered , no matter where they played it should be understood that erving was not on'y a revolutionary talent but also the consummate basketball ambassador as if cursed for boe s allowing erving to leave , the nets have n't had a star they could brag about since they have only known blown opportunities , and shattered dreams remember bubbles hawkins \? of course you do n't posterving , this southpaw guard showed excellent promise as a goto scorer until one night , riding the team s wobbly charter , he vomited in the lap of kevin loughery , who happened to be his coach hawkins was soon gone , replaced by a catalog of others doomed to suffer a similarly ignominious fate john williamson was a prolific scorer but a voracious eater bernard king sought treatment for alcoholism and became a great player , but only after he had left the nets his younger brother , albert , never lived up his brooklyn high school clippings nor did a fellow new york legend , pearl washington another high firstround draft pick , dennis hopson , quickly became a spectacular bust darryl dawkins brought his provocative dunks to new jersey , fell in a hot tub , hurt his back and drifted away micheal ray richardson raised hopes with dazzling play , then was banned by the league for using drugs chris morris knew how to score but forgot how to lace up his sneakers drazen petrovic , on the verge of nba stardom , died in a car crash on a german autobahn it is too optimistic to think that none of this would have happened if petrovic had lived coleman would n't practice , would n't listen , no matter who his teammates and coaches were anderson and , yes , petrovic , followed coleman s selfish lead kenny was too young to overcome that , said dick gilbert , a new york businessman and longtime confidant to anderson it was never going to work out unless coleman was going to run the floor , not watch practice from the fourth row with his mobile phone and his sneakers off i'm so glad this is all behind him in philadelphia , coleman is proving that none of what happened in new jersey was a fluke , or anyone else s fault now anderson apparently goes to charlotte , where the hornets , with plenty of scorers , will give him a chance to pile up the assists , to rebuild his image maybe david falk , the agent who seems to be running the nba , will bring him dikembe mutombo when the denver center s contract expires next summer maybe the hornets will become a team with the possibilities the nets seemed to have three short years ago or in 1983 with micheal ray , and in 1976 with dr j who knows how high the nets might have soared had it not been for roy boe s inglorious sale \? who knows what their reputation would have become \? instead , they have had 20 years of flawed leadership , of failed stars now they are gone no more d c no more kenny dinner at bennigan s is on michael rowe photo kenny anderson practiced with the hornets yesterday , but couldnot play because his trade was delayed \( associated press \)
grand rapids , mich on a saturday evening at calvary church , a modern structure beside interstate 96 , the rev rob bell finished his sermon and reached for the slips of paper that ushers have collected from among the 400 people in the pews each contained a handwritten \( but anonymous \) question he read the first aloud a woman wrote about her miscarriage , asking if god was punishing her no , mr bell said , god does not act in that way the bible , he added , teaches about god s love he pulled out another how can one comfort a friend depressed about a personal failure \? someone asks get the friend to talk about it and to see a christian counselor , mr bell said turning to scripture , he said god offers forgiveness through christ afterward , he said , he and some volunteers will remain to speak with those who want to talk further in some secular settings , questions are expected british politicians face a question time in parliament , teachers are quizzed by students , and advice columnists like ann landers handle all manner of queries but for a member of the clergy to take questions during a worship service about faith , sexual morality and the seeming absence of god amid suffering is unusual , to say the least at calvary , an independent evangelical church that draws several thousand people on sundays , these sessions started eight years ago , part of an informal saturday service begun by the pastor , the rev ed dobson , who shares duties with mr bell , a recent seminary graduate i think what people are yearning for , is a place where they do n't have to have it all together , said mr bell the service , he said , is a safe place to wrestle with the things calvary s 6 pm saturday service is part of a larger trend , as churches experiment with a variety of ways to reach socalled seekers , unaffiliated people looking for meaning but alienated from traditional worship mr dobson , who is also a senior editor of the magazine christianity today , has helped spread the thinking behind such innovations with a howto book , starting a seeker sensitive service \( zondervan , 1993 \) a decade ago , mr dobson was prominent on the christian right , as a board member of the rev jerry falwell s moral majority inc and vice president of liberty university but then he renounced political involvement , warning that it threatened to coopt the church at calvary , he started the saturday night service with bands that play rock , jazz or punk tunes with religious lyrics , sermons that try to show how scripture bears on everyday issues like family life and emotions , and an air of informality set by preachers in blue jeans other churches have started similar seeker services with contemporary music and an informal atmosphere but robb redman , assistant professor of theology and ministry at fuller theological seminary in pasadena , calif , said he knew of none with a questionandanswer session like calvary s , although some might do it on occasion i think we 're in a period of wideopen experimentation in worship forms , he said calvary s sessions , professor redman said , might be considered a '90s version of an altar call , an evangelical church tradition in which people are asked to step forward and commit themselves to faith the sense is , we want to connect with you and your issues , he said when mr dobson began the service , he expected questions about the bible , about the meaning of particular passages some people did ask things like whether jonah was really swallowed by a whale \( he was , mr dobson told them \) but most focus on personal matters many concern sexual issues is it , for example , sinful for an unmarried couple to live together \? \( yes , answered mr dobson , who says the bible ordains marriage as the place for sexual relations \) many questions reflected personal pain some people asked how they can they be expected to forgive those who wronged them others asked where god was when they were abused or molested , or suffered the loss of a loved one to suicide theological training implies that you have all the answers , mr dobson said , and part of the experience of saturday night is you have to say , 'i have no idea how to answer that' that is especially true , he said , when people say they felt god was absent during their misfortunes i ca n't explain where god was , mr dobson said he responded but god knows what you 're going through , because he had a son whom he sent into the world , who was beaten and eventually crucified he added that he told people that coming to faith is not a way out of your troubles , but rather establishes a relationship with god , from which one can derive strength for his part , mr bell said he tried to avoid giving pat responses the bible alone provides answers , he said , adding , i do n't want to sell it short as word of calvary s saturday services has spread , visitors have come by to pick up ideas for their own churches but none of them , by what i know , do the questions and answers , mr dobson said in part , because it s pretty high risk but for us , it s one sign of authenticity , that we 're not afraid to be questioned in a public way photo the rev rob bell at one of calvary church s informal saturday evening services , which include a questionandanswer session \( robert killips for the new york times \)
augusta , ga , april 9 when michael campbell , masters rookie , arrived at the 12th tee at augusta national this week for his first shot at the meanest little par3 hole on the planet , he got a quick lesson on why it has been 17 years since a firsttime masters player has won this tournament campbell watched intently as ernie els hit an 8iron right at the flag on the 155yard hole when els s shot fell short , into the front bunker , campbell naturally figured he would need to hit one more club to get there usually , that s basic , sound reasoning but not at augusta all of a sudden the wind dies down and i hit a 7iron right through the back of the green , near the flowers , he said i did n't know the wind was blowing how does it do that \? welcome to augusta , mr campbell , where learning to interpret subtle hints you have to watch the tops of the towering pines over by the 13th tee and behind the 12th green to see the wind blow can make the difference between contending and departing on masters weekend there are 19 firsttime masters competitors here for the year s first major championship , the largest number since 1980 the sheer numbers and the high quality of these players has people wondering whether this will be the year that another upstart can overcome augusta the way fuzzy zoeller did back in 1979 when he became just the third rookie winner , the first since gene sarazen rode his doubleeagle to a playoff victory in 1935 weighing in with the brashness of youth is john daly , 29 years old and already the owner of two major championships sure , one of these guys could win , he said they do n't care anything about history or who won back in nineteenhundredandwhatever neither do i magnolia lane is just another road and i sure as hell do n't get any chills driving up it , unless i got my windows down these young guys ai n't scared of anything he might have a point it used to be that masters rookies would speak in hushed tones about all the history that wraps around augusta like wisteria after all , 94yearold gene sarazen who merely invented the sand wedge , not to mention the double eagle was sitting upstairs in the manor clubhouse having lunch today at the same time , though , campbell , 27 years old , was standing down on the lawn under the ancient oak tree talking about making a little history of his own records are made to be broken history is made to be rewritten , said campbell , a new zealand native of maori descent there s nothing to say that i could n't do very well here , even if it is my first time nick faldo , 38 , a twotime champion who has played in every masters since 1979 , has a slightly more temperate viewpoint nothing s impossible , he said , but you know , experience pays dividends at augusta i think you need to know what you 're doing , know your routes , how to play , when you 're going to be aggressive and defensive it is all of that and more it is knowing when to look at the tops of the trees , or the placement of the pin , or which direction the mowers cut the fairways , or how shiny the greens are , or whether the wind will blow the ball off a green i think if a rookie is going to win in any year , this might be the year for it , said lee janzen you look at the quality of those guys who have won recently , they 're playing well coming in , they 've got a lot of confidence they 're a different kind of rookie that ca n't be denied tim herron , 26 , who won the honda classic , is the only official tour rookie along with paul goydos , who won at bay hill , scott mccarron who won at new orleans , none of them showed any qualms about taking on the biggest names in the sport at some very formidable golf courses and beating them david duval has been in contention the last two weeks , justin leonard is a fine player , jim furyk is very long and a wonderful putter and steve stricker is a complete player paul stankowski , the final qualifier for the masters after winning the bellsouth classic last sunday , came out of nowhere after missing five cuts in his previous six events going into atlanta he would have been a longshot anyway , but is especially so now after waking up monday , and playing a practice round today , with an aching neck there are even amateurs in this field , like tiger woods and gordon sherry , the british amateur champion , who have more than enough game and just the proper amount of arrogance to contend here the operative word is contend because so many things conspire against the inexperienced player here that a victory by a firsttimer would be the most surprising turn of events yet in a golf season rife with them no player in the field knows more about the history of augusta national and how it inveighs on a newcomer s game than ben crenshaw , a twotime winner and defending champion and what is the hardest thing for a masters rookie \? the crowds and the excitement , the emotion , he said the power of these greens has everyone thinking , and you 're thinking about the shots you want to play to them , the putts you had in the past there s a lot to learn , there s a lot to put your finger on in other words , before you put on the green jacket , you have to try on a whole lot of history some of these firsttimers do n't think so , but the years say that s the way it is chip shots the greens , dried by brisk winds and hardened by high skies , are as firm and fast as they have been in years , according to phil mickelson i 've never seen them this fast this early in the week david duval aced the 12th hole in his practice round with an 8iron ben crenshaw s name was the first to appear on the ledger as players signed in this week and he is ready to play during his first practice round on monday , he shot 65 he s rolling it , said his caddie , carl jackson , with a wide smile photo paul stankowski , last to qualify for the masters , practicing at augusta national yesterday a stiff neck prevented him from practicing monday \( associated press \)

trying to save piggy sneed by john irving 432 pages arcade publishing 2195 trying to save piggy sneed , john irving s eclectic new anthology of fiction and nonfiction , bears the same relationship to his eight published novels as a tasting menu does to a restaurant s fullcourse dinner it offers the reader a representative sample of mr irving s work that highlights both his weaknesses and his strengths his fondness for elaborate , trickedup plots his penchant for eccentric characters who come to violent or bizarre ends his vonnegutinspired taste for little homilies \( repetition is boring and you pay for grace \) and his predilection for cloying cuteness , which manifests itself most frequently in a proliferation of fictional bears circus bears , pet bears , even people in bear suits a presiding theme in mr irving s bestknown novel , the world according to garp \( 1908 \) , was the relationship between mundane reality and a writer s imagination , and this same theme percolates through the stories and essays in piggy sneed in fact , many of the fictional heroes in this collection are given to melodramatic daydreaming that transforms the banal surface of their daily lives into the sort of antic extravaganzas found in mr irving s own novels the protagonist of a 1980 story called interior spaces , for instance , imagines climbing onto his neighbor s roof to remove the walnuts that have fallen into the rain gutters and immediately envisions the headlines in the morning papers doctor takes fourstory fall ! urologist beaned by nut ! career cut short by deadly tree ! in the volume s title essay , mr irving points out that he is prone to this same sort of imaginative embroidery a fiction writer s memory is an especially imperfect provider of detail , he writes we can always imagine a better detail than the one we can remember the correct detail is rarely , exactly , what happened the most truthful detail is what could have happened , or what should have perhaps this is the very reason mr irving proves to be such a boring memoirist although the aforementioned piggy sneed is a small gem of writing , it turns out to be less an act of reminiscence than a carefully contrived meditation on what might have happened to the dimwitted garbage collector mr irving knew as a boy in exeter , nh , and the transformative powers of art in contrast , the real piece of autobiography in this volume , a lengthy reminiscence titled the imaginary girlfriend , is plodding , padded and , with the exception of a few cameo portraits , deadeningly dull half of the imaginary girlfriend reads like one of those mimeographed letters some people send to relatives at christmas it s filled with perfunctory accounts of trips and meals and injuries , all recounted in flatfooted prose the other half belongs in an amateur wrestling magazine it goes on , numbingly , about mr irving s youthful wrestling exploits coaches , tournaments , opponents and weighins none of this need be boring think of joyce carol oates s fascinating meditations on boxing but mr irving fails to muster the narrative passion that might communicate his obsession with the sport to the reader the other memoir in this volume , my dinner at the white house , is even clumsier , portraying the author as sophomoric hypocrite in this piece and accompanying notes , mr irving rails at length against dangerous and deceitful republicans , denouncing dan quayle s bullying idiocy about 'family values' and blaming rightwing conservatives for ruining our country he nonetheless says he was shortsighted in turning down an invitation from dan quayle to dine at the white house with a group of select republicans he also goes on , rather gleefully , about the time president george bush was ill in japan , what mr irving refers to as the barfing episode and the upchuck in asia !

johannesburg , oct 7 for a while , sarafina was back she was no longer that spunky soweto schoolgirl fighting the injustices of apartheid in a hit broadway show she was all grown up a social worker teaching the dangers of unsafe sex in a lavish musical that was supposed to tour south africa to carry the antiaids message to the illiterate but very soon after sarafina 2 opened here last spring , questions began to arise aids experts called some of its dialogue dangerously inaccurate , its message unclear and people wondered why had it cost so much \? how had the cashstrapped national health department , the sponsor of the second version , paid for it \? as a musical , it closed quickly as a story of government bungling , it is still running six months later and many south africans see it as an example of a disturbing trend even some supporters say that after more than two years in office , the african national congress is developing a poor record on handling charges of corruption and misconduct within its ranks in the sarafina episode , the cabinet minister in charge of health has been caught lying to parliament the production contract turned out to have gone to a good friend of hers proper bidding procedures were ignored the private donor she said had paid the bill had never heard of the play but perhaps most disturbing to many south africans is that so far not a head has rolled not even a reprimand has been issued , a situation that has prompted much talk about the state of accountability in the new south africa far from condemning the debacle , officials of the african national congress have fiercely defended the health commissioner , dr nkosazana zuma president nelson mandela recently lashed out at the news media for creating such an uproar and said dr zuma should be left alone to do her job in africa , few would question that president mandela s young government still holds the moral high ground on a continent where turmoil and decline are often the norm , the african national congress has formed a government committed to racial reconciliation , human rights , democracy and openness but since taking office , the party has come under fire for its handling of the sarafina fiasco and half a dozen other highprofile cases for instance , after nearly two years , charges that party stalwarts like the rev allan boesak and winnie mandela misused private funds have yet to be resolved more recently , one party leader who embarked on an effort to root out corruption found himself on the verge of losing his job for failing to consult with the party and gen bantu holomisa , a deputy cabinet minister , was dismissed shortly after he accused another party official of taking a bribe years ago pointing to sarafina and half a dozen other incidents , critics say the party often prizes loyalty over honesty and closes ranks around the accused while slurring the accusers for instance , they say , party officials have asserted that the widespread criticism over the play has been the work of drug companies who want dr zuma ousted because of her efforts to make prescription drugs cheaper the anc has established a very clear pattern and the pattern is simple , said steve friedman , the director of the center for policy studies , a research organization you can be whatever you like as long as you are loyal the minister of health may be responsible for sarafina' but she is loyal , so she will be defended the problem is you ca n't deal with corruption this way the party s values are rooted in its history as a liberation movement during its decades of fighting the white minority government , the african national congress was often infiltrated by south africa s ruthless military and police intelligence units as a lifeordeath matter , loyalty was highly prized many critics are asking how long the transition to a political party which needs to keep its nose clean will take it is unreasonable for people not involved in the struggle to say , 'ok now overnight be a political party , ' said richard calland , who has been monitoring the new government for the institute for democracy in south africa but does that allowance last forever \? some say the party has already had enough time we did not want to replace a white corrupt government with our corrupt selves , said themba sono , a professor of economics at the university of the witswatersrand there are people trying to pretend that what is going on is nothing but the birth pangs of democracy but that is very dangerous some critics point out that even the information about corruption under the african national congress represents progress the former national party government was widely considered to have been riddled with corruption , but few of these problems resulted in investigations even so , some top african national congress officials acknowledge that the party has not distinguished itself in dealing with accusations of corruption and misconduct

what sort of ranger team will return to madison square garden in december after the coming sixgame road trip \? will it have the same players \? will it have the same coach \? will it still be in a downward spiral that continued last night at the garden with a 21 loss to the philadelphia flyers \? it was the rangers' third consecutive defeat and their fifth game in succession without a victory \( 041 \) perhaps the shakeup already has begun in a trade announced after the game , the rangers sent left wing sergio momesso to st louis for right wing brian noonan in 1994 , noonan was a member of new york s stanley cup champions much has changed since then in their last 36 games , including the end of last season and the playoffs , the rangers are 11214 they came into the game with a winning percentage of 421 , ranked 22d in the 26team national hockey league the result dropped that percentage to 400 and lowered the rangers' ranking behind the islanders , whose victory over vancouver lifted their percentage to 406 and the devils huh ! they are at 633 it was n't as if the rangers did n't try in this one they played , particularly in the third period , with a sort of frantic desperation but they could n't defeat a key rival that was playing without its biggest star , the injured eric lindros the rangers are 173 in their atlantic division philadelphia scored the winner on a powerplay goal at 5 minutes 51 seconds of the third period with adam graves in the penalty box for holding a stick , trent klatt of the flyers won the puck in the corner from brian leetch and fed a pass to pat falloon , who beat mike richter from close range shjon podein scored the other flyers goal , in the first period , on a wraparound , and leetch scored for the rangers in the second , on a screened slap shot with an injured flyer lying at the other end of the ice the rangers have scored five goals in their last nine games , none of them by mark messier sure , i 'd like mark to score , said coach colin campbell , but i 'd also like adam graves to score and luc robitaille to score and alex kovalev to score and niklas sundstrom to score they also did n't get a goal from wayne gretzky , who , campbell said , had an off night with no assists and two shots on goal against ron hextall campbell , like his players , is beginning to hear catcalls from the home fans some of them suggest that a coaching change might help campbell joked that the singsong sarcasm the fans directed at hextall ! sometimes sounded more like campbell ! we 're human , campbell said we want to win at home , you love to please everyone obviously , we 're not pleasing many people he concluded his candid remarks , stepped down from a podium , walked across the hall and put his hand on the knob to the door of his office the door was locked he walked away , looking for another point of entry across the hall , in the players' quarters , gretzky was wearing all black and messier was wearing dark blue , appropriate for their somber mood on the arena speaker system , someone had played the opening bars of funeral for a friend we 're in a very difficult situation , gretzky said we just seem to be going through a difficult time he said the garden is still one of the best places to play in behind him , along a wall , rested a hockey stick with a halfdozen pucks taped to the blade on it were the words goal generator and just win , baby messier , who had one assist but no shots on goal , said , we 're in a huge downward spiral , and , we have n't given the fans too much to cheer about he continued it s completely our fault the games are not very exciting asked if the rangers have a confidence problem , messier replied you name it that s the problem in the lounge next to him , a few players watched a big television screen showing islander highlights while an announcer made sarcastic remarks about their small crowd the rangers sell all their tickets they do n't have the islanders' problems and , in between the jeers at the world s most famous arena , a fan can close his mouth , listen closely and almost hear the cheers from long island or new jersey neil smith , the president and general manager , said momesso was not in our good books with no goals , no assists and frequent benchings for lethargic play noonan , coming off a knee injury , has two goals and five assists it s not a shakeup deal , smith said over all , we think we 've improved the team as he spoke , his words were backed by the sound of flushing water from a nearby lavatory we need help now , smith said photos the rangers' brian leetch , left , trying to find the net during a scramble in front of the flyers' goal last night \( barton silverman the new york times \) \( pg 17 \) the rangers' daniel goneau , on the ice , and the flyers' karl dykhuis battling for control of the puck last night the rangers lost again by 21 \( barton silverman the new york times \) \( pg 23 \)
there are no sentimental tugs for johnny unitas when he turns on the television and sees the famous horseshoe on the side of the helmet no flashbacks to yankee stadium , 1958 i'm not the emotional type , he said and the indianapolis colts are not his team as far as he s concerned , these colts are 12 years old and without tradition , unlike the three other storied national football league playoff semifinalists so unitas wo n't be rooting today when the colts play the pittsburgh steelers at three rivers stadium , shooting for the first super bowl appearance by a team named the colts since 1971 the day they left town , that was it , he said real colts , their hall of fame quarterback wanted to make perfectly clear , do not pick up in the middle of the night and move from memorial stadium to a city known for a speedway they do not go play under some sterile , climatecontrolled dome they make baltimore their home forever baltimore was always a real football town , and still is , said jim mutscheller , the tight end and one of unitas s trusted targets on two of the colts' championship teams he sells insurance in baltimore , where people still pat him on the back for catching unitas s brave pass to the 1yard line on first down at the 10 in overtime of the national football league championship game of 1958 that set up alan ameche s touchdown that beat the giants in pro football s earliest strike against baseball s hold on america s professional teamsports soul new york has its 1961 yankees , 1969 jets , 1970 knicks and 1986 mets baltimore has its 1958 and 1959 colts the colts at that time grew up at about the same time television was starting to grow , mutscheller said it just became one of those things in baltimore it was at all levels it did n't matter whether you were at the level of the country club or you worked for bethlehem steel when robert irsay backed up the vans in the middle of the night in 1984 , he took everything but the memories they were not for sale the baltimore colts' alumni stayed behind , adrift and bitter unitas mutscheller ordell braase art donovan lenny moore alex sandusky to me , they were not the colts anymore , mutscheller said they were the hoosiers they used to run an annual charity golf tournament but people lost interest after the colts had gone now they sometimes get together for a round at the country club that donovan owns a few have dinner every couple of months mutscheller saw a few excolts sign autographs at a card show last week maybe 30 to 35 guys still live here , unitas said in the old days , we had a general manager named don kellett as soon as the team was set in training camp , he 'd sit us down and say 'you 're a baltimore colt you 're going to make a name for yourself in this town raise your family here get an offseason job' other than commercial shoots , football players need not work in the off season anymore they generally do n't stay in the same city very long , either they go where there is room under the salary cap now , in this era of shifting demographics and luxurysuite revenue , the owners have decided that free agency works for them , too so baltimore is going to get another team , as soon as art modell sidesteps the legal challenges to his move from cleveland big deal , said donovan , the former lineman and resident comic we 're just doing to cleveland what indianapolis did to us this franchise hopping will continue , too no public outcry is going to stop it no politician can legislate against an owners' lack of loyalty or decency no commissioner has the power to make someone turn down what he thinks is a better deal the least paul tagliabue could do , unitas said , is lobby modell to keep the browns' name in cleveland and irsay to return the colts' name to baltimore fans and former players do n't care who the owner is and since the players turn over every two or three years , people are , more than ever , rooting for merchandised laundry bring back the name and the horseshoes , then maybe unitas will drop his grudge pete rozelle should have made irsay give the name back when he left , he said i said years ago , there s no loyalty anymore in the nfl no regard for the past out of respect for ted marchibroda , who coached the colts from 1975 through 1979 , none of the former colts would go as far as to root for them to lose and braase , a defensive end who joined the colts in 1957 and retired after they lost to the jets in super bowl iii to cap the 1968 season , had his own confession to make i have n't had any attachment to the colts at all , braase said i did n't play under irsay , thank god but i have to admit , i found myself pulling for them last week i like jim harbaugh you have to admire a guy who went through the abuse he did in chicago and survived back in memorial stadium , braase said , harbaugh could have been a vintage baltimore colt photos art donovan , known to younger football fans as a comical tvpitchman , was

pittsburgh , aug 5 with little dissent , the democratic platform committee today approved a party platform that espouses the clinton administration s policies on jobs , education and crime , promises tax breaks to help offset the costs of attending college and embraces the republicandrafted welfare bill that the president has promised to sign holding fast to new democrat ideals that shaped bill clinton s 1992 presidential campaign , the platform calls for smaller government , for law and order , and for a shifting of more authority from washington to the states this platform is about the future , said mayor dennis archer of detroit , cochairman of the committee this platform shows how today s democratic party is different from the past and ready for the future this platform will bring us to victory in november although the 34page document adopted today requires approval of the delegates to the party s national convention , in chicago at the end of the month , there is little in it that breaks ground different from that of the 1992 platform , or that most democrats would find contentious the platform sprang mostly from a draft that another party panel , the platform drafting committee , produced in early july in kansas city , mo that draft , written by the administration , was rubberstamped today , with only a few changes , by the 186member platform committee at a meeting that took just three hours committee members said the platform drew a sharp distinction between democrats and republicans on a variety of issues minimum wage , gun control , gay and lesbian rights but none more so than abortion , which is expected to be a major issue in the presidential and congressional elections this fall the democratic party stands behind the right of every woman to choose , consistent with roe v wade , and regardless of ability to pay , the platform says we believe it is a fundamental constitutional liberty that individual americans not government can best take responsibility for making the most difficult and intensely personal decisions regarding reproduction the platform is peppered throughout with attacks on speaker newt gingrich and on bob dole , mr clinton s apparent opponent the committee s meeting , in a hotel ballroom , was open to the public , and the only discordant voices came from two spectators in a public gallery at the back of the room , who denounced the committee and mr clinton for supporting the welfare bill that congress passed last week the democratic party is turning its back on the poor , one protester , daniel kovalik , a labor lawyer from pittsburgh , said before he was hustled out of the room i for one will not be voting for bill clinton , because of the welfare bill about an hour after mr kovalik had been ejected , the other protester , joni rabinowitz , a democratic committeewoman in pittsburgh , stood and said , this welfare bill is the most vicious , antihuman and pernicious bill that i have ever seen welfare was one of the few subjects on which the committee was led to rework the platform as originally drafted , the platform attacked two earlier republicandrafted welfare bills , which , although similar to the one that the president has said he will sign , were vetoed by him then , after mr clinton s announcement of support last week , committee officials amended the platform s language over the weekend to reflect his new stance , while ignoring the republicans who wrote the legislation now , the new language says , because of the president s leadership and with the support of a majority of the democrats in congress , national welfare reform is going to make work and responsibility the law of the land
boston , sept 26 presumably , jimmy key was entrenched as the yankees' third starter for the postseason presumably , winning 10 of his last 14 decisions made him untouchable the presumptions were incorrect because key is not secure and the yankees' continued infatuation with dwight gooden could shift key to the bullpen manager joe torre surprisingly placed key s status in peril 90 minutes before tonight s game , and then key instantly escalated the doubt with a sloppy fourrun first inning that helped steer the red sox to a 53 victory over a yankee lineup of mostly reserves at fenway park boston , however , was eliminated from contention for a wildcard spot with baltimore s victory over toronto as strange as it sounded , key was basically auditioning , and he stumbled with his first loss in five weeks although key relaxed after the forgettable first and allowed one more run in the next five innings , he might have given torre enough evidence in permitting four singles and a double in the opening inning to nudge his decision toward gooden gooden must now produce against the red sox on friday to possibly seal key s demotion to the bullpen yeah , i want to start , key said just like kenny and doc want to start we 'll see what they do to me , any of us would be a good choice like everyone else , the baffled key will have to wait for an answer key initially thought he was slotted behind david cone and andy pettitte in the postseason because reporters mentioned him as the potential third starter and was surprised when his status was questioned one day after the yankees clinched the american league east key \( 1211 \) wound up yielding four earned runs while whiffing seven and walking none torre , who said that someone would be unhappy , said nobody has been told anything yet it s not that he s not in we are n't making a commitment until we find out who we play the opponent is the critical factor influencing torre and might be why gooden merely needs to show that he can last for six innings the yankees have coddled the armfatigued gooden more than any other pitcher and it is curious that he is still in contention to start game 3 of the division series but the yankees are likely to play the rangers , and gooden defeated them , 60 , on july 23 at yankee stadium with seven scoreless innings the last start , not gooden s 02 record and 958 earned run average against texas from april , is obviously having an impact on torre the manager said for the first time that gooden will be on the roster , even as a reliever meanwhile , key was battered for a combined 10 earned runs in 10 1 3 innings while losing to the rangers at the ballpark in arlington on april 6 and on july 31 , where games 3 , 4 and 5 , if necessary , would be played torre must decide if gooden , who has 1 victory in his last 10 starts , would be a better choice than key kenny rogers has not been touted as the third starter , but he is 166 with a 332 earned run average at the ballpark we 're going to look at everything and put the puzzle together as best we can , torre said is selecting gooden a sound decision \? asked if he thought he could be a capable pitcher in october , gooden said , i do n't have the answer for that key actually said it makes sense to skip him against texas if his statistics are inferior and added , if i do n't wind up throwing against texas and kenny and doc did , god bless them let s win and get to the next level we need 25 guys to win that was not enough tonight with two outs and jeff frye on second in the first , jose canseco s single made it 10 mike greenwell singled and bill haselman tapped a ball in front of the mound that key tossed past the hardly agile cecil fielder to score another run rudy pemberton s tworun single hiked boston s lead to 40 mike maddux whiffed a careerhigh eight and gave up two runs in six and twothirds innings to doom key to his first loss since aug 21 if the yankees used key as a reliever , it would be a reprise of what happened when cone joined the blue jays and they won the world series in 1992 key did not start in the league championship series against oakland and conceded he was disappointed but key won the decisive game of the world series over atlanta in relief and that might be why he is so diplomatic now that showed me the bottom line was winning , key said it does n't matter who wins it it s how we win it if i do n't pitch , i 'll be cheering for the other guys just like i'm pitching inside pitch don mattingly , the former captain who was never part of a division winner in 14 seasons with the yankees , sent joe torre a fax congratulating him after new york won the american league east it does n't surprise me because don mattingly is a class guy and i respect him , torre said i know it has to be tugging at him that he s only gotten a taste of it you wish he was here torre chose jeff nelson to pitch the ninth inning of the clinching 192 victory over the brewers because , he said i wanted a guy who has been here all year the first guy i thought of was nellie he s had his ups and downs i felt it was a situation to make him feel good torre sounded disgusted when asked about general manager bob watson s contention that the owner george steinbrenner will dismiss him if the disastrous graeme lloyd trade with the brewers is not revised in some fashion bob and i are a team , torre said he hired me and we won the east , even though that s not what our ultimate goal is that s what we did first you 'd have a tough time telling me he did n't do a good job division series tickets go on sale at 4 30 pm today to accommodate jewish fans who will be observing the sabbath photo yankees right fielder paul o'neill popping the champagne cork in the clubhouse wednesday night after a doubleheader sweep of the brewers \( barton silverman the new york times \) \( pg b11 \)
washington , nov 8 fresh from one of the great triumphs of his life , bill clinton avoided any suggestion of triumphalism at his postelection news conference today at times , he sounded almost mellow in victory , magnanimity , counseled churchill , and the president must agree with that maxim he was clearly hugely pleased by the size of his victory , remarking with a grin that 379 electoral votes was an enormous consolation prize for having fallen short of a popularvote majority but he was clearly aware of its limitations , too , and he made a big effort , now that the howitzers of campaign hyperbole have fallen silent , to encourage stirrings of bipartisanship many in the democratic party think there is little chance of passing meaningful changes in campaign finance laws one of them , senator christopher j dodd of connecticut , the general chairman of the democratic national committee , said at lunch with a group of reporters that nothing has increased my sense of optimism that this new congress will be any better on this issue than the last one but the president , upbeat , would hear none of that he said the nation had a unique moment of opportunity now to reform the way american politics is financed he said he would meet with the congressional leadership next week to talk about that and about the budget he said he had been encouraged by what the republican leaders had had to say in the last few days he said he hoped to bring a top republican into his administration and he said only kind words about his vanquished opponent , bob dole , who concluded the campaign with daily denunciations of white house ethics , suggesting that mr dole still had contributions to make to government , perhaps soon no one asked mr clinton whether he thought he had properly handled the question of contributions from foreigners , which dominated the last 10 days of the contest , and he volunteered no opinion he and his staff essentially stonewalled until today , and the administration managed to keep john huang , the fundraiser at the center of the issue , safely away from reporters but a member of the cabinet said the white house analysis of polling data indicated that the controversy had cut deeply enough into the president s lead to hold him below 50 percent and to deny the democrats control of the house of representatives the president played down the bruises that remain after the roughandtumble of the campaign , although he insisted that by any reasonable standard , his tax increase was n't the biggest tax increase in history only once did he fix a questioner with that icyeyed gaze that denotes clintonian wrath that came when he was asked whether hillary rodham clinton had been told she was either the subject or a target of any of the investigations of kenneth w starr , the whitewater special prosecutor no , mr clinton said , his voice low but clearly audible then , even more subdued , he added the lawyerly qualifier , not to my knowledge the rest of the time , he was relaxed and occasionally jolly told that former secretary of state james a baker 3d had described his peacemaking mission to ireland as gullible s travels , the president replied , did he say that \? that s pretty good asked what he might have done to make the campaign more compelling so more people would have voted , he answered , i could have made it closer , maybe i do n't know donning his professorial mien , mr clinton gave an analysis of second presidential terms and their perils having recently read a book on the subject , he said , he has concluded that they fail for three reasons some external event disrupts them , a president thinks he has more of a mandate than he does and tries to do too much in the absence of cooperation or a president essentially just runs out of steam no 2 , of course , is the diagnosis of many students of mr clinton s troubles in 1993 and 1994 to avoid a disappointing second term of his own , the president said , he wanted to make it clear that we understand the american people want us to work with the republicans as he had in his electionnight speech , he talked of the need to build a vital center and promised to develop what he called a driving agenda criticized during the campaign for seeming to interfere in the work of the special prosecutor investigating the whitewater affair , mr clinton edged with exceeding care around the question of the appointment of an independent counsel to investigate allegations of improper democratic fund raising attorney general janet reno is weighing the matter , and he declined to say either whether he thought she should appoint a counsel or whether he would keep her on no comment , he answered at one point , in a piece of selfcontrol that bordered on heroism for a president who loves to talk and who talked for an hour and ten minutes at this news conference , his first in many months nor did he permit himself any criticism of the investigatory processes that have focused on his administration so far the accusations have hurt , and there are a lot of people who are troubled by this , he said , but i think that at least for the time being , it s not for me to be the one who s suggesting what should be done chart winners and losers lists percent of votes gained for the 1996 presidential election candidates \( pg a12 \)
moscow , oct 24 worried by russia s persistent failure to collect the taxes it needs to pay the costs of governing , the international monetary fund is expected to suspend further disbursement of a crucial 10 billion loan , officials said today the report that russia s central bank had failed to reach an agreement with the fund s experts was the latest sign that three months after president boris n yeltsin won reelection , chronic tax evasion has emerged as his most pressing political problem the growing roster of tax delinquents has forced the russian government to delay paying wages and pensions , causing mounting public anger it has also raised searching questions about mr yeltsin s ability to impose financial discipline and govern the vast russian state as a result of breakdown in talks between the bank and imf experts monitoring russia s compliance with the terms of its loan , the experts recommended that further disbursements of the threeyear loan be delayed if their recommendation is accepted by fund officials in washington , as expected , the fund will reevaluate russia s revenue in november to determine if the suspension of payments should be lifted the fund has already disbursed 24 billion of the loan the imf previously suspended disbursements in july because of concerns over falling revenue , only to restore the payments in august even without the dispute with the imf , tax arrears had emerged as a volatile issue , provoking angry charges by economic reformers and the communistdominated russian parliament in 1992 , the government collected taxes worth 165 percent of russia s gross national product tax revenues have steadily declined since then and averaged 85 percent of gnp in the first nine months of this year september was a particularly disastrous month for tax payments , economists say there is no single reason for tax evasion , officials said some companies , trapped by russia s new culture of nonpayment , have been holding off on their tax payments until they are paid by their creditors but big enterprises have also used political connections to obtain loopholes or ignore their tax obligations altogether there is no problem of tax collection or nonpayments in russia there is a problem of theft , yegor t gaidar , a former acting prime minister and a supporter of economic reforms , recently told the newspaper argumenty i fakty we have several dozen big enterprises that do not pay taxes each such company has connections they are powerful systems with their own people in the press , law enforcement bodies , tax inspectorate and tax police they pay money to the issue has broad social and political implications without sufficient revenue , the government has had to postpone paying wages and pensions that has added to the hardship among much of the russian population , set off unrest among workers and prompted worries about the political loyalty of the military kremlin officials say that they are taking action , but they concede that much more needs to be done finance minister aleksandr livshits recently told parliament that in the first nine months of this year the government collected only 71 percent of anticipated taxes , forcing it to consider spending cuts and anatoly b chubais , mr yeltsin s chief of staff , said that less than half of the taxes the government hoped to receive in october would actually be collected we must fully reverse the situation , mr chubais told the russian news agency , interfax seeking to send a tough message to tax dodgers , mr yeltsin has created a commission headed by prime minister viktor s chernomyrdin and mr chubais to supervise tax collection the commission had its first meeting this week , but has yet to focus on russia s largest tax dodgers rather , it has begun bankruptcy proceedings against four relatively small tax delinquents two automotive manufacturers , an aluminum producer and an oil refiner that collectively owe the government more than 100 million conspicuous by its omission was gazprom , the huge gas monopoly formerly headed by mr chernomyrdin its tax arrears approach 3 billion demonstrating selfconfidence bordering on arrogance , rem vya khirev , gazprom s chairman , recently sent a letter to members of parliament asserting that demands that gazprom pay back taxes were contrary to russia s interests the nation s financial health , mr vyakhirev wrote , cannot be achieved by squeezing dry a few structures that are still afloat mr vyakhirev argued that gazprom consumers , including state organizations , owe the company more than 9 billion the parliament has also compiled a list of the 73 largest corporate tax delinquents , who collectively owe the government some 49 billion complicating the situation , the government must spread the tax burden fairly and crack down on delinquents without stifling economic growth even before this year s presidential election , russia s problems in raising revnue were a growing worry but raising revenue meant resisting the temptation to make populist promises during the election season a restraint neither mr yeltsin nor the parliament exercised it also required closing tax loopholes and extracting taxes from powerful elites tax collection suffered badly before the election as powerful concerns waited to see who would win the worry now is that there has been a vast breakdown of discipline despite mr yeltsin s clear victory in the meantime , the shortfall has forced further retrenchments in government spending speaking to the parliament this week , mr livshits said none of the budget spending items were fully financed

fingertips with precision and purpose reggie miller was somewhere in phoenix playing the role of knick tormentor last night at madison square garden was terry dehere he scored 13 of his 15 points in the fourth quarter and led the los angeles clippers to a 10588 blowout victory it has come down to this for the knicks no team left on the schedule can be taken for granted absolutely no one not when you lose at home to the team with th fifthworst record in the national basketball association this is the worst loss of the season , said a demoralized patrick ewing , who scored 24 points , none in the fourth quarter as he , incredibly , took only one shot we 've hit the bottom of the barrel to lose to the clippers , i mean , they 're a talented team , but there s no way we should have lost tonight coach don nelson blamed himself , calling the loss embarrassing and an awful performance he watched the usual suspects commit some of the most painfully obvious crimes brad lohaus putting the ball on the floor charlie ward getting tied up for a jump ball and the heart of his depleted lineup ewing , anthony mason and derek harper sputtering in the fourth quarter john starks s tender right ankle swelled and forced him to stay in the locker room after halftime the team physician , norman scott , said starks aggravated the ankle sprain he sustained last wednesday he will make the team s trip to toronto today , and his status is daytoday the state of the knicks is much more grave they lost for the sixth time in their last seven games and have lost 9 of 12 since the allstar game break they are tied with cleveland for the no 4 seeding in the eastern conference with 24 games remaining never in control , the knicks \( 3325 \) had sliced a 10point , thirdquarter clipper lead to 7573 with 10 minutes 1 second left in the game after letting brent barry dazzle the crowd in the first half with his passing , they were finally moving the ball and their fickle fans were again behind them

rebounds the knicks , who do not do windows anymore , finished with 38 boards mason s 13 rebounds and 12 points were helpful , but not nearly enough many of the players disputed nelson s claim that there was not enough energy on the floor indicative of the communication between the coach and his team , harper simply looked up and said i'm not sure what he was talking about i'm never sure what s going on the 34yearold point guard finished with 6 points and 4 turnovers in 33 minutes the clippers won their 20th game of the season against 38 losses with simple basketball and key baskets down the stretch they overcame the stroke of hubert davis \( 25 points , 9of17 shooting \) by hitting 10 of 20 shots in the final period and forcing the knicks to get into their offensive sets with the shot clock winding down past 10 seconds the knicks came into the game having won five straight over the clippers and 17 of the last 19 their last loss came three years ago on a baseline jumper at the buzzer by the current knick gary grant in years past , we 've always kicked butts and took names here , ewing said after the knicks lost their 11th game this season at the garden right now , it s the other way around everybody got embarrassed today the players , coaches , the organization everybody rebounds they let the big one get away yesterday the 6foot11inch reserve center matt fish was not resigned to another 10day contract to make room for victor alexander on the team s 12man roster fish , who reported back to the fort wayne fury of the continental basketball association last night ,

merely a difference of opinion at a shootaround in purchase , ny , yesterday morning , nelson was matter of fact about the issue that has hampered his job he s angry and he has n't accepted the

giant , george stevens s epic film about a formidable texas ranching family challenged by changing times and the arrival of big oil , has been restored and will be rereleased on friday at the sony lincoln square in new york when it had its premiere in texas in 1956 , giant immediately chased all competition out of the state well before multiscreen cinemas or saturation booking , it opened in nine theaters in houston , six in fort worth , five in dallas and so on across the lone star state , packing and repacking the theaters as fast as tickets could be sold and popcorn popped texans devoured the film , along with the popcorn , just as they had devoured the distinctly slapdash book by edna ferber that served or disserved george stevens as a text how it is possible for blind love to fix itself on a visual artwork i do n't know , but it happened in texas when giant was released texans loved it , despite the fact that relentlessly , frame after frame , scene after scene , for 201 minutes , giant showed texans to be vain , greedy , violent , ignorant , bigoted and crude george stevens was in the midst of a crowning decade when he made giant , for which he won a bestdirector oscar \( the movie was nominated as well but lost to around the world in 80 days \) he began the decade with a place in the sun \( 1951 \) and ended it with the diary of anne frank \( 1959 \) giant came smack in the middle it cannot have been wholly congenial material for stevens , who was not by nature a satirist , yet the texans were such broad targets that a \( mostly gentle \) satire , woven around the luminous beauty of elizabeth taylor and the haunting brilliance of james dean , offered about the only way in stevens himself admitted that the title embarrassed him , pointing out that the movie was interested in small things that being the case , he should have hobbled the composer dimitri tiomkin , who seemed to think he was scoring the iliad on the other hand , one of the notsosmall themes the film tackles well ahead of its time is the constant mistreatment of hispanics i was 20 years old when giant opened being from a ranching family , i supposed i would find something in the movie i could relate to in the event , i did n't find much my father and his eight brothers each had ranches , but none of them singly nor all of them together remotely approached the scale of reata , the great ranch in the film bigranch texas was another world from ours i do remember , however , being embarrassed when the insensitive easterners who are to be bick benedict s \( rock hudson s \) inlaws keep asking him how much land he owns that s as rude , by texas standards , as questioning a texan s manhood the one landmark i immediately recognized in giant was the shamrock hotel \( central to the book , only hinted at in the film \) , which stood not far from rice university in houston , where i had been to school to a country boy such as i was , the shamrock seemed as monumental as a pyramid but the pyramids still stand , whereas the shamrock was demolished and removed in 1987 , after an existence of only 38 years in the 50 s , it was invariably referred to as glenn mccarthy s shamrock hotel or was until he lost it , along with his stratocruiser \( then the only one of these passenger planes in private hands and soon to be transferred to the even more private hands of howard hughes \) , his 200plus millions and , perhaps most regrettably , his sense of fun a reckless , deviltakethehindmost wildcatter s sense of fun , a variety in increasingly short supply in texas now that all the oilmen have been to yale glenn mccarthy still had his sense of fun in 1949 , when he opened the shamrock hotel on saint patrick s day , with a party that cost 15 million by way of contrast , truman capote s famous blackandwhite party at the plaza a decade and a half later cost only 15 , 000 the shindig at the shamrock was the most celebrated party ever given in texas , a gathering so extravagant that it authenticated everything rich texans liked to believe about themselves , or , for that matter , that poor texans liked to believe about rich texans my own guess is that texans loved giant because it reminded them of the glorious flamboyance that once existed in the state , a habit of thinking large that had ceased to be common even in 1956 in houston , a year after the film opened , silver dollar jim west died , a large , lonely houstonian who stuffed his oversized pockets with silver dollars , which he threw by the hundreds into public swimming pools for the kids to dive after jim west once gave an overnight party during the jolly course of which he had all his guests' cars repainted in his favorite shade of baby blue when he died , it took a small convoy of armored trucks to cart off the more than eight tons of silver dollars he had stashed in his basement you wo n't see the basses having that kind of fun , or ross perot , either , though it is mr perot not a cattle baron , not an oilman , not a chip baron , but an info baron who is the true heir of jett rink , the glenn mccarthy figure in giant , so brilliantly played by james dean unfortunately , mr perot s knobby , puritanical hubris led him into presidential politics rather than the construction of grand luxe hotels

las vegas , nev it happened first in california 15 years ago a housing boom touched off a litigation boom as legions of lawyers filed lawsuits accusing builders of shoddy workmanship now it is nevada s turn fueled by americans' gambling fever , las vegas and other nevada resort cities have seen dizzying economic and population growth the last decade and california lawyers who specialize in cases involving home construction defects , hit by a slump in their state s housing market , are practically drooling over the prospects next door they are taking the nevada bar exam at double the rate of three years ago and are aggressively wooing nevada property managers and homeowners associations ross feinberg , a lawyer in newport beach , calif , who has won 25 million in defect settlements for 21 california homeowners associations since 1986 , described nevada as a few years away from being as busy as we are here two of his associates were admitted to the nevada bar in october the rush of plaintiffs' lawyers into virgin territory to prospect for litigation gold whether in boomtowns , new products or fastgrowth companies is nothing new , of course but what makes the carpetbaggers' invasion of nevada different is that it is taking place at the height of a national backlash against the litigation explosion of recent years last december , congress enacted a law aimed at curbing frivolous classaction shareholder lawsuits in november , voters in bellwether california defeated 3 to 1 a measure supported by plaintiffs' lawyers that would have made it easier to bring such suits in cases involving stock fraud also last month , gov pete wilson of california called for limits on damages in disputes involving construction defects as the political climate shifts , nevada could join california in testing trial lawyers' resilience already , the forces aligned against them are formidable builders are threatening to stop building insurers are raising rates , and some homeowners are revolting against lawsuits being pursued in their names for now , though , the plaintiffs' lawyers seem undeterred , even cocky there s been such a vast amount of construction at a fever pace , nevada will be a good place to practice for years , said dave johnson , a las vegas lawyer whose clients are homeowners associations the lawyers , who typically take defect cases on contingency and get a third of any award , troll for clients at trade shows for condominium managers and put on slide shows , prodding homeowners associations to sue their builders several construction experts from san diego , who specialize in testifying in court , have obtained professional licenses in nevada and are considering opening satellite offices after attending a recent trade show , kathy d grimes , cofounder of a las vegas company that manages 130 condominium complexes , was deluged with boxes of cookies and other gifts sent by lawyers and participants we 've been in business 15 years , and we 've never had this kind of attention , she said such pitches are apparently paying off a year ago , only one of her clients was suing a developer , ms grimes said today , six are about a dozen construction defect cases are pending in clark county district court in las vegas , and lawyers say that is only the beginning of the wave of lawsuits that is expected that the california lawyers would focus on nevada was probably inevitable housing construction has plummeted in california , while nevada s exploding economy has produced an almost insatiable demand for it and the number of newhome sales in las vegas , one of america s fastestgrowing cities , with a population of nearly a million , has accelerated from 12 , 000 a decade ago to 27 , 000 last year to more than 23 , 000 in the first nine months of this year the blistering pace has earned las vegas the title city on steroids it has also resulted , some people say , in leaky roofs and other construction deficiencies terry strong , who bought a 380 , 000 lakeside home in a development northwest of the city in 1990 , says she dreads the summer thunderstorms that sweep across the 12 , 000foot spring mountains and onto the new subdivisions that blanket the desert plateau the wind sets off a kettle drum symphony from three unsecured sheetmetal chimney flues , she says , and the rain seeps through the tile roof and into the walls , ruining carpet , staining ceilings and warping windows she figures the repairs will cost 90 , 000 mrs strong , 52 , was not about to foot the bill nor would 11 neighbors who said they had similar problems last month , they settled a construction defect suit for 11 million with their builder s insurer but the story does not end there many residents of the development are furious at mrs strong and her fellow plaintiffs they believe the suit drove down property values , mrs strong said some are refusing to speak to her once you start this thing , you 're stuck with living with the problems , she added builders portray plaintiffs' lawyers as sharks out for a kill in california , many developers say they are pulling out of the condominium market because condo owners have the organizational and financial influence to undertake expensive lawsuits and they complain that they are at a particular disadvantage because california is one of the few states that holds them accountable for material variations from architects' plans or industry standards by any of their subcontractors , even if no damage results
canton , ohio there was jim harbaugh once again scrambling , darting , dancing , escaping the pass rush , whirling and throwing a fiveyard touchdown pass it was nullified by a penalty , but the indianapolis colts won anyway , 103 , over the new orleans saints in the annual hall of fame game here last saturday the off season was a scrambling , darting and dancing one for harbaugh , too he escaped the criticism he often hears during those months when you have led the league in passing with a 1007 rating \( only 15 quarterbacks in the league s 76year history have reached 100 \) , when you have earned your first pro bowl honors and topped troy aikman , steve young and dan marino , when you have topped all quarterbacks as harbaugh did last season , well , even your most stern detractors take note he is 32 now he is preparing for his 10th pro season there were those seven rocky years with the chicago bears that tested his confidence and his football future , but last season he found redemption in indianapolis and just what has happened to harbaugh since he led the colts to the playoffs , to the american conference championship game and one big play away from reaching super bowl xxx \? he was married while at the pro bowl in honolulu , and he and his wife , miah , are expecting a son in late september he held his annual camp for high school football players at western kentucky university , where his father , jack , is head coach at an auction there , he raised more than 40 , 000 for the program he competed in the national football league quarterback challenge in orlando , fla he signed a oneyear deal with the colts for 4 million there is , however , one place where harbaugh enjoyed his success most i went to a garth brooks concert in indianapolis and i got a chance to meet with him for about 20 minutes before the show , harbaugh said excitedly i can communicate pretty well , but there i was and i was stunned with him i did n't know what to say , but he was such a gracious man i gave him two colts jerseys , one with his name on the back and one with my number and name on it and in the concert he says 'tonight before the show i got a special gift , my own colts jersey with my name on it but tonight i'm proudest to wear this' and he rips off his shirt and he is wearing the jersey with harbaugh on it i was floored it was one of the top five nights of my life is this where the party ends for harbaugh \? in the 1996 nfl season does he go back to being a scrambler first and a passer second \? was last season a fluke \? is he really anywhere near the talent of aikman or young or marino \? that is one of the more intriguing questions about nfl '96 and it makes the colts one of the more intriguing teams in harbaugh , the colts have a competitor second to none he has absorbed the bumps and bruises , from the high of being a firstround bears pick in 1987 to the low of being waived by the bears in march 1994 , and he has turned that into something positive he is a true example of the complexities and growing pains that most young nfl quarterbacks trudge through he is a rare example of one who has staying power , who can mix experience with talent and desire to finish on top this is a quarterback with supreme mobility , good accuracy , good decisionmaking , careful passing and one who is respected by his peers and his coaches you do n't give a guy the kind of money and commitment we gave jim unless you believe in him , said colts coach lindy infante we do n't think he was a oneyear splash we expect him to be even better this season my job will be to always remind him that he does n't have to do it all by himself the new harbaugh is much like the old one to his father i 've watched him as a pro in all nine seasons , jack harbaugh said he was with the bears in the playoffs for three seasons his confidence was eroded from the way things went with chicago , but i do n't think this is a new jim now he has a defense , a running game , the total package to work with they 've got a plan in indy and an executor harbaugh and in infante s system , harbaugh can flourish again it is an offensive system of multiple formations designed to quickly exploit defensive weaknesses it is flexible we 've got every play in the playbook known to man , harbaugh said and it relies on his mobility , quick thinking and playmaking the colts' defense will have a major impact on harbaugh it is a defense that is young and strong , especially in the secondary , and it produces turnovers more chances for harbaugh i remember my first year with the bears and how walter payton and dan hampton were there and how i went up to them and told them i grew up watching them when i was in high school , harbaugh said now guys come to me and say that and it is a strange feeling i 've never been more excited going into a season this is the first time in five years that i will play in the same offensive system for the second consecutive year we 've had some success as a team and once you 've had it , you want to experience that taste again it all boils down to winning close games that will probably decide our season that and the new jim harbaugh , who , in reality , is simply the best of the old one photo jim harbaugh found redemption in a spectacular season with thecolts \( associated press \)
the middle heart by bette bao lord 370 pp new york alfred a knopf 25 the historian w j f jenner has said that china is caught in a prison of history he suggests that there is no escape from the past , that even the chinese language which can describe a situation today , last year and 2 , 000 years ago in identical linguistic forms traps the culture and people in the stagnant , and often violent , ways of the past mr jenner posits that this adherence to the old led inevitably to the events at tiananmen square in the spring of 1989 bette bao lord , the chineseborn wife of a former united states ambassador to china , has carved out an interesting career by bringing china and the lives of the chinese to american readers in a variety of forms she wrote in the year of the boar and jackie robinson , a fictionalized account of her childhood as an immigrant in brooklyn , as a children s book she told the story of her younger sister , who was left behind with an aunt in china because she was too young to travel , and became separated from the rest of the family when the bamboo curtain came down , in the biography eighth moon her popular novel spring moon appealed to lovers of historical fiction , telling a story that spanned five generations legacies was a series of essays and firstperson narratives on the events leading up to the tiananmen square massacre her new novel , the middle heart , draws on her facility with all these genres it is a compelling and admirably accurate history of china over the last 75 years , lightly disguised as a conventional multigenerational love story in 1932 , the year of the japanese conquest of manchuria , steel hope , the spoiled son of the patriarch of the house of li , and mountain pine , a physically lame but academically brilliant servant , befriend firecrackers , a wild orphan girl masquerading as a boy they become blood brothers , pledging to die in defense of their country over the next 50 years , the three companions are separated , thrown into disgrace and left for dead , fall in love with the wrong people and spend a decade here and there in solitary confinement they also survive the invasion by the japanese , the civil war , attacks on rightists , the madness of the cultural revolution and , finally , the tragedy of tiananmen square at times , the middle heart seems hopelessly obvious in 1940 , in the nationalist wartime capital of chongqing , steel hope and mountain pine the former now an engineering student , the latter an aspiring writer go to the opera to see a beautiful actress , summer wishes she turns out to be none other than firecrackers after the revolution , when the communist party man arrives in the old ancestral village where summer wishes and mountain pine are happily married , guess who that turns out to be to some readers these coincidences will seem implausible , but they should reconsider in times of turmoil , which china has certainly had its share of during the last threequarters of a century , does n't it make sense that the same groups of people \( the elite , intellectuals , artists \) would repeatedly run into one another struggling to return to their homes , seeking solace in exile , languishing in labor camps \? ultimately , it is this dramatic aspect of the middle heart that makes it so readable in fact , mrs lord has given her fictional story a good deal of authenticity by using small details telling nuggets of fact from her interviews for legacies in the middle heart , steel hope , released from 10 years in solitary confinement , is able to pace only four steps in one direction and back again this anecdote comes directly from the opening page of legacies , where mrs lord tells the story of a former prisoner she met in beijing mountain pine , after years of forced labor , loses his temper when someone wastes half a glass of water mrs lord found this detail when she asked some chinese children how prison had changed their mother when another character in this novel is tied into the takeoff position arms twisted and tied up and back to a board as a means of humiliation and pain during the cultural revolution mrs lord is using an experience she has elsewhere described as happening to her own aunt as each of mrs lord s characters is forced to renounce loved ones , political beliefs , even his or her own morals to survive , it is important to remember that few people in china reached the 1990 s without making some similar sacrifices in the late 1950 s , mountain pine , declared a rightist , encourages his wife to divorce him so that their son will not be disgraced once i'm sent away , he tells summer wishes , no one must ever speak of me again , so that little panda will learn not to talk about his father since my existence can only harm him , i must cease to exist during the cultural revolution , in the 1960 s , summer wishes , now married to steel hope , must beat her husband before hundreds of people as he whispers encouragement , she addresses the crowd i know this filthy revisionist better than anyone these scenes may seem melodramatic to american readers , but they were played out again and again in real life by people who were just trying to outlast the latest political upheaval at the end , a granddaughter , north star , goes to take part in the demonstration at tiananmen square she recalls the words summer wishes kept repeating at her death i wanted to be a human being bette bao lord has taken the modern history of a quarter of the world s population and turned it into the story of human beings surviving against tremendous adversity the middle heart is a moving tribute to the chinese people and their capacity to endure and , despite all , hope
washington , nov 2 after all the hand wringing about a selfdescribed redneck running foreign policy , senator jesse helms s chairmanship of the senate foreign relations committee has produced surprising little of substance beyond the helmsburton bill on cuba , disappointing republican conservatives and providing a source of some relief to president clinton the jesse helms who took over the committee after the republicans won control of the senate in 1994 and warned that president clinton better have a bodyguard if he visited military bases in north carolina has proved to be a far less threatening manager of the committee s business of diplomatic appointments and oversight , clinton administration officials say when mr helms took control of the committee , republicans and democrats thought he might use his chairmanship as effectively as the late sen william fullbright , a democrat of arkansas , who forced changes in administration policy during the vietnam war through highprofile committee hearings and aggressive use of the committee s investigative powers but mr helms , a north carolina republican , failed in his gunsblazing effort to mandate a reorganization of the state department or to articulate a serious republican alternative to mr clinton s oftenhaphazard foreign policy the committee did perform the routine work of confirming top diplomatic appointments and overseeing legislation however , for the first time in many years , the committee failed to get a state department authorization bill passed into law , ceding responsibility on this issue and on foreign aid to the appropriations committee even helmsburton , which codifies the united states embargo of cuba and denies entry into the united states of any person benefiting from american property confiscated by havana , was something of an accident the bill was dead before cuba shot down two civilian airplanes in late february , and mr clinton grabbed the issue its quick passage and signature into law on march 12 were a reflection more of mr clinton s eagerness to turn his own positions 180 degrees in the interest of reelection and florida s electoral votes than of mr helms s legislative acumen instead , mr helm and his committee have been criticized for concentrating on the small issues like the fate of american properties abroad as one republican staff membersaid for conservative republicans , he s been a serious disappointment everybody knows there s gridlock , but you ca n't stick amendments onto legislation if you do n't get any passed the staff is seriously arrogant and limited all they really do is the budget the amount of time spent investigating former american villas in nicaragua is incredible , when there are real issues out there ultimately , the republican party or the twoparty system are n't served that way james w \( bud \) nance , a retired rear admiral who is mr helms s chief of staff and a boyhood friend , admits that he and the senator have made mistakes in both judgment and tactics none of us is satisfied , mr nance said due to democratic and white house opposition , he said , we did n't pass a state authorization bill or a foreign operation bill , and it s a disgrace mr nance and a spokesman for mr helms , marc thiessen , pointed out that quick legislative accomplishments in the senate are rare , given the need to get 60 votes to end debate on any issue but they contended that mr helms had won the intellectual debate on issues ranging from state department reorganization and the prominence of taiwan to decertifying colombia for narcotics corruption , arming the bosnian muslims and helping to hold off a vote to ratify the chemical weapons convention , and that he would continue to make these issues prominent in the new congress that presumes that senator helms , now 75 , wins a tight race in north carolina on tuesday and that the republicans , as expected , preserve a narrow majority in the senate but mr helms , who declined an interview request , is determined to play a responsible role , mr nance said we did n't feel that republican revolution stuff over here , he said we 'd like to see a real bipartisan foreign policy it is the clinton white house that has been so partisan , mr thiessen said helms reached out his hand to them on reorganization and they slapped him , and that set the tone senator hank brown , a colorado republican and committee member who is retiring , said mr helms had been a welcome surprise to many when republicans were the minority , helms was very effective at stopping things , he said but while he is a fierce advocate of his philosophy , he combines that with a genial and courtly nature he has done a reasonable job of getting nominees out , and he s been less controversial than expected people are surprised democratic members of the committee staff say they are indeed surprised at mr helms s inactivity , in part because of his effort , one said , to appear more mainstream no staff member was willing to be identified , saying their jobs were at risk
when gen barry r mccaffrey talks about an unraveling of physical and spiritual wellbeing in the united states army , he refers not to wartime vietnam , where he pulled two combat tours and was badly wounded , but to peacetime germany during the 1970 s , in a military garrison ravaged by drug and alcohol abuse i do n't mean to sound like a moralist , but i was a serving infantry officer in germany and the impact on us was devastating , said general mccaffrey , who related incidents of gang rape , vandalism and other problems in troop discipline and it was fundamentally the result of drug use and alcohol it took the army more than seven years , he said , to win its battle with illegal drugs and alcoholism , discharging soldiers who would not stay sober , finding treatment for others willing to shake their addiction and the rest of us stood together , general mccaffrey recalled in an interview , and said , 'look , no more , not on our watch' today , as he tells it , the armed forces are essentially drugfree for all his determination , general mccaffrey , who is 53 , may now be facing an even more daunting task as the new drug czar the head of the nation s campaign against drugs he assumes control of a white house office frayed by official neglect , one that has seldom been taken seriously by the giant agencies that enforce drug laws present and former lawenforcement officials , some speaking on condition of anonymity , said that until now , the drug czar was regarded as little more than a political appointee without much influence in important policy discussions i see it more as a bully pulpit than as an office that can get things done , said robert h silbering , the special narcotics prosecutor for new york city , because how does the drug czar tell janet reno how the justice department should fight drugs \? the coordination of all the government s programs to fight drugs would be very difficult for anyone the general s appointment also comes as critics are raising more questions about the effectiveness of the government s muchheralded war on drugs mr silbering , who agreed that someone of general mccaffrey s stature was needed in the white house , said , what we 've had in the past is a very unfocused and uncoordinated effort to deal with a very complex problem the office of national drug control policy , which general mccaffrey heads , was created with great fanfare in 1988 to coordinate the antidrug budgets of 50 government departments and agencies not surprisingly , they balked at having their priorities secondguessed by an outsider the whole notion that someone could be a drug czar simply reflects ignorance of how the american government works , said prof mark a r kleiman , a drugpolicy expert at harvard university in 1993 , president clinton slashed the size of the office to 25 employees from 146 , to fulfill a campaign pledge to reduce the overall white house staff by 25 percent last december , the previous drug czar , lee a brown , the former new york city police commissioner , resigned to teach at rice university in houston after the budget was cut for the office by most accounts , general mccaffrey insisted upon genuine authority as a condition of taking the job , a cabinetlevel position mr clinton promptly asked him to find ways to spend an additional 250 million , reallocated from the pentagon , on top of the government s total antidrug budget of 145 billion for this fiscal year the general has also been invited to look at next year s budget the general , who was sworn in early this month , has consolidated his authority quickly he announced on friday that he would lead a delegation to mexico on march 26 to discuss with president ernesto zedillo how to stem the flow of drugs from mexico to the united states he also said mr clinton was creating a cabinet council on the antidrug effort yet , general mccaffrey , who has gained a place in national security council meetings , sees himself not as the commanding general of a national offensive against illegal drugs but as the team s quarterback , calling the signals on which programs work best it does n't take much to understand how important the issue is , he said it s clearly not an overstatement to say that abuse of illegal drugs and alcohol is at the root of the majority of the serious social challenges this country faces general mccaffrey , the son of a general , seems driven by the notion of service to god and country he says he is a good catholic lad and wears his large west pointer s ring jammed against the narrow wedding band on his left hand but he also comes across as shrewd and accustomed to getting his way as a freshly retired fourstar general , which means wringing enough resources from the white house and congress for his new effort general mccaffrey knows a war when he sees one , first in vietnam and more recently in the persian gulf , where he led the 24th mechanized infantry division so it seemed remarkable that during an hourlong interview in his washington office , he avoided the cliche of a war on drugs the analogy of cancer is far more adaptive and useful as a model to a way of thinking and talking about the problem , the general said war , he said , was focused violence directed toward an achievable end , with a unity of command and element of surprise none of those associated military concepts are useful to us talking and thinking about this problem , but cancer probably is , he said he talked of dealing with the root causes of drug abuse , treating the pain and preserving the dignity of those afflicted the effort , he said , means staying the course what we 've got to understand is , this is n't a campaign of a year , general mccaffrey said this is a social challenge that we 've got to stand up to as a matter of principle and keep in progress , because it s not going to go away law enforcement is very important , he said , but that s not how we 're going to solve the problem we need treatment , prevention addicts who are in prison or on probation need treatment , he said , to avoid committing new crimes the general avoided specifics about his plans , but he said , it seems to me our no 1 responsibility is to youth , and that means drug prevention republicans , who have criticized the white house s antidrug efforts as pallid , have been vying with the president to show support for general mccaffrey when mr clinton recently requested 34 million to augment the current 75 million budget for the office , senator orrin g hatch , republican of utah , raised the amount by 500 , 000 the senate unanimously agreed general mccaffrey plans to increase the size of the office to about 150 employees , its level under the first drug czar , william j bennett the general is also borrowing as many as 30 military planners and other specialists from the pentagon to help him devise a systemic approach to the drug problem what i'm going to be is the intellectual quarterback of the president s team in the federal government that tries to coordinate and articulate solutions , general mccaffrey said and that s going to be a big job , and i'm going to do it with ferocious concentration , and hopefully with some success photo gen barry r mccaffrey , left , and an aide , leaving the whitehouse after a meeting with the president \( stephen crowley

washington , dec 29 having orchestrated the ouster of boutros boutrosghali as secretary general of the united nations , the clinton administration is facing increased diplomatic pressure to pay america s outstanding united nations dues but the republicans who control congress are resisting as the administration worked to block mr boutrosghali s reelection this month , it argued that only the presence of a new secretary general could persuade congress to pay the hundreds of millions of dollars that the united states has owed for three years but republicans insist that they have no intention of repaying the debt until they are convinced that the newly elected secretary general , kofi annan , will make a difference mr annan , they say , must persuade them in a way his predecessor never did that he is determined to streamline the organization s budget and bureaucracy as marc a thiessen , the spokesman for jesse helms , chairman of the senate foreign relations committee , put it they thought if they just brought us boutrosghali s head on a platter , that it would satiate us and we 'd pay up our concern is not boutrosghali , but whether the united nations reforms itself for the united states , the back dues have become a nagging diplomatic embarrassment even administration officials acknowledge that the issue has undercut american credibility at the united nations , while pushing the organization to the brink of fiscal disarray in a farewell speech to the general assembly this month , mr boutrosghali scolded the united states for not paying up as has been promised so often delegates have delivered rebukes on the assembly floor and last month , the united states was thrown off the committee that oversees the organization s budget a senior administration official said that although the united states had withheld dues to encourage reforms , the unpaid balance had created a backlash , provoking resistance to american proposals and eroding support for the very changes that washington hopes to see it has caused significant problems in the last several years , the official said and it has intensified as president clinton prepared to submit his budget recommendations to congress next month , officials said the administration would propose paying the debt in installments the proposal is similar to one that congress rejected last year , to pay over five years difficult negotiations remain , not only with congress but also with the united nations even the extent of the debt remains in dispute , with the united nations insisting that the united states owes 13 billion and the administration arguing that the amount is less than 1 billion we remain optimistic that we 're going to square this problem away within the next 12 months , said princeton n lyman , the acting assistant secretary of state for international organization affairs it s not going to be easy , though the administration s handling of the search for a secretary general , which many diplomats considered unabashed bullying , stoked a bitterness that was simmering at the united nations for years and it has created a feeling that now more than ever , the united states is obliged to pay its full dues speaking on condition of anonymity , one united nations official said , i think it will be extremely damaging to the clinton administration if they ousted boutrosghali and supported kofi annan , then were unable to deliver the goods on payments the organization s budget officials say the american debt constitutes more than half of its 23 billion in outstanding dues nearly half of the 185 members owe at least some money , but the united states , the largest contributor , owes the most by far the nextlargest debtors are russia , which owes 266 million , and ukraine , which owes 252 million in addition , the united states owes more than 300 million in dues to united nations agencies like the world health organization and the international labor organization joseph e connor , an american who is the united nations under secretary general for administration and management , said washington s failure to pay its dues had strained the organization to the brink , forcing it to borrow from the peacekeeping funds for operating expenses critics in congress often argue that withholding dues forces the united nations to squeeze what they say is its bloated bureaucracy but a result has been a delay in reimbursing the countries contributing troops and equipment to peacekeeping operations , among them some of the united states' strongest allies , like britain and france it s a very precarious financial situation , mr connor said each year the united states is required to pay its dues , an assessment that totals 25 percent of the organization s operating budget in the current fiscal year , the assessment came to 321 million of the total of 13 billion the united nations also assesses the united states a 31 percent share of the peacekeeping budget , which this year is 434 million of a total of 14 billion , according to the united nations but since the 1980 s , the united states has periodically built up back dues totaling hundreds of millions of dollars before repaying
west orange , nj , april 5 jacques lemaire put extreme pressure on his players right from opening day to practice the rigid defensive tactics that helped the devils win the stanley cup last year but with nine days remaining in the regular season , it appears that lemaire s philosophy may have backfired because the devils are on the verge of missing the playoffs the devils' situation became even more tenuous thursday night when they lost , 10 , to the hartford whalers , a nonplayoff team , and remained one spot out of the playoff race in the eastern conference with five games remaining , the devils are 2 points behind the eighthplace tampa bay lightning , which lost to the buffalo sabres , 43 , tonight we 're desperate now , said the devils' captain , scott stevens there is no margin for error struggling to score , the devils are in a desperate search for goals and victories , beginning with saturday s return match against the whalers in hartford in his first two seasons as coach , everything lemaire did in the regular season was geared toward the playoffs in the spring and was met with complete approval from his players they accepted the defensive tactics lemaire imposed and were rewarded handsomely with the stanley cup last season but the sacrifice that led to that championship came in a shortened season as a result of a labor dispute between the owners and the players union the players could grin and bear it for the short duration of the regular season , then ride it through the playoffs lemaire applied the defensive strategy again this season , but over a full season the toll on the players is greater there is a sense among them that the game is not as much fun as it could be , and one player said that almost every game was like the seventh game of a playoff series players such as stephane richer and john maclean , two performers with offensive flair who have scored clutch goals in their career , were asked to play defense first and foremost the flamboyant richer failed to obey a few times and found himself sitting on the bench for long stretches richer had two 50goal seasons with montreal and maclean had three seasons with 40 or more goals and a 37goal output in lemaire s first season as coach with defense as their primary responsibility , maclean has 18 goals this season and richer has 20 no wonder the devils have scored 2 goals or fewer in 39 of their games this season one of the reasons they are on the verge of missing the playoffs is that they have scored one goal or none in the last three games the 10 loss to hartford on thursday night was their third in a row , making the remaining five games extremely important there is a lot of pressure around here , said steve thomas , who joined the devils this season and leads the team in goals with 25 but when we win tomorrow , thomas said with a smile , we 'll get some rejuvenation and take it from there

to the editor re ending farm welfare \( editorial , feb 4 \) consider that on feb 1 , a farmer could have contracted to sell his crop on the futures market for a price well above the target price set in the farm programs this means that because the market price is higher than the target price , the farmer would not be eligible for a subsidy payment from taxpayers yet under the freedom to farm bill , none of this matters the farmer would sign a contract with the government and receive a fixed payment over the next seven years whether prices are high or not , costing taxpayers 36 billion you seem to accept this as the means by which we can achieve normalizing the industry by 2002 that assumes that future congresses will not prolong the freedom to farm transition this is n't a sound assumption , considering that the present programs were started 60 years ago as a temporary solution to an emergency we need a program that is a true safety net and prevents widespread bankruptcies but that does n't prop up profits that ca n't be supported by the market it would also be wise to make a commitment to research that will maintain the competitiveness of united states farmers this bill does none of that calvin m dooley washington , feb 5 , 1996 member of congress , 20th dist , calif the writer is a member of the house agriculture committee
to the editor that the jobs issue has come to the fore in a republican primary shows the extent to which mainstream democratic politicians and pundits have been living in a world far removed from that of ordinary citizens it is true that the public , depending on media preoccupations , may get temporarily excited about the national debt , welfare , crime in the streets or even flagburning however , most voters have realized , long before it penetrated inside the beltway , that jobs had become less secure and have paid less than in earlier years none of the benefits of improvements in productivity for the past 20 years have gone to the lower 80 percent of families it is sad indeed that it had to be pat buchanan who made this a burning issue william f schreiber cambridge , mass , feb 21 , 1996

arlington , tex , oct 3 joe torre owes managerinwaiting , jim leyland , and former fatherinhiding , george boehringer , a telephone call or a telegram of thanks those two disparate personalities were unexpectedly involved in helping the yankees save their season , at least for now , with a 54 victory over the texas rangers in a dramatic and draining 12inning game that ended early this morning in new york charlie hayes , a pupil , and brian boehringer , a son , were very instrumental , too simple execution ended a complicated game that could have complicated matters for torre if the yankees had not climbed back from a 41 hole in game 2 to even the division series , 11 , the yankees and their manager would have surely been facing elimination at the ballpark in arlington this weekend they knew it and they did something about it well , at 02 you just go down there and you just hope for something crazy to happen , paul o'neill said at 11 , we got a series simple things made it so like hayes s perfectly placed sacrifice bunt with runners on first and second and none out in the yankee 12th that eventually won the game like boehringer s perfect onebatter outing with the bases loaded and two out in the texas 12th that helped keep the game tied hayes s bunt to third base was picked up off the wet grass by dean palmer , and when the throw was bounced past first base , derek jeter scored the decisive run from second base in the top of the inning , boehringer had ambled into a stickier situation and immediately challenged palmer with fastballs , dousing the texas threat on a tricky fly ball to rightcenter field that o'neill leaped to snatch , inches in front of bernie williams every pitch was important , jeter said the crowd was into it every little thing meant something the same scenario should be true friday night in game 3 , when jimmy key , who is 02 with an 817 earned run average against texas this season , opposes lefthander darren oliver , who was 10 and 257 versus the yankees torre canceled today s workout because the yankees , who were 2027 against lefthanded starters this season , arrived here at 5 30 am but they were working to diminish the ghosts of arlington , where they have dropped 10 of their 13 games at the ballpark while the names have changed since 1989 , the yankees have lost 34 of their last 43 games in texas another gamelosing error by the best defensive team in the major leagues , like palmer s in game 2 , should not be counted on i think guys are up for the challenge , key said i think we 're all professionals and we enjoy that i enjoy playing in hostile places i feed off that i love that key sounded convincing well , sort of you have to put that stuff out of your mind because you have to play here , torre said simple things conspired to inspire the yankees in game 2 like a manager hovering over a veteran player every morning in spring training and reminding him of the importance of bunting that was the scene involving leyland and hayes when both were with the pittsburgh pirates this season or like a father reminding his son that his employers might be losing patience with his inconsistent performances in the majors that scene starred the boehringers and now includes brian s song of redemption i have to praise jim leyland for watching me every day , said hayes , whom the yankees acquired from the pirates on aug 30 , a month before leyland officially resigned as pittsburgh manager he kept saying you never knew when you might have to bunt i never bunted so much in my life boehringer heeded his father s advice and said he had one goal when the yankees summoned him in the second half of the season after a soso first half i did n't want to embarrass my dad as much he watches the games on satellite john wetteland , who presides over the bullpen and considers boehringer one of his disciples , boasted after game 2 he was tremendous i must have told them five times that he was the man actually , several heroes were scattered round the yankee clubhouse from hayes , who made torre look shrewd by pinchhitting for wade boggs and contributing a sacrifice fly in the seventh to boehringer , who was the winning pitcher to jeter , who had three hits and started the winning rally with a single in the 12th to wetteland , who tossed two tense and scoreless innings to mariano rivera , who retired all eight batters he faced to cecil fielder , who homered off ken hill in the fourth and singled off jeff russell in the eighth to tie the game , 44 to the bullpen , which limited the rangers to four hits for five and twothirds innings , to torre , who could send himself a thankyou note for his swift strategical moves that worked we were never dead , darryl strawberry said we never felt like we were out of it we feel we 're in it no matter what the yankees tiptoed around some minefields after the rangers put a runner on third with two out against wetteland in the 10th the dangerous juan gonzalez , who had bashed two homers off andy pettitte , was the batter even the 57 , 165 fans realized the yankees had to walk gonzalez and face the lefthandedhitting will clark they did and it worked as clark looped a fly to right field after two singles and kenny rogers s fourpitch walk to clark filled the bases in the 12th , torre called upon boehringer and the rookie secured the final out i did everything i had to win this game , torre said we had to win this game call it the fifth game , the seventh game of the world series or anything you want that s the way i managed this game torre could not even avoid the slugging gonzalez on an off day while the yankee manager was having breakfast this morning , gonzalez , who is hitting 522 with 8 homers and 23 runs batted in in 12 games against new york this season , was dining in the same restaurant supposedly , the special was yankee pot roast i was going to have him pick up my check , torre joked , or poison his food inside pitch it is logical to expect the yankees to pitch around juan gonzalez or walk him for the rest of the series i think we 'll do it , jimmy key said he s got outs in his bats just like everyone else you 'll see us walk him when joe torre used charlie hayes as a pinchhitter for wade boggs against lefthander dennis cook in the seventh inning , he was unfazed over withdrawing the future hall of famer he did it during the regular season and will again you try to manage the game and not the name , torre said everybody s aware of what i'm trying to do photos with both teams flying into texas in the earlymorning hours , there was no practice yesterday but andy pettitte , the yankees' starter in game 2 , loosened up \( associated press \) \( pg b9 \) joe torre removing reliever graeme lloyd from

the federal aviation administration s belated decision to ground valujet airlines as a safety hazard amounts to an admission of how wrongheaded the agency had been in its previous efforts to regulate the troubled lowcost airline five weeks ago the faa administrator , david hinson , and transportation secretary federico pena rashly assured the public that valujet was safe to fly one day after one of its planes crashed in the florida everglades now they have been forced to acknowledge that valujet is not up to standards , and mr hinson has acknowledged that the faa s inspections were not adequate to assure the airworthiness of valujet s fleet both mr hinson and mr pena , while maintaining that their earlier statements were based on the best information then available to them , have at last taken the first necessary steps toward mending the faa s ways and insuring the safety of the flying public even before the may 11 crash the faa had catalogued a spate of valujet mishaps , none causing fatalities , that added up to an accident rate well above the industry s average federal investigations turned up maintenance and other problems , but the faa judged them not serious enough to ground the airline yet now , over the five weeks since the crash , investigators have exposed maintenance problems so severe that the faa no longer regards valujet as safe to fly the obvious question , which congress will no doubt pose when it opens hearings next week , is why the precrash investigations failed to uncover the severity of the problems mr hinson admitted yesterday that faa inspections do not adequately track carriers that contract out most of their maintenance to outside companies he pledged to correct the weakness for his part , secretary pena will go to congress to ask for a change in the faa s mission so that it is responsible only for safety and not the economic health of the carriers this is a crucial reform that will relieve the agency of its divided loyalties between the carriers and the public and increase the credibility of its declarations mr hinson also , in effect , dismissed his chief safety official , anthony broderick , though congress may want to check whether mr broderick has been scapegoated to take the heat off the rest of the organization congress should also inquire whether , as many outside experts have determined , the faa needs additional inspectors valujet announced yesterday its intention to return to the air next month but for that to happen , the faa must first spruce up its inspection procedures so that unsafe practices never again go undetected or uncorrected last month s crash is still under investigation , and its cause is not yet definitely known yet the crash exposed serious problems in both the faa and valujet yesterday the faa took the first curative steps whether valujet follows suit will determine whether it ever flies again
a skirmish between the putnam fund group and lipper analytical services is yielding a brandnew category for closedend funds preferredstock funds the new category , listed for the first time in today s closedend fund tables , is a result of a battle waged by the putnam fund group on behalf of its dividend income fund , which putnam contended had been inappropriately listed among specialized equity funds it had a point , because specialized equity was something of a grabbag category , including a wide range of funds perhaps most important , the putnam fund s performance looked anemic compared with most of the funds on the list the putnam fund invests in preferred stock , and thus acts much like a bond fund , whereas some specialized equity funds invest in health care stocks or in bank shares so in july , putnam told lipper analytical services , which compiles the closedend fund table for the new york times and other major newspapers , that it would no longer supply the net asset value of the fund to lipper and for two weeks , newspaper readers could not learn how the fund s assets had performed a spokeswoman for putnam said it felt lipper was being unfair in its comparisons lipper said it was surprised by putnam s complaint and its decision not to supply the data as for depriving the investors of information about the fund , the putnam spokeswoman said , shareholders who wanted to know the net asset value could call putnam to obtain it they just could not read it in the newspaper after two weeks , putnam began providing the figure again but only after it received a promise from lipper to start the new category the putnam dividend income fund is designed for corporate buyers , who can benefit from the fact that corporations pay taxes on only a part of the dividend income they receive from other corporations the fund buys preferred stocks , some with fixed dividends and some with dividends that adjust based on changes in market interest rates so how does the putnam fund compare now with other preferredstock funds none of which had evidently felt outraged about being included in the larger group \? not especially well either measured by the performance of its net asset value the value of the securities owned by the fund it was up 026 percent during the first seven months of this year that ranks fifth of the seven preferredstock funds that may not sound great , but it is an improvement from its ranking for longer periods over the 12 months through the end of july , it ranked seventh , or last , with a 535 percent gain in its net asset value over the 24 months through july , it also was in last place , with a total gain of 1158 percent like all closedend funds , the putnam fund trades every day , in its case on the new york stock exchange so owners can see what their shares are trading for in those tables each day but closedend funds report the underlying value of shares they own only once a week , after the close of trading on friday the table in the times shows the discount , or premium , to net asset value of the market price of each fund like most closedend funds , the putnam dividend income fund usually trades at a small discount to the net asset value
daytona beach , fla , feb 15 dale earnhardt and ernie irvan today won their 125mile qualifying races for the daytona 500 on sunday , proving that although teamwork is fine at pit stops , it is every man for himself on the last lap at the daytona international speedway the two earnhardt in a chevy monte carlo and irvan in a ford thunderbird had clinched the two frontrow spots for the daytona 500 on saturday , with earnhardt on the pole but the two 50lap races today set the rest of the 43car lineup , as well as allowing the contenders to see how they run in traffic neither contest today represented a complete picture of how sunday may go , because the 51 potential starters were split between the two races irvan , who led every lap of his race , fought off ken schrader and his teammate jeff gordon , who tried to team up on the final lap and draft past him schrader finished second , and gordon was fourth it did not hurt that irvan had some drafting help at the finish from john andretti , who was third in a thunderbird in the first race earnhardt held off sterling marlin , the twotime defending daytona champion , who received little drafting help from anyone , and the thirdplace finisher , terry labonte earnhardt led 21 laps , and marlin the other 29 it was the seventh consecutive victory in a daytona 500 qualifying race for earnhardt , who has never won the big prize in 17 attempts everybody s talking about teammates , earnhardt said after the race , referring to the widespread multicar teams it s going to get real competitive this year racing two cars per team or three cars per team versus racing one on one what helped earnhardt was that marlin , like earnhardt , makes up a onedriver team and that labonte was separated from schrader and gordon , his teammates dale jarrett , fourth behind labonte , will be reunited with his teammate irvan on sunday , too but irvan discounted team loyalties as well as a possibility that ford drivers would team up against chevy drivers when we go out here racing , irvan said , it does n't matter whether you 're in a ford or a chevrolet you 're all trying for first irvan , who almost died in a racing crash in august 1994 , seems fully recovered i feel real fortunate that none of my skills have left , he said none of the top drivers will miss the race on sunday , although rusty wallace , who usually finishes poorly here , will start 43d and last , after having nearly crashed in the second race today
the general manager of the atlanta braves , the awful atlanta braves , went to a pay phone outside the ball park in colorado springs and called one of his scouts we have to get this guy , john hagemann , the scout , excitedly and emphatically told bobby cox , discussing a trade the braves were considering making with the detroit tigers he was stuttering , cox related yesterday , recalling his longdistance conversation with hagemann in 1987 then he had my heart going john smoltz was the player who excited cox and hagemann the tigers wanted doyle alexander , one of the braves' veteran pitchers , for the final seven weeks of the american league east race , and they offered one of several minor league prospects in return smoltz was the guy we had to have , cox said at that time , he was nothing except a young kid with a great arm you can imagine how he would grade out in doublea ball , with a lousy record and walking everybody but you look at his fastball , his curveball , athletic ability and his age , you do n't give a darn you say , 'i have to have that guy' smoltz is one of 11 current members of the braves' roster who joined the atlanta organization when cox was the general manager four other players reached the major leagues during cox s fiveyear tenure cox , the braves' current manager , benefits from the work cox , the general manager , and his staff did from october 1985 to october 1990 not that anyone could tell during that period the braves finished last in the sixteam national league west in 1986 , crept up to fifth in 1987 , then tumbled back and finished last the next three seasons appearances did not win any votes for cox as executive of the year i know what you mean , but that s not right , cox said at shea stadium before the braves lost to the mets , 83 , last night i know what kind of job we did i was thrilled to be there every year , especially the fourth and fifth , when we saw it coming during cox s tenure , the braves drafted steve avery , mark wohlers , ryan klesko and chipper jones , traded for smoltz and signed javier lopez tom glavine , david justice , jeff blauser and mark lemke reached the majors none of those moves , though , prevented the braves from stumbling to a 6597 record and another lastplace finish in 1990 but some of those wallowing in that miserable season did not despair we still were n't very good , said glavine , who had also contributed to the previous two lastplace finishes , but you looked around the clubhouse and you saw smoltz , ave , justice , blauser , ronnie gant you 're starting to see the nucleus of some pretty good players the problem with those young players , the pitcher recalled , was consistency , or lack of it we could win some games , but we could lose some games real stupid , he said as a young team , you 're going to do that blauser said that before 1990 , or until late in that season , i do n't know if we knew what it took to win and be a winner on a consistent basis how we finished up in '90 was an indication that we started to believe in ourselves and believe we could be competitive in june of that season , cox became the manager as well as general manager , then relinquished the frontoffice duties in october to john schuerholz , who that winter signed two veteran free agents , first baseman sid bream and third baseman terry pendleton in 1990 , cox said , you could tell we could win but we needed two things badly our pitching was there , but we did n't have anyone to catch the ball , especially at first base and third base , and we did n't hit beginning in 1991 , the braves could pitch the ball , hit the ball and catch the ball they have n't stopped in other words , the mets and their followers should not despair the only thing wrong with the mets is the preseason view that burdened them with unreasonable expectations the 1996 mets maybe are the equivalent of the 1988 or '89 braves jason isringhausen , paul wilson and bill pulsipher cannot be expected to blossom into big winners any faster than glavine , avery and smoltz did pronouncing these mets comparable to the pre1991 braves , glavine said the big difference is these guys probably have a little more pressure to win than we did with us , it was more important that we show improvement as pitchers than winning games i do n't think that s the case with these guys i think there s more expectation for these guys to win blauser said the mets impressed him in spring training i was kind of surprised to see them get off to the slow start that they 've had , the shortstop said but that does n't mean they 're not a good team they have some good players everybody knows they have some darn good pitching it s just going to be a matter of time before these guys start putting it together if the mets stick with their nucleus , blauser added i think they 're going to be successful that s where we were very fortunate the braves stuck with us

los angeles chuck russell was nervous the 42yearold director of eraser , a megaexpensive arnold schwarzenegger action film opening on june 21 , had heard all the stories about the movie s turbulent shooting schedule , the extra weeks of filming , the script revisions even as cameras rolled there s nothing economical or particularly cheap about doing this kind of film , he said , taking a deep breath the studio knew what was going on another deep breath every movie is a tough movie , he said , smiling at the understatement a mile or so away from mr russell s spare office at warner brothers , jan de bont was completing work on a sound stage at universal studios in advance of his big film about tornado chasers , twister he labored seven days a week , well into the night , with an exhausted staff , to finish the movie , whose opening began the summer movie season on friday we had seven producers and almost three studios involved in this picture , said the 52yearold mr de bont a very expensive movie with almost three studios involved , was there much handson interference \? he laughed the movie was shot in oklahoma and iowa no hotels , no restaurants , he said so nobody from hollywood showed up had it been paris , well , it would have been a nightmare and across town at 20th century fox , roland emmerich , the 40yearold director and cocreator of independence day , an epic about an alien invasion , slumped in a chair , unshaven , in tattered jeans and loose sweatshirt he did not expect to complete the film until several days before it opens on july 3 a visitor wished him good luck i need it , he said , rolling his eyes i really need it welcome to the summer of '96 has there been such a season , in which studios handed the keys to the bank to so many relatively untested film makers whose modest efforts proved successful two years ago \? mr russell s comedy the mask , starring jim carrey , took in more than 100 million in the united states alone mr de bont , formerly a director of photography on black rain , and lethal weapon 3 , established himself as a top action director with his first film , speed and mr emmerich s films , the 1992 adventure universal soldier , starring jeanclaude van damme , and , two years ago , stargate , set the stage for independence day these directors' new films cost at least 100 million each , including marketing costs of 20 to 30 million there are other potential summer movie blockbusters coming , including most prominently mission impossible , starring tom cruise and directed by brian de palma there s the rock , directed by michael bay , a former video director , whose first successful film , bad boys , led to this prison drama starring sean connery and nicolas cage also on tap is the cable guy , starring jim carrey and directed by ben stiller , whose first film was reality bites , and the 10thcentury adventure dragonheart , directed by rob cohen , whose previous films include dragon the bruce lee story but except for mission impossible , which is , after all , the work of a veteran film maker , none of the other summer movies are as spectacular and expensive as twister , eraser and independence day summer is the season of fear and panic in hollywood , even more than other times of the year half the annual box office is taken in over this year s 17week summer season , and studios roll out their big guns in this period this summer seems especially nerveracking because of the olympics in atlanta the heavy television coverage of the games will probably reduce moviegoing for two weeks or so all this put special pressures on the directors of eraser , twister and independence day for 'eraser , ' problems at the starting gate with eraser , which is about a government agent who eliminates the backgrounds of people in the witness protection program , there were problems almost at the outset , partly because of mr russell s inexperience , partly because of the complicated visual and special effects the film went over budget , and there were reports of turmoil on the set at least four writers contributed to the script , and the romantic ending was filmed and refilmed until the bitter end we were constantly making changes in the script , but that s nothing new , said arnold kopelson , the producer who has made such movies as seven , the fugitive and outbreak , often working with his wife , anne on 'the fugitive , ' i had nine writers , and one stayed until the last day of filming on 'outbreak' we had four it s the process privately , people connected to the film said mr russell s indecisiveness , as well as routine overscheduling , contributed to some of the turmoil but a recent research screening of the film reportedly brought positive responses although mr russell seems especially under siege at the moment , he remains selfpossessed and surprisingly confident he rose through the ranks of hollywood under the tutelage of such film makers as roger corman mr russell directed a nightmare on elm street 3 dream warriors in 1987 , the best of that series
over the objections of civil rights advocates , the first singlesex public school in new york city in a decade will open its doors to 50 seventhgrade girls when the school year begins in september , a board of education official said yesterday when plans for the school , known as the young women s leadership school , were disclosed last month , questions were immediately raised about whether it would violate federal and city discrimination laws by excluding boys while still bracing for a possible lawsuit , school planners , including officials in the east harlem school district where it is located , have taken several steps in recent weeks to assure the school s legality those steps , which include allowing boys to apply if they choose , have largely satisfied schools chancellor rudy crew , who does not intend to block its opening , said dr judith rizzo , the deputy chancellor for instruction i want to see this system be flexible enough to accommodate a whole variety of options , said dr rizzo , herself a graduate of an allgirls catholic school it behooves us to explore this the school , conceived by andrew tisch , the chairman of the loews corporation , and his wife , ann rubenstein tisch , is inspired by a simple premise studies have shown that girls , particularly in poor neighborhoods like east harlem , perform better when boys are not in the classroom but critics of the school , including the new york civil liberties union and the new york civil rights coalition , say that the changes planners have made in an attempt to make the school pass legal scrutiny are largely cosmetic they say they still hope to prevent the school from opening , through the courts or by appeal to federal and state education officials if they are not going to do any affirmative outreach to boys , said norman siegel , the executive director of the new york civil liberties union , then that is not acceptable while officials in community school district 4 say they have decided to permit boys to apply to the school and be interviewed for admission , they concede that they have not actively recruited boys and that none have come forward the incoming fall class , they add , is now virtually full and even if a boy did apply , school officials said , they are not sure whether they would accept him , considering that the interview process is geared toward finding girls interested in learning to be leaders then there is the question of whether the school , which will occupy the top three floors of a commercial building on east 106th street near park avenue , is technically a freestanding school to the board of education , it will be designated a program that is part of nearby junior high school 13 , which is coed under the 27yearold law desegregating the city s schools , community school districts may start new programs without the consent of the board of education or the chancellor , dr rizzo said under that provision , districts have opened dozens of alternative academies in recent years by calling them programs the legal distinction is important , because it allows the school to open without any action by the chancellor , dr rizzo said but a district official , who insisted on anonymity , said that the designation was largely one of semantics girls who attend the young women s leadership school , the official said , will have no reason to enter the junior high school building that they theoretically attend to michael meyers , the executive director of the civil rights coalition , calling the girls school a program is a form of subterfuge that allows the chancellor not to intervene and not to enforce the law while the school is expected to open on sept 4 , its future remains very much unresolved the district board passed a resolution on may 15 calling for the school to expand to grades 9 through 12 in the coming years , making it a junior high school and high school but only the board of education has the authority to open a high school , and dr rizzo said that the chancellor s office would carefully study the legal ramifications and the school s performance this year before allowing it to expand the board of education is to have a preliminary discussion of the matter with lawyers from the city and planners of the school in an executive session on aug 21 meanwhile , plans for the school are moving ahead the leased space , which once housed an arts high school , is ready for the students to move in a director and three teachers have been hired and last week , as mrs tisch looked on , many of the girls assembled at the school to be measured for their uniforms navy blazers , pleated skirts and white blouses which are optional , but designed to give the school the air of the private academies it aspires to emulate i do n't feel any apprehension that anything would threaten the opening of school , said leonides cortez , a clerical supervisor at a medical clinic , who gladly paid the 120 cost of her daughter leslie ann s uniform my daughter is getting bored with summer right now and wishes the school would open sooner
moscow , thursday , july 4 rejecting a return to the communist past that has defined 20thcentury russia , voters reelected the country s first president , boris n yeltsin , on wednesday by an unexpectedly wide margin mr yeltsin , who played a crucial role in the dissolution of the soviet union and the creation of the new russian state , arose from what seemed like political oblivion to defeat his challenger , the communist leader , gennadi a zyuganov with 92 percent of the votes counted by early today , mr yeltsin held a commanding lead of 5355 percent to 4055 percent , according to official figures about 5 percent of the voters exercised a third choice to not vote for either candidate just two weeks ago , in a first round that provided neither man with enough support to claim the presidency , mr yeltsin edged mr zyuganov by 3 percent of the votes all of you , absolutely all of you must come vote , the president said wednesday morning as he cast his ballot at a polling station near his country home please do not forget your duty today apparently too ill to vote as usual in moscow , where hundreds of journalists waited for him , mr yeltsin spoke for less than a minute before being hustled by bodyguards from public view few elections , certainly none in russia , have provided a sharper choice to a more openly divided nation mr yeltsin , however flawed and inconsistent , embodied the painful economic reforms he introduced when he came to power in 1991 mr zyuganov , the 52yearold former communist apparatchik who took a humiliated and detested party and made it the strongest political organization in the nation , promised the return of a great russia to millions who had been defeated and impoverished by the new one nobody will lose today and nobody will win , said mr zyuganov , who on wednesday as for the past 10 days has sounded more like the powerful opposition leader he intends to become than a man planning to occupy the presidency in the current conditions , russia itself will lose if our course continues but it cannot continue , even if everyone wanted it to mr yeltsin , 65 , whose intense spree of campaigning stopped completely in the past two weeks , won with the powerful help of an early opponent , the outspoken nationalist aleksandr i lebed , who was appointed immediately after the first round of voting to the newly created and immensely influential post of mr yeltsin s national security czar exit polls conducted for the new york times showed that the vast majority of the 15 million russians who supported the retired general in the first round voted for mr yeltsin this time that support , combined with mr zyuganov s inability to reach very far beyond his core of alienated pensioners , rural residents and factory workers idled by the end of a command economy , insured the president s victory voters made their choice mostly by rejecting communism few expressed enthusiasm for the president , who has interspersed his advocacy of democracy with the actions of an autocrat throughout the year russians voters have said they are particularly upset about the war in secessionist chechnya , and few have faith in mr yeltsin s repeated claims that the fighting is done but mr lebed , a retired general long critical of the conflict , has insisted that the war will end , and most russians say they believe him mr yeltsin ran almost wholly as an alternative to a painful communist past , reminding russians that communism meant rationing , hunger and fear he dominated television , using government dollars to promise higher salaries and pensions at every one of the dozens of stops he made when he feared that a runoff on a sunday as called for in the constitution would jeopardize his reelection because so many supporters would be at their country homes , he simply changed the vote to a weekday but his plans worked he managed early on to convince voters and the news media that there were only two viable candidates for the presidency , and that he was one of them after that the news media , fearing that a communist victory would end their new freedoms , supported mr yeltsin without question or debate now will come the hard part mr yeltsin has to form a government , and he needs to account for the fact that tens of millions of russians cast their ballots for a candidate whose platform was essentially the opposite of his own he will also need to show the same vigor in the coming months that he did in the past six months but with his health in question , that may be hard of course he is now going to slow down , said galina starovoitova , a liberal member of parliament who herself attempted to run for the presidency we know the character of our president very well in moments of danger , he is reborn like a phoenix , but in victory he tends to rest on his laurels the biggest question facing mr yeltsin is whether he will be able to serve his full term he has been absent from public view for nearly 5 of the past 13 months , and his two serious episodes of heart disease in the past year do not inspire confidence despite his remarkable showing on the campaign trail before the first round of elections or perhaps because of it mr yeltsin seems in need of serious recuperation

a patron at an illegal east harlem social club fired an automatic weapon into the crowded dance floor friday night , killing a teenager and injuring seven other people , the police said the police said they were not certain what prompted the gunfire at the nightclub , the red door , on third avenue between 121st and 122d streets , but one patron said the dispute may have begun because someone inside the packed hall bumped up against a female companion of the gunman it was very crowded and people were pushing , said valerie blaimeyer , 16 , who left moments before the shooting began david gonzalez , 16 , was shot once in the chest and died at the scene seven other victims , ages 12 through 31 , also were injured , but inspector john d'adamo said none of the injuries seemed to be lifethreatening neighborhood residents said the hall was a legitimate salsa club until two years ago , when the owner closed it and moved to puerto rico since then , it has repeatedly been broken into by people who hold unlicensed hiphop parties where drug use , underage drinking and gunplay are common ivelisse velasquez , who frequently attends the parties , said friday s dance was sponsored by a group called freaky deaky , which charged a 5 admission and set up a sound system and a small bar it was a sweatbox , it was so packed , said ms velasquez , 16 , who said she was one of about 100 patrons friday night people getting drunk , kids getting hyper and not knowing how to handle themselves everybody fighting over girls and boys people used to bring guns there , then bring their beef outside and shoot the place up inspector d'adamo said the police and the city s social club task force have repeatedly raided the club , most recently in june and august arrests were made each time , and we closed the place , and then it eventually somehow gets opened , he said we 're going to continue trying to close this place he said investigators had not yet determined who owned the property neighborhood residents who gathered outside the brick , threestory building yesterday said that many who patronized the club were drug dealers who brought handguns friends of david gonzalez , the teenager who died , said he was a good student who went to the club only to dance and socialize he was n't the type of kid who would be in trouble , said dolores rodriguez , 19 he was innocent to all this

it was a few days after the violent robbery that had killed abdul kareem alsahybi in his brooklyn delicatessen the store was closed , bags filled with bulletriddled cigarette packs and other evidence clogged the aisle , and mr alsahybi s blood still stained the floor but the lottery machine , destroyed in the shootout on friday night , had already been replaced and was ready for the store to reopen the shiny new computer terminal blinked its incongruously optimistic message play here ! the lottery jackpot is 10 million ! as the murdered man s brother mopped the floor with ammonia and his oldest son greeted grieving friends mr alsahybi s oldest son , ali , a slight man of 23 , seemed to be trying to understand his loss he was also wrestling with the troubling notion that the gambling machine that had helped bring the family its livelihood may also have brought it tragedy mr alsahybi , who was 48 and emigrated from yemen 24 years ago , had opened his store four years ago at 493 henry street , a residential block on the border of carroll gardens and cobble hill just around the corner , there are statues of the virgin mary on many a lawn , and red ribbons left over from christmas decorate the trees violent crime is not associated with this quiet corner of brooklyn but the two men who entered just before 11 pm each had a gun so did mr alsahybi , who may have wounded one assailant now , he is dead , leaving behind his wife and seven children who joined him here five years ago there is no way to know if the shootout was related to the lure of lottery proceeds small stores that are open late are favorite targets of crime no matter what they sell , and the suspects , whom the police describe as two men in their 20 s , remain at large but officers in the station house of the nearby 76th precinct strongly suspect a link to the lottery it s the only thing that distinguished it , said a detective who requested anonymity neighboring store owners agree , noting that the lottery traffic on fridays is heavy because fridays are pick five days maybe it was the gambling , said ali alsahybi , an economics major at brooklyn college but standing in the closed store four days after his father s death , he could not imagine the idea of dropping the lottery he is a young man who finds himself suddenly forced to face some grim realities one reality is that he has to drop out of school to run the store so he can support his family his other reality is that he could not give up selling those statesponsored tickets and games at the cobble hill deli and grocery , even if he wanted to he could n't afford it without lotto , maybe nobody will buy our stuff , he said the lotto , it makes people buy food , ice cream it does more than that the gaming passion of new yorkers who play out their dreams of instant wealth at lottery counters keeps stores like mr alsahybi s going most earn more from gambling than they do from selling newspapers or m m s lottery vendors there are 4 , 557 of them in the city make 6 percent on sales , which range from 1 , 000 a day to twice that , say owners of small stores , depending on the size of the lottery jackpot that can make lottery vendors vulnerable the police department says that stores that sell lottery tickets do not suffer from higher crime and that , in fact , those in busy areas are unusually safe because they attract so much traffic but that theory has its skeptics last november , for instance , a retired city correction officer was killed during a robbery attempt in an east flatbush bar patrons blamed the advent of quick draw keno so some storekeepers are not taking any chances in poor economic areas , they have bulletproof plexiglas , said the detective in the station house but none of the stores on this side of the highway do , he added , referring to the brooklynqueens expressway that would n't go around here all around here , it s gentrified yuppies it is also an area that feels safe you think nothing will happen it s all families , said fisal shamakh , who runs the cobble hill variety and grocery on court street , a few blocks from mr alsahybi s delicatessen he sells lottery tickets , too mr shamakh , who saidhe has not been robbed , tries to get to the bank often so he does not have much cash around he does not stay open late , either but he is on a busy street the alsahybis' store is not ali alsahybi is in too much turmoil to decide now how he is going to run the deli , whether he will keep shorter hours or install more security he will , he said , do what he has to do to support his family they are all in school , except for the youngest he is only 4 if i do n't take care of them , he asked , who will \?
the new york city mayoral campaign has heated up before the public had time to get over the bad taste of the national elections , with their overload of specialinterest money and the collapse of any real limits on campaign spending the events of this week should put the public on alert the city appears to be heading for a noholdsbarred political fight , and the spirit of local campaignfinance laws has already been violated first , manhattan borough president ruth messinger used more than 7 , 000 of her public budget to air radio ads attacking mayor rudolph giuliani s plan to open up areas zoned for manufacturing to superstore development ms messinger has a natural concern about the issue , given her long history of involvement in landuse matters but the ad she chose to air , which harshly described the mayor as indifferent to neighborhood concerns , sounded very much like a campaign commercial since a republican city council member has already filed a complaint about the messinger ads , the conflicts of interest board will presumably decide whether the borough president has violated any law but there is no question that her actions were unseemly few citizens of this city have been greater champions of campaignfinance reform than ruth messinger , and none should have greater sensitivity to the appearance of misusing taxpayer money to promote her mayoral ambitions the mayor , for his part , is planning to run his own ads , with a budget now estimated at 100 , 000 the money will be raised by a private group known as the committee for consumer choice but the effort was organized by mayoral aides , including deputy mayor fran reiter , who read an early version of the radio spot on the air this week the ads suggest that politicians who oppose the mayor s plan are indifferent to the needs of poor and minority communities for better food stores , and urge listeners who want larger supermarkets and discount stores to call a number that is the mayor s action center the mayor s ads avoid attacking any other politician by name but his initial failure to name any of the private citizens behind the fundraising was wrong yesterday ms reiter did come up with names of people who had agreed to serve as public leaders she said donors would be disclosed later , after the group registers as a lobbying organization ms reiter has already said that most of the money would probably come from retailers and developers it is hard to understand why the mayor , who has immediate access to the media almost any time he wants it , chose to tie himself to an ad campaign that may be underwritten by donors with a financial interest along with their advertising battle , mr giuliani and ms messinger have also raised the level of rhetoric the mayor unfairly charged that ms messinger had cheated in raising money for previous races ms messinger suggested in turn that the mayor needed valium a crude exchange so early in the political season is a bad sign in itself but the money issue is more troubling than the bad manners the public has had more than enough experience with politicians who skirt the edge of propriety in order to maximize their advertising budgets the mayor and ms messinger have , in very different ways , made their names as champions of clean government we would like to see them setting a much better example at this stage of the game the people interested in megastore development should be able to organize a lobbying campaign without the help of mr giuliani s staff if ms messinger wanted to run radio ads attacking mr giuliani , she should have paid for them out of her sizable campaign war chest
president clinton will have to work with the republican congress to keep his promise to fix the welfare law that he signed over the protests of many democrats but his administration has sole control of the implementation of a potentially punitive provision of the new law that provision would knock children off disability rolls how well mr clinton protects those children will provide the first postelection test of his resolve to block congress s worst impulses about one million poor children receive federal money under the supplemental security income program most recipients suffer from welldefined physical or mental handicaps that are so severe that no one disputes their eligibility but about 300 , 000 of these children qualify for ssi because of a combination of functional impairments , no one of which may be severe it is this group that some members of congress want to drive off the rolls , even though no federal study has shown a pattern of abuse they have accused parents of abusing the program , coaching their children to feign maladaptive behavior and other handicaps the new law eliminates maladaptive behavior as a qualifying handicap it also vaguely calls for an overall tightening of standards but , in a flash of good judgment , congress left the task of issuing new guidelines due in the next few weeks to the administration that means mr clinton has the authority to protect these children the question before the administration is how many of these 300 , 000 children with the combination of functional impairments are truly disabled within this group , the children the administration is most likely to rule ineligible are an estimated 50 , 000 who are less dramatically impaired they qualify for ssi under current rules because they suffer a combination of three moderate functional impairments the administration will be tempted to throw all these children out of ssi just to appease congress s intent to tighten eligibility the temptation should be resisted jonathan stein , the general counsel of community legal services , an advocacy group in philadelphia , points out that these supposedly moderate handicaps can be severely debilitating as one of many examples , he cites a 6yearold child with a very low iq of 72 and a mild case of cerebral palsy who cannot walk or talk well by ssi standards , none of these mental or physical handicaps are severe but the combination surely is a blanket rejection of aid for children with three nonsevere handicaps would cruelly leave the poor parents of these severely handicapped children to fend for themselves the administration needs to make finer distinctions rather than simply sweep out broad categories the rules that the administration will soon issue will determine how many vulnerable children are stripped of federal benefits mr clinton s obligation , no matter how much anger he provokes on capitol hill , is to make sure that every child he separates from ssi is undeserving appeasing capitol hill s need to find abuse where it may not exist or , worse , saving money on the backs of the disabled might be politically expedient , but it is unfair
seattle , june 11 some of the seattle supersonics already have one foot in hawaii it seems like a lot of people around here are starting to give up , seattle forward shawn kemp said monday , his team trailing the chicago bulls by three games to none in the national basketball association finals the sonics appear to be playing for sneaker contracts now , and it has their allstar forward livid you never give up because you never know , kemp said anything can happen anybody can get hurt not just the players the coaches , everybody you ca n't just turn your back and walk away from this series when you still have a game to me , that s ridiculous who knows if we 'll ever be back in the finals \? the only way you can correct the problem is going out and giving it your all if you just go out and just give up and not challenge the problem , then you 're weak i kind of feel like we gave up a little bit the other day in game 3 if you 're going to come out here and just hand it to them , you 're weak , man you 're a coward this might go for the players' wives and girlfriends , too an attractive woman approached michael jordan before game 3 on sunday , begging for an autograph she was monique james gary payton s fiancee the good life michael jordan and the bulls rarely slum it they are the only national basketball association team this season to stay at the posh four seasons hotel in seattle , and jordan s suite goes for 950 a night jordan wore golfing attire to today s news conference , did 30 minutes of interviews and hit the links soft in the middle \? the sonics are about to make a lineup change coach george karl said he is leaning toward starting the sixth man sam perkins at center ahead of the soft , foulprone ervin johnson in game 4 on wednesday i guess i 'll try to pick up the offense a little bit , perkins said johnson has been obliterated by the bulls' starting center , luc longley , an australian not known for his mean streak he fought washington s chris webber this preseason , but other than that , teammates have been begging him to flash his upper teeth he s just a gentle giant , really , forward dennis rodman said of longley he wants to talk trash , but he ca n't he wants to burst out and be a mean and vicious center in this league , but he ca n't it s not his nature he does n't think so george karl said if he were handing out the most valuable player trophy for the finals , he would give it to michael jordan or dennis rodman rodman heard that and nearly choked i do n't think anybody 'd vote me mvp , no matter what i do in game 4 , rodman said i do n't think the nba would allow that
albany , july 22 three top advisers to gov george e pataki said today that they had each received payments of at least 20 , 000 from a fund created from private donations to finance mr pataki s inauguration and transition the advisers are zenia mucha , mr pataki s director of communications michael c finnegan , the governor s counsel , and john o'mara , the chairman of the state public service commission they said the money was for the work they did helping mr pataki set up a new administration immediately after he defeated mario m cuomo in november 1994 today s disclosures were among the clearest accountings yet of how the secret inaugural fund , which has been the subject of an assembly investigation and a court battle , spent its money democrats have estimated that the fund raised 14 million , but mr pataki s aides say the figure is closer to 1 million ms mucha said she received between 20 , 000 and 30 , 000 mr o'mara said he received 25 , 000 and mr finnegan said he got about 45 , 000 financial disclosure forms filed with the state ethics commission also showed that at least six other members of the pataki administration had been paid salaries or reimbursed for personal expenses by the transition and inaugural fund , though it was unclear how much they had received democrats and government watchdog groups questioned the payments today , saying that the state s top policy makers should not have taken money from a fund financed largely by corporations and individuals who are regulated by state agencies or have state contracts you do n't want people holding important government positions to be paid by people who are then going to depend on the favors and decisionmaking of these recipients , said senator franz s leichter , a manhattan democrat it represents a real conflict but ms mucha said that none of the people who received money from the fund knew who had contributed to it , and therefore could not have been influenced people were doing a job , she said they were working 24 hours a day , seven days a week , trying to put a transition together , trying to organize an inauguration , putting together a government no one was interested in who was contributing , no one had access to the names of contributors and for people to make something out of nothing is preposterous soon after the fund was created in late 1994 , the pataki administration promised to release detailed information about the names of contributors , the size of their donations and how the money was used but despite those pledges , the governor s allies who controlled the fund refused to release the financial records last november , saying they did not want the governor to know who had contributed to it , for ethical reasons even though mr pataki had met many of the contributors at a 1 , 000aplate fundraiser in manhattan and many of the donors' names were printed on programs distributed at the inauguration after that refusal , the democratic leadership of the assembly launched an investigation , issuing subpoenas for the financial records from the two private corporations that controlled the fund mr pataki s supporters challenged those subpoenas in court , but lost in a decision released last week lawyers for the fund said today that they expected to release some of the financial records this week ms mucha said she was paid between 20 , 000 and 30 , 000 she said she could not recall the exact amount for working fulltime for the transition between the election on nov 7 , 1994 , and jan 1 , 1995 , when mr pataki took office she said the payments also compensated her for having lost five weeks in vacation time she had accumulated while working for senator alfonse m d'amato before joining mr pataki s campaign i was compensated for my work and for what they felt i would be losing by not going back to the senate , she said mr finnegan said his 45 , 000 payment was for his work directing mr pataki s transition team , a job he said consumed all his time for seven weeks mr finnegan s former law partner , stephen j mignano , also was paid about 25 , 000 from the fund for professional services , said h neal conolly , a lawyer for the fund mr finnegan said he did not know what that payment was for , and mr mignano did not return phone calls though a spokesman , mr o'mara , who is the state s chief regulator of the electric and natural gas industry , said that his 25 , 000 payment compensated him for quitting his law job and working full time on mr pataki s transition between november 1994 and midfebruary 1995 robert e boyle , who was the fund s treasurer before being appointed by mr pataki as president of the jacob k javits convention center , received at least 10 , 000 from the fund in 1995 , mr conolly said several other top pataki advisers have reported receiving payments of at least 1 , 000 from the fund in their annual ethics reports to the state those officials included health commissioner barbara a debuono bradford j race , jr , mr pataki s chief of staff , and three top officials at the state department of economic development , caroline quartararo , robert ryan and carolyn bachan the ethics reports did not require the officials to list exactly how much money they were paid

wanaque , nj here in northern passaic county , development is starting to push at the edges of onceremote forests sixty miles to the southwest , a sleepy country highway has become a major truck route and over in westchester county , booming traffic has led to plans to widen the eastwest interstate each is a chapter of the same story , ripple effects from the opening two and a half years ago of a new , 20mile stretch of interstate 287 , from montville , nj , to suffern , just across the new york border the new road has changed traffic patterns across the region it has openedan environmentally sensitive watershed area to a potential construction boom and it serves as a primer on the consequences , intended or not , of highway construction in the 1940 s and 1950 s , as robert moses was building highway after highway through new york city , long island and areas upstate , planners learned that it is all but impossible to build one s way out of highway congestion more roads encourage more driving they make remote areas accessible , which leads to development , which brings in more drivers this is now conventional wisdom to many transportation analysts , and they point to interstate 287 as proof it s as if we had n't learned anything in the last 50 years , said david bernstein , a professor of civil engineering at princeton university who has studied the phenomenon the rule is this if you build it , they will come it s called induced demand every mile of road you build induces people to drive to some degree , state highway officials agree we 're not trying to build out of congestion anymore , said sharon l landers , deputy transportation commissioner we do n't even have that option anymore there s no room still , she argued that the final piece of interstate 287 was needed because it was a missing link in the region s web of highways the simple fact that the highway is used by more than 50 , 000 vehicles daily shows , she said , that it is needed mission accomplished longhaul drivers can bypass city the highway has , in part , done what it was supposed to enable longdistance motorists , particularly truckers , to swing wide of new york city drivers headed from boston to baltimore who used to take the crossbronx expressway , the george washington bridge and the new jersey turnpike can now take a lessdirect but lesscongested route , the crosswestchester expressway , tappan zee bridge and interstate 287 , picking up the turnpike south of the worst traffic areas the slightly longer trip may actually be faster for truckers and can lower shipping costs in the two years after the highway opened , truck traffic on the tappan zee rose 70 percent but there has been no reduction in the traffic on the old route it is as if legions of cars and trucks just materialized at the same time , enterprising truckers have found that with the interstate 287 link , they can avoid the turnpike and its high tolls altogether by taking secondary highways through mercer and somerset counties as a result , truck traffic on those roads has soared none of this comes as any surprise this is what highways do , said jeff zupan , a transportation consultant to the regional plan association , a nonprofit group that advises governments on development the new , sixlane stretch of interstate 287 completed a beltway around the metropolitan region , like half a giant circle with new york city at its center the last segment , a 20mile stretch through morris , passaic and bergen counties , was fought by residents , environmental groups and some elected officials for 20 years but they lost the battle in the 1980 s , and the new road opened in november 1993 an interchange in suffern , linking interstate 287 to the new york state thruway , opened the next year it was needed because it makes the movement of goods around the region easier , mr zupan said if it s difficult and expensive to move things from one place to another , if every truck headed to new england has to go through the bronx , then the region is not going to stay competitive at the same time , many local officials say that interstate 287 will spur a population explosion in the region it passes through to date , however , the boom has been slow to materialize , muted by a sluggish economy and also by the region s hilly topography highways bring suburban sprawl out here , bring industry out here , and suddenly this area is a job center , said g thomas donch , mayor of franklin lakes how do people get here to work \? there s no mass transit , so they drive so more highways , more traffic building welcomed montville s mayor cites tax revenue some municipal officials , like montville mayor robert c auriemma , welcome the new construction , or ratables , because of the property taxes it brings in the highway brought us ratables we really needed , he said montville saw 75 million in construction in 1994 and 1995 , nearly all of it residential , he said new housing and retail and office buildings have already sprouted along interstate 287 , and opponents of development predict that each off ramp will become a can opener , punching a hole for development and traffic to pour through in wanaque , passaic county is about to build a much wider route 511 to carry the expected increase in traffic
from the new england journal of medicine comes the story of a north carolina family that was devastated by the inflexible and thoroughly inhumane decisions of a national health maintenance organization a threemonthold girl was referred by the hmo to a pediatriconcology group at the university of north carolina hospitals in chapel hill the hmo was not identified in the article , which appeared in the feb 22 issue of the journal i am withholding its name at the request of the authors , dr brent weston , a staff physician , and marie lauria , a clinical social worker hmo s have been known to retaliate against critics a respected cambridge physician , dr david himmelstein , recently was fired without cause by us healthcare after he criticized certain managedcare practices on television and in print he was reinstated after a public outcry \) the threemonthold girl was diagnosed with leukemia a bone marrow transplant , with her older sister as the donor , was recommended the hmo approved the transplant and asked for help in arranging a transfer of the baby to a hospital in another state that had been designated by the hmo to do all bone marrow transplants in the region dr weston and ms lauria wrote that it soon became clear that treatment out of state for several months would be detrimental to the family both parents were distraught the father would not be able to be involved because of employment restrictions the mother , who obviously needed to be with the infant , would lose her position and be forced to take a lesser job with a pay cut the older sister , who was having serious behavioral problems , would have to be separated from her mother for a prolonged period the expenses associated with an extended stay in a city where the family had no relatives or friends would be difficult for the family to manage there are two excellent transplantation centers nearby in our own state and we were asked to request that the hmo make an exception to its policy on selecting a transplantation center they asked , but such humanitarian concerns are not what corporate care is about in the competition with profits , patients must always lose the hmo said no there would be no exception the transplant would have to be done out of state dr weston and ms lauria were cautioned by their colleagues not to push the hmo too far a transplant specialist warned them against offending the carrier because we are in the running for the next contract others suggested , sympathetically , that they wise up to the new medicaleconomic reality the hmo complained about their interference with the clientcarrier relationship the entire experience was disorienting the expanding universe of corporate care is a very strange environment for health professionals concerned primarily with the needs of their patients the baby was taken out of state for the transplant and was not returned to the care of her physicians in north carolina for six months the older sister was sent to live with relatives in a different state the mother was demoted compounding all other problems , the father lost his job several weeks ago the baby suffered a relapse when a second transplant was contemplated , the hmo , for reasons having nothing to do with the quality of care , recommended a different transplant center in yet another state dr weston and ms lauria were appalled none of the factors that had made the first transplant such an enormous problem had changed in addition , they wrote , the first transplantation center had established an ongoing relationship with the family now the family would have to start all over , at a different center in a different state this time , in order to keep the family together , the mother quit her job , gave up her hmo coverage , and applied for medicaid the parents have lost their home and their savings , wrote dr weston and ms lauria , and the older sister has had increasingly severe behavioral problems that , of course , is the family s problem corporate care is about the bottom line there will be no exceptions
mississippi an american journey by anthony walton illustrated 279 pages alfred a knopf 24 there is , says anthony walton early on in this literary journey toward awareness , something almost unspeakably primal and vicious about mississippi it is the the poorest of the 50 states and the highest among them in the number of lynchings that were carried out on its soil , 581 since 1882 , all but 42 of the victims black something endures in mississippi , mr walton continues , something savage unleashed there that has yet to come to rest thirty years since the voting rights act , mississippi has the largest number of black elected officials of any state , which might lead some mississippians to believe that the savage in their state is mostly behind them and yet mr walton is no doubt correct in saying that in the historical sense , certainly , and in the way that history seeps into the present , mississippi strikes the most somber chords of american memory and experience faulkner understood that , and richard wright , the author of black boy and native son and one of mr walton s heroes , did as well so , too , did a decent majority of the american nation when the country was transfixed by the nationally televised testimony of fanny lou hamer , one of mississippi s early civil rights campaigners the murder of 14yearold emmet till , and of the martyrs james chaney , andrew goodman and michael schwerner but if mississippi has been powerfully inscribed in literature and memory before , nobody has written about it quite the way mr walton does in mississippi an american journey this is in large part because of mr walton s skills as a writer and storyteller , which are considerable but indispensable also is the particular historical moment that he represents mr walton looks at mississippi in the way american jews or italians or irish might look back at the old country in europe , as a place of primal roots that one is glad to be away from and yet toward which one is strangely drawn in the quest for selfunderstanding mr walton describes himself as a man of privilege who grew up in middleclass comfort in suburban chicago , feeling perfectly free to date white girls , and who found that his most pressing choice was often whether to have espresso or cappuccino after dinner he went to notre dame and brown universities and , even though he has paid the black tax , as he puts it , suffering the petty , daily indignities that take such a toll on the psyches of american blacks , he makes no claim that racial discrimination has fatally blocked his life s path but mr walton s parents paid a far heavier black tax than he , having grown up poor in mississippi and moved north in the 1950 s to seek better prospects as a child , mr walton went to mississippi on family visits his book is based on frequent visits he made there as an adult , seeking to understand where he came from and how that place fashioned both his identity and the american one and so mr walton talks and travels , observes and thinks aloud , with results that are at times wonderfully illuminating and always interesting , even when some of his declarations , especially those of a political nature , seem oddly disconnected from the personal experience he describes mr walton interviews his mother , dorothy , as the two travel by car from illinois to mississippi even more memorably , he talks with his father , claude , who answers his son s question about what he first remembered about mississippi with a single word bigotry \( he said this quietly , mr walton writes , as if there were nothing else to report and this single word explained it all \) it is through his father , who he says had created my privilege when he himself had none , that mr walton most effectively plumbs the depths of mississippi s special racial savagery here , the story is in the details that go beyond the abstract notions of separateness and inequality claude walton remembers how the books at school always had a white student s name written on the covers since we always got the old books , the white kids got 'em first he also remembers the day a sheriff named holbrooks shot and killed his teenage friend james crump in the town square of holly springs , where the two of them were growing up for the author , mississippi is the battered cradle of much of black america , including the middleclass black america that he knew near chicago he writes the state s history , spinning back to the first spanish and french explorers , the arrival of the slaves , the indian massacres and removals he covers more familiar ground as well the civil war , reconstruction , jim crow and the movement for black rights he writes fine , short essays on faulkner and wright , as well as on medgar evers , hamer and the pioneering blues singer robert johnson , and also about less admirable figures like james k vardaman and theodore bilbo , the governors who came to symbolize racist mississippi there is a gentleness to mr walton s literary persona that is part of the appeal of this book there is no racial militancy here , but rather a deep sadness as mr walton wills himself to drink from the bitterness of the past here and there , anger does seep through , and sometimes it tinges the narrative with moralistic hyperbole i had known , of course , that america s history was tragic and sordid , but had not understood how pervasive was its darkness , he writes all of america \? the abolitionists \? the people who put hamer on national television \? mr walton s anger also seems to lead him near the end of his book to some rather thin and cursory reporting of current state issues still , it is not difficult to understand what he calls the steady darkening of my outlook , as mr walton confronts mississippi in one telling passage , he writes of attending a football game at the university of mississippi and being startled to see 50 , 000 whites waving confederate flags to urge on their black gladiators waved as an innocuous symbol of cultural identity by whites , the rebel flag to mr walton emblemizes the separate subjective worlds of blacks and whites , worlds that his fine , sensitive and poignant work should help to draw together
the hague , june 27 a united nations tribunal announced today the indictment of eight bosnian serb military and police officers in connection with rapes of muslim women in the bosnian war , marking the first time sexual assault has been treated separately as a crime of war the indictments were announced by the international criminal tribunal in the hague after almost two years of investigations court officials said that although rape charges had been included in other cases , this indictment gave organized rape and other sexual offenses their due place in international law as crimes against humanity this is a landmark indictment because it focuses exclusively on sexual assaults , without including any other charges , said christian chartier , a spokesman for the court there is no precedent for this it is of major legal significance because it illustrates the court s strategy to focus on genderrelated crimes and give them their proper place in the prosecution of war crimes experts said that while previous postwar courts have heard evidence of rape , they have treated it as secondary , tolerated as part of soldiers' abusive behavior the military tribunal in nuremberg , which judged nazi crimes after world war ii , made no reference to rape in its charter at a tokyo war crimes court after world war ii , some japanese officials were convicted of failing to prevent rape but evidence of the magnitude of rape in bosnia was so shocking that it persuaded the tribunal s chief prosecutor , richard goldstone , and others to confront the issue rape has never been the concern of the international community , justice goldstone said in an interview in an early stage of the investigations we have to deal openly with these abuses according to investigators of the european union and amnesty international , rape was often used in bosnia as a strategy to terrorize people they said that all three parties to the conflict , including muslims and croats , had committed sexual abuses , but that bosnian serbs had been the main perpetrators the european investigators calculated that in 1992 , 20 , 000 muslim women and girls were raped by serbs the eight serbs charged today , all either in the military , the paramilitary or the police , are accused of rapes committed between april 1992 and february 1993 in or near foca in southeastern bosnia none have been arrested the indictment described the ordeal of 14 muslim women in foca , none of them named , some of them as young as 12 years of age most were detained in a prison camp , where they were subjected to almost constant rape and sexual assaults , torture and other abuses the physical and psychological health of many female detainees seriously deteriorated as a result of the sexual assaults , the indictment said the detainees lived in constant fear some became suicidal others suffered from depression all suffered psychological and emotional harm some remain traumatized a woman who complained to the local chief of police , dragan gogovic , about the abuse was then herself raped by him , the indictment said a 15yearold girl , witness no 87 , was taken prisoner in july 1992 and raped by four men over the next two weeks , the indictment said , she and others were gangraped every evening by groups of soldiers she endured rapes for eight months , the indictment said part of the time she and other women were kept in a house where they had to cook , wash and clean for soldiers in the daytime and were raped at night witness no 87 , now 19 , said that much of the time she wanted to die on feb 25 , 1993 , one of the accused , radomir kovac , sold the girl for 500 german marks to two soldiers from montenegro today the tribunal also issued a second indictment in which nine men , bosnian croats , were charged with war crimes during attacks on muslim villages in the lasva valley in central bosnia in 199293 these indictments were ready last november , but the announcement was delayed because the court feared for the safety of victims and witnesses today s new charges brings the number of suspects accused of war crimes in bosnia to 75 one has died of cancer seven are being held in the hague the rest are at large the tribunal also began public hearings today against its two most wanted suspects , radovan karadzic and gen ratko mladic , the bosnian serb leaders the evidence against the two , who are not in custody , was presented to put more pressure on western powers to arrest them the prosecution contends that the two are responsible for the deaths , rapes and torture of thousands of bosnian serbs , the prosecutor , eric ostberg , said in his opening they are being charged with individual responsibility for the war crimes committed by their subordinates , the prosecutor , a jurist from sweden , told the court he said that he would seek to prove that the two men were guilty of the ultimate crime of genocide this and other crimes for which the two men were twice indicted , include atrocities against civilians in bosnia , specifically during the siege of sarajevo and sbrebrenica and the taking of united nations peacekeeping soldiers as hostage the hearings , the first to involve the most senior bosnian serbs , are largely symbolic , but dr karadzic , who has declared the tribunal irrelevant and incompetent , on this occasion sent a lawyer to represent him court officials were surprised by the arrival of the attorney , igor pantelic , just hours before the opening of the hearings mr pantelic , 39 , who has a law firm in belgrade , presented the court with a letter signed by dr karadzic in which dr karadzic said he was authorizing the attorney to represent him before the internationl tribunal in the hague and to set up a team of lawyers which will act in my interest and with my prior consent court officials and lawyers attending the hearings said it was the first time dr karadzic had acknowledged the court s authority but the lawyer was not permitted to be present in court the presence of the defense lawyer would transform the proceedings into a trial in absentia , the prosecutor said , adding that this would be against court rules iranian fighters have left bosnia washington , june 27 \( reuters \) the united states has announced that the bosnian government has complied with a bosnian peace accord requirement to sever military and intelligence ties with iran and send home iranian fighters the white house said the certification removed a major stumbling block to starting a united statesled program to train and equip armed forces of the muslimcroat federation but a white house spokesman , brian cullin , said on wednesday that a final obstacle remained the muslimcroat federation must pass a law integrating the bosnian muslim and bosnian croat military he said washington was optimistic that the law would be passed , but had no timetable the united states is ready to provide 100 million in surplus military equipment once the law is passed , he said under the bosnian peace accord , the bosnian government agreed to insure iranian fighters were withdrawn from bosnia at the war s end some 2 , 000 fighters remained
a new york city program that has led to the installation of 11 million watersaving toilets has squandered more than 7 million and has been plagued by mismanagement , leaving some residences with faulty new plumbing that is just as inefficient as before , city comptroller alan g hevesi charged yesterday the city spent 270 million on the program , which is intended to limit water consumption as environmental officials are trying to avoid making billions of dollars in investments to maintain the water supply property owners received up to 240 apiece from the city to spend on a toilet that uses 16 gallons per flush , replacing older models that often use 5 gallons the administration of mayor rudolph w giuliani , which began the program in 1994 , assailed mr hevesi s report administration officials said that the new toilets had already cut water consumption in the city by 60 million gallons a day , or about 5 percent , adding that some complaints in such a large undertaking were inevitable daily water use in the city averages 13 billion gallons the administration called a press conference where it introduced executives from real estate trade groups , as well as the general counsel for the environmental defense fund , all of whom hailed the program mr hevesi , a democrat often mentioned as a possible mayoral candidate next year , acknowledged that the program had lowered water use but he said in a report that his auditors had found that the city s department of environmental protection had done a poor job of supervising the project at one building in harlem , the superintendent , oscar rodriguez , said his own experience supported mr hevesi s conclusions mr rodriguez , who works at 69 tiemann place , said he had thrown out five of the new toilets after they broke when he tried to unclog them none of these are any good , he said i tell everyone to keep a plunger right next to the toilet to clear it out mr hevesi said some contractors had charged the full 240 even though their costs were far less because they installed substandard toilets some toilets performed so badly that they had to be flushed several times , so they used as much water as older models , he said allegations have also arisen that plumbing companies paid bribes to landlords to obtain contracts for the toilets the manhattan district attorney s office said it was investigating those claims mr hevesi said new , inefficient toilets cost property owners about 9 million a year that they were supposed to have saved on water bills the city itself lost more than 7 million , often through overcharging by plumbers , he said he noted that the auditors based that figure on the first 400 , 000 toilets installed when the program ends , probably later this year , about 15 million lowflush toilets will have been put in , about a third of all the toilets in the city , officials said no matter how wonderful a program is , it cannot minimize the significance of a management failure , mr hevesi said in an interview but the giuliani administration accused the comptroller of grandstanding he is doing the city a disservice , and he is really doing a disservice to the environmental community in this city by not pointing out what a great , wonderful , success program that we have had , said the first deputy mayor , peter j powers jim tripp , general counsel for the environmental defense fund , noted that under federal law , all new toilets must be the low flush type what is unique and remarkable about new york city s program is not waiting for years and years and decades for old toilets to be gradually be replaced , but to be replaced quicker , mr tripp said this has had enormous , enormously beneficial environmental consequences photo comptroller alan g hevesi says that many of the lowflowtoilets installed in a city program were substandard or broken , like this one \( andrea mohin the new york times \)
hartford , march 8 despite angry criticism from black lawmakers , gov john g rowland today appointed a group of 10 judges to the state trial courts that did not include a single black member over the last 10 years , black legislators have repeatedly called for more black judges and been frustrated over the small progress they have made according to a study by the fund for modern courts , there were seven black judges in the state as of december 1985 today , a directory of minority judges published by the american bar association shows 10 black judges serving in the state s various courts , while the number of judges has increased by at least 28 the last time we were at this juncture , there were representations that we would do better next time , state senator eric coleman , a hartford democrat , who is black , said in a senate debate on the appointments today the next time has come around and we 're not doing any better mr rowland , who split the 10 appointments with the democratic speaker of the house , thomas d ritter , said that he , too , was frustrated by the absence of a black appointee , and that he was committed to increasing the number of black judges the problem , he said , is that appointments must come from a list selected by a nonpartisan judicial selection commission , which state officials say receives few applications from black candidates of the 10 superior court judges mr rowland appointed today , there was one woman and one hispanic judge they will be added to a roster of 164 superior court judges that includes 6 black judges , 2 hispanic judges and 26 women about 8 percent of the state population is black , and about 65 percent is hispanic many other states have had trouble increasing black representation on the bench benjamin aranda 3d , a california municipal court judge who prepares the american bar association s directory of minority judges , said that in california there had been virtually no increase in the number of minority judges in four years at the same time , judge aranda said , both new york city and detroit have seen impressive increases in the number of black municipal judges in new york state , judges on the supreme court , the state s lowest trial court , are elected according to new york court officials , 48 of the 354 supreme court justices are black there s no excuse for not increasing the number , judge aranda said any research today will show that the number of minority lawyers today is much greater than it was 20 years ago at the crux of the debate over the appointments was the question of why so few black lawyers applied to the selection commission to be judges mr rowland and others , including prominent democrats and top court officials , have said that minority lawyers are not interested in the jobs because they make more money in private practice than they would as judges as of july 1 , superior court judges will receive an annual salary of 97 , 486 that will increase next year to 100 , 411 successful minority lawyers are earning more than judges , said judge aaron ment , the chief court administrator many have growing families that would make it difficult to accept a lower salary dean pagani , governor rowland s spokesman , echoed that view it s hard to find minority candidates , he said , because many do n't want to leave lucrative positions in private firms to sit on the bench but black lawmakers dismissed this assertion that is pure junk , said state representative william r dyson , a new haven democrat , who is black are you telling me that the only ones who want to be public servants are white folk and that none of them are lawyers in private practice who are taking a salary cut \? mr dyson cited a different reason for the small numbers black lawyers have had such little success in winning judgeships in the past that they did not believe it was worth trying i 've had six to eight people call me in the last two weeks saying that they 're interested , mr dyson said to a tee , their comment is , i did n't think i would get anywhere , so why bother despite these objections , the 10 nominees were overwhelmingly approved earlier this week in the state house of representatives , with only 7 of the 151 members voting against all the nominees they were approved unanimously today in the state senate , with the three black senators all saying that they had nothing against the individuals who had been selected mr rowland chose his 10 appointments from a list of 83 names , including at least one black lawyer , recommended by the selection commission both mr rowland and mr ritter had agreed to appoint william holden , a bridgeport public defender who is black , but his nomination was delayed because of questions about whether he misused a state car
science and dissent in postmao china the politics of knowledge by h lyman miller 370 pp seattle university of washington press cloth , 38 paper , 1895 in 1937 , just before the outbreak of the sinojapanese war , the great danish physicist niels bohr visited china s famous beauty spot of hangzhou to lecture on the nucleus of the atom bohr s host in hangzhou was the chinese physicist wang ganchang , who later helped create china s nuclear weapons program mr wang , born in 1907 , received his phd at the university of berlin for his work under lise meitner on beta rays , and had just been invited to join the faculty at zhejiang university in hangzhou an enraptured member of the audience was a local 17yearold middle school student named xu liangying , who was just developing a passion for physics and was later to become the definitive translator of einstein s works into chinese as a student in the early 1950 s , fang lizhi , who was born in 1937 , was also to develop a love of physics , and later of astrophysics and cosmology in the first months of 1989 , 52 years after bohr s visit , the lives of these three chinese physicists were to be strangely drawn together as they individually decided on the courageous and unpredictable step of signing open letters to deng xiaoping and the senior leaders of the communist party protesting the unfair treatment of china s dissidents and requesting greater guarantees of basic freedoms these letters constituted an apparently small yet potent part of the complex mix of dissatisfactions within china that were to explode in the spring and summer in the colossal demonstrations in tiananmen square and the subsequent massacre of civilians by government forces the goal that h lyman miller , a professor in the school of advanced international studies at johns hopkins university , has set himself in this deeply interesting and closely argued book is to explore how these three \( and many other \) members of the chinese scientific elite embarked on a course that took them in the decade of the 80 s from their world of intellectual diversity , via ideological deviations , to a posture of open political dissent as mr miller notes one of the great ironies of the deng era has been that scientific dissidence arose in political opposition to a regime that from the beginning attached a high priority to science and technology , worked actively to rebuild china s civilian science community and sought persistently to enhance the standing of scientists as a social group these policies made many scientists outspoken supporters of the dengist reforms at the outset gradually , however , the reforms revealed a conflict of ultimate goals between the regime and some scientists in addition , successive changes in orientation , structure and funding of the civilian science establishment brought new strains and problems not anticipated by the reform leadership what these changes meant was that for many chinese scientists the deng xiaoping era saw a setback after great expectations , in which their incomes shrank proportionately to other intellectuals' and to factory workers' , their research funds were cut back , the worth of their contributions was devalued and new facilities the government had seemed to promise them evaporated as early as 1981 a sardonic report in a shanghai newspaper observed some research centers are dubbed 'three no' centers \( meaning no research subjects , no funds and no personnel \) , some are known as 'three diminutive' centers \( meaning one room , one seal and one empty shelf \) , while others are styled 'threemachine' centers \( one mimeograph , one stapler and one telephone \) as the 80 s progressed , the emphasis on scientists' financing their own research , and arranging for their own tieins to industry to supplement their salaries , became a part of the national process those who could not adjust , or would not , were left out in the cold it was probably inevitable that in the minds of many scientists these frustrations should prompt a careful reexamination of the relevance of marxismleninismmao zedong thought deng and the communist party still insisted such beliefs were the guiding light for the new socialism with chinese characteristics that was to make china a fullfledged modern power but this meant a continuing reliance on the outdated observations on natural science made by marx and , especially , by engels , with not particularly helpful elaborations by lenin and the soviet theorist andrei zhdanov , who was so influential under stalin and whose approach was also followed by mao since it was common enough knowledge that none of these theorists had any profound grasp even of the science of their own day , the defense of the relevance of their insights had to be argued by the party on methodological grounds this defense of marxist science was spearheaded through the field called natural dialectics in science and dissent in postmao china , mr miller summarizes the premises of this field the heart of natural dialectics , as chinese theoreticians argued the theory in the deng era , are three universal laws and accompanying categories that are applied in constructing a unified picture of nature the law of the transformation of quantitative into qualitative change asserts that change occurs in qualitative leaps as a result of accumulated quantitative change the law of the unity and contradiction of opposites holds that all entities are a combination of oppositions , whose mutual interaction drives change within such entities and in the world as a whole the law of the negation of the negation posits that each successive stage of development contains within itself the seed of its own destruction and replacement by a new stage that contains elements , on a higher plane , of the stage preceding it
east rutherford , nj behind the buffalo bills' bench at giants stadium last night were six huge fans , the type you might see on a movie set in hollywood where producers work to create a windy effect these fans are popular in football now they are called cool zone and they do just that on a hot , muggy night keep you cool the problem was , it was not that hot it was not that muggy it was a tolerable night , but not for the bills they would make a few plays and then several of their starters would jog to the bench , straight to the fans fans they brought from buffalo early on , just when the bills looked like they might get hot , they got cold stone cold that changed before it did , the giants showed they are not as weak as suspected let s give them credit they took the heat they did not need a cool zone all night long no huge fans for the giants no frills we had them scared , said giants safety maurice douglass oh , really \? yeah , really , said bruce smith , the bills' ferocious defensive end we were wondering what was going on so was bills coach marv levy you heard that the giants were n't good , levy said our players heard that they read the stuff that has been happening here , how everyone has been all over them perfect trap i told the team over and over , you believe that and you will be in trouble but it happened anyway the giants came out and took it to us one play led to another and the emotion and momentum of the thing kept swinging thank goodness we 've got a team that s been there before been there and back buffalo s 2320 overtime victory in the season kickoff for both teams reassured the bills that they have talent and spirit and a backbone unlike most teams in the national football league for the giants , the lessons learned were more modest ones it s a long season with a lot yet to happen , but this will build our character and make us better , said amani toomer , the sensational and classy rookie from michigan maybe the giants earned some respect tonight but more than respect , we want to win this was the giants' start a 1yard run by thurman thomas jim kelly sacked for a 4yard loss jim kelly sacked for a 12yard loss rodney hampton nastily stiffarming cornerback thomas smith on a tough 12yard run giants jumping ahead , 30 to be in this game , let alone to win it , the giants needed to pull off something they did not do last season , when they were 511 , something they did not do in this preseason , when they were 13 , and maybe even something they had never done before they did all of those things when toomer returned a punt 87 yards for the longest puntreturn touchdown in giants history that made it 100 in favor of the home team the giants , after fullback charles way s 37yard catch and score , increased that lead to 170 with 7 minutes 27 seconds left before halftime but buffalo would be buffalo back they stormed big play after big play bills win still , how could the giants come so far in so little time \? credit coach dan reeves great game plan credit his players good execution too bad the bills caught on to the giants' blitz and to the giants' offensive weaknesses a team either gets better or worse which will the giants do \? give 'em three more weeks , just like us , and then you 'll know about them , said john butler , the bills' general manager the same applies to us we are a veteran , proven team , smith said of himself and his teammates and the giants \? they will get better , he said that is going to be a good team up and down hot and cold that is the way it will go for the giants sometimes , in a season of growing pains for a young team , it will simply go stone cold before warming again hey , it s only one night one game but with the jets getting trashed in denver earlier in the day , at least there was one new york pro football team worth watching during the season openers for giants fans , there is hope where before , in most circles , there was none and for new yorkers \? that s cool
san diego , aug 13 former gov richard d lamm , ross perot s only rival for the reform party presidential nomination , cannot cast a paper ballot for himself , because he has yet to receive one in the mail i never got my ballot , mr lamm , who was governor of colorado for three terms , said today in an interview mr lamm had just completed a speech and taken part in an issues forum with some 300 high school students and young adults attending the first national youth conventions at san diego city college , not far from the republican national convention site my daughter never got her ballot , he added my wife got her ballot my father did n't get his ballot mr lamm said that he was not in a position to say whether his family s experience was an indicator of widespread problems in the mailing of more than one million paper ballots to reform party supporters , or just an anomaly however , he said he had ruled out the possibility that his predicament had resulted from anything underhanded but i worry about administrative snafus , he said there are errors of commission and errors of omission and from an election standpoint , either one can undercut the credibility of the whole process speaking to the young delegates at the issues convention today , mr lamm encouraged them to examine national issues carefully and become involved in shaping public policy with the same fervor and enthusiasm that he said he had when president john f kennedy took office in the 1960 s there really is n't any better time in all of history for any of you to be born , he said today , however , mr lamm momentarily put aside his interest in winning the new party s nomination , and his desire to press for an overhaul of medicare and other federal middleclass entitlements he concentrated instead on the future of the reform party , noting that a badly flawed nomination process could undermine the party s chances of being taken seriously and becoming a major political force in the united states over the next decade i am not only looking at november , he said , adding that he and his running mate , ed zschau , a former republican congressman from california , want the reform party to offer a viable alternative to the two major parties , while at the same time encouraging those parties to reform themselves we are into this to build over a decade , not over a threemonth period , he said as of monday 11 days after national reform party officials said that ballots were being mailed mr lamm had not received a paper ballot for the reform party , nor had his daughter , heather , nor his father , arnold each ballot includes a personal identification number , and none of the three can simply elect to vote by telephone or through the internet options being provided to members of the reform party until they have their partyissued pin number to validate the vote of the party s 14 million members and supporters , about 113 million are to receive paper ballots and pin numbers , party officials said sharon holman , a spokeswoman for the reform party , said that mr lamm s plight as a party supporter reflected the challenge faced by data processing workers at the party s dallas headquarters who had to try to decipher illegible names , guess addresses and figure out other vital data , and then enter it all into a computer to create ballot mailing lists ms holman listed colorado , mr lamm s home state , connecticut and pennsylvania as states in which the petitions used to get the party on the fall ballot were often incomplete and difficult to read in a telephone interview from dallas , ms holman said that she had on her desk a copy of the petition that mr lamm signed she said that she was able to read his signature , but that she was unable to decipher much of anything else asked what mr lamm should do if he wanted to vote before the aug 16 or 17 deadline , ms holman said , nothing she added , we do n't feel comfortable fooling with the process and sending out additional ballots ms holman said that a review of a computerized mailing list by officials at party headquarters found that mr lamm s ballot was mailed on aug 5 , part of the last batch to go out the address on the envelope was 5401 e dagta , denver , she said mr lamm s correct address , she said , is 5401 e dakota ms holman said that individual postal workers often decide on their own when to deliver bulk mail , further confounding the timely delivery of ballots similar problems overshadowed the mailin candidate preference survey that was used to decide which individuals could compete for the new party s presidential nomination since that survey was sent out in july , the lamm camp has expressed doubts about the ability of the new party , founded and financed by mr perot , to administer the nomination process and simultaneously serve mr perot s needs as a candidate
it certainly is not as well known as older , well established cousins like the standard poor s 500 index or the dow jones industrial average , but for the last 18 months a littlenoticed market measure has outstripped the performance of both inaugurated in december 1994 , and available on bloomberg financial markets , the bloomberg color of money index tracks the performance of nine publicly traded companies that are owned and operated by africanamericans none of these companies , which collectively had revenue of less than 500 million last year , is a household name but investors more concerned about results than fame would do well to consider that so far this year the index of these stocks has risen 393 percent , compared with a gain of 116 percent in the dow and a 91 percent rise in the s p 500 since its inception , the index has performed even better relative to betterknown peer groups from the end of december 1994 through yesterday , the bloomberg color of money index is up 928 percent , versus a 464 percent rise in the s p 500 and 489 percent rise in the dow kelvin boston , who produces the color of money , a personal finance show syndicated on black entertainment television and pbs , was a moving force in creating the index he found a willing collaborator in burton waddy , a media syndication executive at bloomberg the connection with bloomberg offers a vehicle through which traders and investors can get an idea about what is happening with publicly traded africanamerican companies , mr boston said mr boston , a former financial planner for ids american express , added that most africanamericans have been taught that investing in stocks is like gambling that is just not true , and through the index we will be able to share with the public some exciting stories two of the nine stocks in the index , united american healthcare and bet holdings , the parent company of black entertainment television , trade on the new york stock exchange two others , pyrocap international and american shared hospital services , are on the american stock exchange the remaining five envirotest systems , carver federal savings bank , caraco pharmaceutical laboratories , granite broadcasting and ault are on nasdaq some of these companies have produced staggering returns so far this year pyrocap , a tiny specialty chemical manufacturer , has seen its stock price double so far this year that run came after a twomonth suspension from trading on the american stock exchange that ended feb 15 and shares of ault , a designer and manufacturer of external power supplies and battery chargers , have surged almost 240 percent but others have not done as well , despite the rally in the stock market this year carver federal is off more than 12 percent on the year while caraco pharmaceutical is down 19 percent to guard against big swings in the index when some of the largercapitalized stocks like bet holdings and granite broadcasting made big moves , the nine companies in the index have been given the same statistical weighting \( the dow and s p 500 are weighted by size or capitalization , the price times the number of shares \) but this equal weighting also allowed a lowpriced stock like pyrocap to push the index a lot higher with a relatively small price move in dollars pyrocap s jump this year is based on a move from 11875 , to 2375 yesterday five of the stocks were trading at less than 5 a share at the beginning of the year and four still are while part of the impetus behind the index s creation was to further the financial education of africanamericans and other minorities , there are other , more hardboiled reasons as well i see this as a business decision , said tony chapelle , publisher and editor of securities pro , a monthly newsletter that tracks developments relating to minorityowned and operated businesses for a variety of reasons , investors have a need to know about various market niches and there are investors out there who have clients who are predisposed to investing in blackowned companies mr chapelle said that liquidity was a problem with some companies in the index , given their small size , and that could make it harder to trade the stocks to be sure , there is some risk , he said do n't jump in unless you have done the necessary research steve washington , a portfolio supervisor to the american diversity growth trust , a unit investment trust that invests in a combination of africanamerican owned companies and companies that make products popular with minority consumers , has made investments in the five biggest stocks in the index bet , caraco , granite , united american health and carver federal this trust was set up to capitalize on the economic and demographic growth of minority populations , he said minority populations and urban consumers are growing faster than the population as a whole that is a legitimate theme for any investor , and can add to the performance of your portfolio

san antonio if magic johnson s return has delivered any unambiguous message , it is that basketball is about none of the topics generally covered at allstar weekend it is not about global growth , or sizable increases in cable ratings or logos being plastered on shirts and shoes it is not longdistance shootouts or slamdunk contests it is not about tradebrokering agents , like david falk , or handsomely paid commissioners , like david stern basketball is about making the pass , about finding a means to connect moving dots most everything else , with the obvious exception of michael jordan , has the potential to become repetitiously banal the smart and wellexecuted pass , fortunately , never gets old that was never more obvious than last night , when we were reminded that only the genius passers can tie a pretty bow around this highpowered package of statdriven stars magic was missed much more than dennis rodman could be after 20 million rebounds so was the retired isiah thomas , who was always ready to match magic , allstar nolook for allstar nolook the eastern conference s 129118 victory was routinely athletic , nothing more jordan hit enough jumpers to satisfy the eager mostvaluableplayer voters shaquille o'neal , former san antonio scholastic star , dunked on david robinson , the spurs' franchise center the teams combined for 40 3point shots and made 8 highlightreel material was sparse , except for six minutes of the first quarter , when jason kidd put on a brilliant passing show , blind passes in all directions that were as pragmatic as they were spectacular then phil jackson , defensive guru and coaching killjoy , trapped dallas s visionary point guard as he crossed halfcourt i thought this was an allstar game , kidd said later , scratching his head kidd , the west starter , soon got lost in a threeway pointguard rotation seattle coach george karl said last week he thought his man , gary payton , deserved to start payton played 28 minutes to kidd s 22 and john stockton s 18 kidd had more assists \( 10 \) than payton and stockton combined penny hardaway showed magiclike flashes for the east , but he is instinctively more of a scoring guard than anything else terrell brandon was cautiously efficient , your basic cleveland cavalier this game needs more clever kidds in its playground future possibilities damon stoudamire and brent barry stoudamire , thomas s protege in toronto , was the deserving most valuable player of saturday s rookie game , in which barry , the third of four rick barry boys , whipped the ball around a la kidd then his two foulline launchings stunningly earned him the slamdunk title and put him in the aerial company of jordan and julius erving some bright marketing executive will be filming barry slamming on woody harrelson any day now , selling a sneaker with the ebullient chant of yes , we can ! stockton , the league s career leader in assists , was more impressed with barry , the visionary passer he understands that the pat rileyhubie brown mentality of lobbing the ball to the post and powering up could make baseball the national pastime again and forever i like to see basketball played right , and right does n't necessarily mean old , stockton said but some things should never change the ball and the bodies moving around , the point guard creating , finding the open man , up and down the floor i think that s pretty the uncharismatic stockton , who for years passed in magic s shadow , now stands in kidd s in his throwback shorts that look like hot pants compared with everyone else s , he does n't win popularity contests , or the vote by the kiddie fans who choose the stars basketball people always want him around , though and scorers , of course , which is why he s back on the olympic team that is headed to atlanta next summer kidd is campaigning for one of the two unfilled olympic positions he did n't hurt himself in dallas s last game before the break , torching stockton and the utah defense for 25 assists , claiming that he was in a zone passing the ball or last night , for that matter unless magic sheds 25 pounds sometime soon , kidd is going to be basketball s most electric innovator for some time with this guy , it s like it is with magic , charles barkley said you have to be looking at him every second kidd had to remind barkley of that when the trap began to come he was jogging with his head down , kidd said i just told him to keep his head up and what did barkley say \? i hear you , son in his second season , kidd has matured to where he was n't going to let those 25 assists go to his head he may have won the fan celebrity poll , but stockton has been connecting those moving dots for 13 years kidd , in his second season , said he 'd be happy to carry john s water on the olympic team magic , of course , wants to be part of the atlanta party , too some say that would be unfair to mitch richmond and shawn kemp , excellent players in the prime of their careers too bad there are more than enough guys around to shoot the jumper and dunk the ball there s a premium on genius passers basketball needs as many as it can get photo john stockton , center , dishing off a nolook pass through thedefense of patrick ewing , left , and vin baker \( noren trotman nbaallsport \)
dobbs ferry herbert lau is a man of science who left mainland china for the united states to earn his doctorate in analytical chemistry for the last 20 years , he has worked in medical laboratories , most recently as the chemical director at the corning metpath laboratory in buffalo but last month , dr lau left his home in buffalo for a small dormitory room on the campus of mercy college here he is enrolled in the college s first training program for oriental medicine and acupuncture , an ancient practice , which holds that diseases and injuries can be treated by using tiny needles to stimulate the flow of energy along pathways in the body called meridians what compelled the biochemist to study acupuncture \? for one thing , dr lau was ready for a career change he felt that his days as a research scientist were numbered because of downsizing and then he had an opportunity to witness the benefits of acupuncture close to home i was not a believer in oriental medicine when i came to the united states to study western science years ago , dr lau said but my thinking about acupuncture changed this past year when i observed an acupuncturist in practice not only did he help relieve my wife s tendonitis , when other treatments had failed , but i was very impressed with the number of patients he treated effectively for conditions ranging from arthritis and sciatica to obesity and drug addiction when the acupuncturist said he was looking for someone to take over his practice when he retired , dr lau decided to change fields he researched several training programs and chose mercy college because he believed that a general degreegranting college would have the highest standards in fact , mercy college is the first regionally accredited , general degreegranting college to offer a combined bachelor s of science in health science and a master s degree in professional studies in acupuncture and oriental medicine the state department of education approved the advanceddegree program in may but the groundwork for the program began last november when a development committee at the college identified acupuncture as a growing but underrepresented health care profession in a proposal to the state education department , the committee said that although new york state had licensed more than 700 acupuncturists in the last five years , large areas of the state lacked practitioners this comes at a time when major managedcare providers , including oxford and wellcare , had plans to include acupuncturists in their networks mercy college , it argued , could help fill that void william prensky , a licensed acupuncturist who is also president of the american academy of acupuncture and oriental medicine and chairman of the acupuncture society of new york , helped develop the program at mercy college and serves as its director it is very exciting to be associated with this educational program , the first to be offered in a mainstream college setting , dr prensky said i think it reflects the national trend toward acceptance of acupuncture as a healing art and bodes well for the strong evidence that supports acupuncture as an effective therapeutic tool for orthomuscular problems , pain management and a host of other health problems dr prensky said the training program will provide the most comprehensive and rigorous study of acupuncture and oriental medicine available in the united states the program will require more credit hours of study than any other , he said , and it is the only one that offers studies of acupuncture and oriental medicine along with other health sciences students in the program will be taught basic concepts and techniques in western medicine and traditional oriental medicine there are 27 accredited schools in the country that provide acupuncture training for those who are not doctors , dr prensky said , but none offer an undergraduate and advanced degree from a regionally accredited , generaldegree granting college he said the majority of training programs were on the west coast most students in mercy s first class are pursuing a master s degree because they already have undergraduate degrees and backgrounds in health and science clorinda buenafefarina , who formerly served as director of respiratory therapy at the new york foundling hospital in manhattan , said she enrolled because she was disillusioned with managedcare policies i wanted to explore a discipline that focused on the patient s emotional and physical needs without looking at costeffectiveness as the basis for treatment decisions , ms buenafefarina said and i like the fact that the practice deals with prevention as well as treatment therapies for illness and injury another student , arkady kliner , a dental technician who dispels his own headaches through meditation , said he has always been attracted to nontraditional forms of medicine finding this program is like discovering a treasure behind a hidden door , mr kliner said it is why i am willing to drive to the campus a threehour round trip from my home in east brunswick , nj dr prensky said that in addition to having topnotch students in the program , the faculty consists of licensed acupuncturists with wellestablished practices they include darien lamb , a registered nurse who received her training in acupuncture in california and has a practice in new rochelle , and dr kyooseok ahn , who joined the program as a visiting professor from seoul and is president of the oriental medicine research institute in seoul the mercy college program includes nine semesters of study , which can be completed in three years in the first year , the students study theories and practices of acupuncture , and in the second and final year , they work in a clinic supervised by senior faculty members the mercy college training clinic , the location of which has yet to be determined , will be open to the public nationally , acupuncturists are regulated or licensed as providers of health care services in 33 states according to the american association of acupuncture and oriental medicine , there are about 8 , 000 licensed practitioners nationwide , 3 , 000 in california , the state with the longest history of licensed practice new york state provides licensing for medical doctors and those who are not to become a certified acupuncturist , medical doctors must take 300 hours of training in acupuncture medical schools like new york medical college provide acupuncture training for medical doctors and dentists to become licensed in new york as an acupuncturist who is not a doctor , students must complete a minimum of two years of training at a recognized school and pass the certifying examination given by the national commission for the certification of acupuncturists despite the growing acceptance of acupuncture , many doctors dismiss its therapies as unproved and unscientific chief among the critics is the national council against health fraud , an organization of doctors based in loma linda , calif still , a recent ruling by the food and drug administration has opened the way for more insurers to cover acupuncture treatments in april , after an investigation , the federal drug administration approved acupuncture needles for general use by licensed , registered or certified practitioners although the fda does not evaluate medical procedures , it does rule on the instruments used to perform them photo darien lamb , an acupuncture instructor at mercy , treats carol l moore , above , and

four years after ross perot took his first run at the presidency , a remarkable odyssey that saw him capture nearly one in every five votes cast in the 1992 election , the texas billionaire is once again a candidate for the white house , atop the ticket of a party he founded and bankrolled as he did last time , mr perot has embarked on a campaign that relies on spare public appearances , scripted infomercials and his usual litany of texas homilies but his reentry on the political stage last month also brought a fresh round of something else that marked his last presidential run controversy within only days of mr perot s official entry into the race for the reform party nomination , his chief rival , former gov richard d lamm of colorado , asserted that he had such iron control over the party machinery that the balloting might be rigged when the voting was over and mr perot had indeed won handily , mr lamm refused to support his presidential bid i will endorse ross perot as a prophet , he said i will endorse ross perot as paul revere i will endorse him as prescient i will not endorse him as president although mr lamm did not elaborate on his decision , he is not the first to raise questions about whether mr perot is suited to be president in the 1992 campaign , mr perot was dogged by questions not only about his temperament , but also about decisions he had made as a politician and , earlier , as a businessman mr perot has , his critics say , an inordinate need for control , which is perhaps not unusual for a man who is a selfmade billionaire the critics have also suggested that he has a penchant for intrigue and conspiracy theories , which has at times caused him to threaten those whom he sees as his enemies they also have questioned whether mr perot has followed and benefited from the same standards of corporate behavior that he has insisted are corrupt and should be changed as the texan runs again for the presidency , a number of such questions remain despite railing against the corrupting evils of political donations , mr perot has given many tens of thousands of dollars to political candidates over the years and was once the single largest contributor to congressional candidates in the nation even though he has denounced lobbyists in their alligator shoes , he and his top aides have successfully lobbied to advance his own fortunes his successes include securing tax breaks for a huge airport project on land owned by his family and fighting off a texas state plan to cancel a major contract with one of his companies his apparent fondness for hiring private investigators has brought him an unwanted nickname , inspector perot , and he has raised eyebrows by detailing conspiracy theories , some involving threats to his own life , like a bizarre and neverproven accusation that a group of vietnamesebacked black panthers had once sneaked onto his property to kill him perhaps most damaging of all , many voters say they remain deeply bothered by mr perot s abrupt exit from the presidential race in the summer of 1992 , followed by a surprise reentry and the shocking explanation that he had left in the first place because of a republicanbacked dirty tricks campaign to disrupt his daughter s wedding even as mr perot insisted for nearly three months that he had pulled out of that race , he continued to spend heavily at that time to get his name on the ballot only this week did mr perot choose his vicepresidential candidate , dr pat choate , an economist so far , public opinion polls suggest that his campaign has not generated the same curiosity or enthusiasm it did four years ago various polls show that mr perot is the preference of as few as 4 to 7 percent of the voters , and even his paid television commercials have drawn ratings that are a bare shadow of what his wisecracks , aphorisms and famous charts drew four years ago during the political season so far , mr perot has shown no inclination to address the doubts that have been raised about him you ca n't confront it head on , said gordon s black , a rochester , ny , pollster and informal perot adviser it s sort of like having to say , 'i'm not a liar i'm not a cheat i'm not a philanderer' the very fact you have to do that reinforces the idea that you might be what is he supposed to say 'i am not crazy i am not unstable \? ' you ca n't do that gerald posner , author of citizen perot \( random house , 1996 \) , a new , unauthorized biography of the texan , said mr perot wants to be a sort of climatecontrolled candidate mr posner continued he gets shorttempered he knows he does n't handle these questions well so his solution this time is to stay above it all , and nobody yet seems to be raising a ruckus that he is n't really dealing with these issues but the questions are there here is a guide to many of them , with comments that mr perot has made about them in the past he declined requests for an interview for this article the 1992 race political decisions and consequences
after picking apart some of the wadded remains of the cockpit of trans world airlines flight 800 , investigators concluded yesterday that the catastrophic explosion that destroyed the boeing 747 most likely did not originate inside the cockpit or in the electronics bay beneath it they were partly persuaded by a surprising discovery found in the ton of wreckage that had been the jet s cockpit the circles of glass that covered many of the cockpit dials , and even a light bulb above a staircase that led to the plane s upper deck , had somehow survived the crash intact you have this mass of wreckage and yet things from that area are relatively the way they were before the accident , said robert t francis , vice chairman of the national transportation safety board there is no indication at this point of anything in that area that would give cause for concern in terms of something having initiated there a senior investigator who looked at the cockpit wreckage yesterday said that one of the instruments that shows the plane s altitude , an altimeter , was frozen with a reading of 13 , 100 feet altimeters are mechanically driven instruments that do not depend on electricity to work the finding suggests that the mechanical components continued to work for several seconds after the initial explosion , at about 13 , 700 feet , had knocked out the plane s electrical system and flight data recorder federal investigators continued their search for the cause of the crash yesterday , the 20th day since twa flight 800 exploded in midair off long island and plunged into the atlantic , killing all 230 people on board on the seas and on the shore , investigators said they made a modest amount of progress , though they still have not determined if the crash was caused by a bomb , a missile attack or a mechanical malfunction at the former grumman hangar in calverton , li , investigators yesterday began piecing together the fractured parts of the airplane they also pulled about onethird of the cockpit wreckage off the oneton ball of metal , essentially unwrapping it james k kallstrom , the assistant director of the fbi s new york office , said he had sent many agents who had been working in suffolk county back to their home offices criminal investigators are anxious for the cause to be determined , he said , adding we are in a bit of a waiting pattern and in the waters off shinnecock inlet , salvage workers turned their attention to the area where the first pieces of flight 800 , including pieces of luggage , settled in an area about one mile southwest of the stretch of ocean floor where the cockpit remains were retrieved over the weekend the area is called debris area three , but that is something of a misnomer in fact , investigators view it as the first area , closest to kennedy international airport , where wreckage and luggage first fell officials said the length of the debris line stretched about five miles northeast , roughly parallel to flight 800 s flight path navy rear adm edward kristensen said that there were isolated instances of luggage being seen in area three neither admiral kristensen nor mr francis would comment on the significance of the discovery , or on whether it bolstered the theory that a bomb , secreted in the forward cargo hold in a piece of luggage , had brought down the plane , blowing pieces of luggage out of the cargo hold i'm not going to speculate , mr francis said however , several investigators , speaking on condition of anonymity , said yesterday that they believe the luggage and debris found in the area are critical to proving whether a bomb or missile destroyed the airplane one official said last night , you can not overemphasize the importance of the debris and luggage recovered from area three divers began collecting pieces of wreckage , luggage and pieces of clothing in debris area three yesterday , placing them in baskets that were then lifted to the surface a law enforcement official said last night that fbi agents wanted to test each piece of baggage retrieved from the area for bomb residue the recovered pieces will first be tested for forensic evidence at the grumman hangar and , if they provide preliminary positive results , will be sent to the fbi laboratory in washington for further testing in the bombing of an airindia jumbo jet off the irish coast in 1985 , a sevenmile debris line was found at the bottom of the irish sea investigators said they were struck by the many similarities between the airindia debris line and twa s fivemile line in the crash of airindia flight 182 , the first chunks of debris came from the plane s underbelly , including pieces of luggage , which was followed by the cockpit and nose of the plane the last debris field contained wreckage from the tail of the aircraft although no forensic evidence of an explosive was ever found , investigators concluded , based on circumstantial evidence , that a bomb exploded in a piece of luggage located in the forward cargo hold there are many parallels between that flight and our flight , one senior investigator said last night officials said none of the remaining 35 victims' bodies were recovered yesterday at yesterday s news briefing , navy comdr bobbie scholley , who dove with a partner off the navy ship grapple monday evening , said she was lowered 120 feet below the ocean surface on a platform , settling in an area that contained the cockpit and the plane s front section you literally cannot step off the stage without stepping on parts of the aircraft , she said it s completely a tangled mess the visibility is very hazy the stuff directly in the bottom i pretty much had to get on my hands and knees to look at it close enough to decipher what it was diagram pieces of twa 800 recovered so far federal investigators looking into the crash of twa flight 800 believe that a bomb may have exploded near the front of the plane , scattering luggage into the sea the plane , they believe , continued to fly east , and broke apart , leaving debris in two distinct areas chart shows pieces of flight 800 collected so far \( source national transportation

isaiah berlin by john gray 189 pp princeton , nj princeton university press 1995 isaiah berlin occupies a very prominent position in british cultural and intellectual life , but it eludes simple description he has been the head of an oxford college , a director of the royal opera house and a recipient of innumerable honorary degrees , a knighthood and the order of merit politically , he is almost more british than the british an urbane liberal who nonetheless applauded the way the postwar welfare state expanded the freedoms of the less welloff , a fierce opponent of communist tyranny who has never thought that the sins of our enemies excused our own injustices and illiberalisms it is his liberalism that john gray s isaiah berlin focuses on , and it is as a liberal thinker that most students encounter him but he has not stayed in the study for more than half a century he has been at the center of british public life , ever since the foreign office sent him here during the war , to explain the british to the americans and vice versa the second task he performed in dispatches that winston churchill valued almost as much for their literary style as for their political insight yet his greatest service to his adopted country may have been to bring to british political and intellectual life the sensibilities of a very different world born in riga , latvia , in 1909 , sir isaiah saw the russian revolutions of 1917 as a child in st petersburg he came to britain as a boy of 11 and at once made himself at home without ever quite suggesting that england really was home he dazzled his contemporaries at school and college in 1932 he became the first jew to be elected a fellow of all souls in the college s 500year history but he was always an exotic plant in the english landscape during the 1930 s he was an upandcoming young philosopher in the analytical mode , but he wrote more about opera than about epistemology and was welcomed everywhere for conversational talents more familiar in new york or paris than in london after the war , he abandoned academic philosophy for intellectual history and political theory in the early years of encounter magazine he published some wonderful essays on the 19thcentury russian critics and theorists alexander herzen and v g belinsky , figures whom almost nobody in britain had heard of in those days he mixed biographical , literary and political analysis in a fashion that few academic writers dared to do , and those who cared to understand him learned that among the evils perpetrated by the leninist autocracy one was its extinction of the indigenous tradition of radical , populist liberalism exemplified by herzen in essays on a host of philosophical and political thinkers , sir isaiah taught the lesson that john gray s little book explains and analyzes beware the oversimplifiers , mistrust the prophet who comes offering the keys to utopia , respect intelligence but distrust reason with a capital r this is what one might call the negative theme of both sir isaiah and isaiah berlin throughout his postwar career sir isaiah was in , but not wholly of , the academy certainly he sometimes wrote on the standard themes of political theory he was , after all , the chichele professor of social and political thought in oxford , and two concepts of liberty , the inaugural lecture he delivered in 1957 , spawned a critical secondary literature of immense proportions but his preferred mode of argument was indirect , biographical , historical , almost pictorial among his five volumes of collected essays , only one , concepts and categories , consists of essays on familiar philosophical topics personal impressions , which some readers find the most immediately engaging volume of the five , is just what its title suggests commemorative essays on contemporaries , from great public figures to relatively littleknown oxford friends and colleagues but even these personal recollections are the work of an intellectual historian ideas come to life in the lives of individuals , and individuals become vivid because of the ideas they embody when sir isaiah s talents are applied to the characters who people russian thinkers , the result is something that nobody else in britain could have emulated he has always written about issues of political thinking by writing about political thinkers most of his readers have a much clearer sense of how he reacts to particular thinkers than they have of just what doctrinal position he would adopt as his own those who suspect that he finds the english and american liberal traditions less engrossing than their cousins on the european mainland will nowhere find a plain statement to the effect that locke , jefferson and mill cannot hold a candle to benjamin constant and turgenev they will have to infer it , rightly or wrongly , from the fact that sir isaiah cheerfully acknowledges that the political arrangements proposed by locke or mill will make the world safe , orderly and prosperous all highly desirable things but appears to be much more passionately engaged with tempestuous russians and romantic germans
louisville , ky , may 1 unbridled s song added a startling chapter to his kentucky derby saga today when he was fitted with yet another pair of horseshoes to protect his scraped heel and sped half a mile in 46 seconds in the day s fastest workout at churchill downs but before the day was ended , one more tribulation was tossed into the colt s path he drew the no 20 post position on the extreme outside , a remote gate that has provided only one winner in derby history because it requires the unlucky horse to spend so much energy trying to find good early position yet , even with his sensational run of misfortune , unbridled s song was still installed as the favorite at odds of 85 his owner , ernie paragallo , the pinhooker from brooklyn who forfeited 14 million to keep the colt after a botched sale , greeted his star s revival with all of his old bravado and said everything s a go he has n't taken a bad step yet and going beyond saturday s 122d running of the derby at churchill downs , paragallo conceded that he had said recently that his horse would sweep the triple crown and might never lose again , and added , i have n't changed my mind paragallo , who was not present tuesday when the rest of his camp began switching the horse s shoes in a kind of panic , flew into louisville and presided over a remarkable change of mood and apparently of hope he said that he would cheerfully pay the 15 , 000 fee to enter unbridled s song in the derby at 5 o'clock this afternoon and would pay the extra 15 , 000 to run him 72 hours later he thereby cast an almost festive air over the ceremony of the draw , which was on national television tonight in a sports theater , with a full field of 20 horses entered in america s most treasured horse race the draw proved a disaster for many of the top contenders , including unbridled s song , and for most of the speed horses starting next to him in gate 19 will be matty g , who was expected to set the pace two stalls to his left , in no 17 , comes the 72 second choice in the race , skip away , who won the blue grass stakes in record time do we feel snakebit \? asked jim ryerson , who trains unbridled s song we won the breeders' cup juvenile and the florida derby , so we ca n't feel too snakebit but it s not going to make it any easier he 'll have to use speed to get position but the biggest news had long since been made by a blacksmith , hans albrecht , and a horse , unbridled s song , the 3yearold son of unbridled , winner of the 1990 derby the blacksmith became a central player when unbridled s song began changing shoes after arriving at churchill downs with a scraped left front heel , an injury he sustained while winning the wood memorial at aqueduct two and a half weeks ago the changes were dictated by the need to protect the colt s tender heel from the impact of running at first , a bar shoe with a metal bar across the opening was used , but only for exercise but the trainer , jim ryerson , found that the bar itself was causing some discomfort , so he switched on monday afternoon to a zbar shoe , which zigzags across the open end unbridled s song walked and jogged around the track once tuesday morning , but ryerson canceled his final derby workout scheduled for wednesday morning but on tuesday afternoon , the trainer decided that the zbar shoe was irritating the tender area , too , and switched to another style an eggbar shoe , a shoe with an oval shape but with a small rim \( or egg \) along the sides to elevate it slightly from the tender spot on the heel the blacksmith even suggested putting a bar shoe on the horse s right front foot , as well , to even things up we elected to put them on and try them , ryerson said after 24 hours of working on this horse , we felt if the track was good this morning that we would take a shot and breeze him enter the jockey , mike smith , who flew into louisville late in the day he got a call be at barn 33 by 6 the morning for an early workout he was there and , 24 hours after the cautious jog around the track , unbridled s song was dazzling in a drizzle , he shot a quarter of a mile in 23 seconds flat and half a mile in 46 flat , then galloped out fiveeighths of a mile in 591 5 seconds forty horses worked half a mile at churchill downs this morning , and none ran faster he told me not to baby him , smith said later do n't go out there in 51 we were n't going to find out anything that way let him do what he wants to do do n't go crazy , either just test him he passed with flying colors he did n't favor it at all he acted like he wanted to go around and do it again i had a hard time pulling him up everyone was a little concerned there certainly still is a problem there , but they have gotten it taken care of
lodi a lodi high school math teacher resigned yesterday after he was arrested for abusing his position by photographing the nude torsos of male students , the authorities said thomas rizer , 55 , gave the students clothing and other gifts to pose for the photos , which date back as far as 1983 , said charles r buckley , the acting prosecutor for bergen county more than 100 photographs were seized from mr rizer s home , the prosecutor said although none of the students were shown in explicit poses , mr buckley said the teacher used the photos for sexual gratification
london go back to the 1880 s , at waddesdon manor , one of more than 45 mansions once owned by the legendary rothschild banking family a typical day , the story goes , began with a servant entering a guest s bedroom would the guest like tea , coffee or cocoa \? if tea , what kind \? with milk , cream or lemon \? milk \? would that be jersey , hereford or shorthorn \? by all accounts , a guest s reception at a rothschild home is still elegant today but a certain time in history has passed , and with it the perfect projection of power and generosity found at the dynasty s zenith , when those gently wakened at the 222room waddesdon manor included prime ministers of britain and a shah of persia the manor , indeed , is no longer a rothschild home it went to the national trust in 1955 the great question now is what is to become of the house of rothschild itself for while any family , business or industry can have a bad year , the rothschilds , financiers of kings and princes when europe was a royal family affair , have had a bad century the fortune has shrunk as world wars battered the rothschilds' banks revolution in czarist russia killed their best client , and french socialists nationalized their paris bank some of the brightest sons went their own way to earn renown as scientists , poets and wine makers family feuds sent off others who , as competitors , outdid those who stayed in the fold in terms of wealth and reputation a 253yearold banking dynasty whose greatest modern successes have been wines \( chateau lafite , chateau mouton \) and vacation resorts \( club mediterranee \) , the rothschilds are now drawing together to show that today s global banks have not eclipsed their family , as nations have done away with kingdoms to succeed is more than a matter of banking strategy just as important , the english and french branches of the family must be reunited by welcoming the head of the french bank , baron david de rothschild , as the next head of the much larger and more prestigious london bank , n m rothschild sons only a few years ago , that was unthinkable in a rare interview here on friday , david and the man who invited him to cross the channel , sir evelyn rothschild , the head of n m rothschild , said that the london and paris banks had become partners again , in a way not seen since the first generations of rothschilds invented international banking uniting the family to join london s financial expertise with paris s continental contacts , sir evelyn said , is crucial if the rothschilds are to adapt to changing financial markets and intense competition from multinational banks the first important strength of the family is unity , he said the point i am trying to make is that today we 're one as you sit here and you talk to me , you are talking to david , and if you talk to david you are talking to me to that , sir evelyn s french cousin added , never has the collaboration between the french and british rothschilds been so good , except possibly in the very beginning what changed \? among the branches , london has suffered least from the force of history , but it has felt the effects of the thinning of the rothschilds' banking blood during sir evelyn s tenure at n m rothschild , several stellar bankers have left to become successes elsewhere , including the talented jacob , who is now lord rothschild , a potential successor whom evelyn saw as a rival n m rothschild was also the unhappy home of jacob s half brother , amschel , who was compelled by his father to carry on the business , despite having no enthusiasm for it and little skill in july , apparently overwhelmed by the death of his mother , he ended a business meeting in paris , went to his hotel room and hanged himself he was 41 amschel had long ago ceased to be seen as a possible successor to evelyn , but his death put a focus on the future of the dynasty there was the choice seen as inevitable by those in the banking world ceding the house of rothschild to a manager from outside , as other european family banks like schroders have done and there was david , consummately charming and highly competent , but from the wrong branch of the family evelyn , though , had brought david into n m rothschild four years earlier as deputy chairman and this month he appointed his cousin , whom he is said not only to admire , but to like , as chairman of a global committee to coordinate rothschild investment banking around the world after a century of enormous individualism and tooevident mediocrity , yet continued flashes of brilliance , the rothschilds appear ready to carry on in a way that much younger banking families like the barings and morgans have not the beginnings european outposts profit from turmoil what is the house of rothschild \? in the united states , it is little known beyond the aura of its name in europe , it has shaped nations and industries mayer amschel rothschild , a coin dealer in the jewish ghetto of frankfurt who was born in 1744 , founded both the banking business with the rothschild name and the family traditions that would make it europe s leading bank in the 19th century he decreed that only males could inherit stakes in the bank , and he impressed on his sons the importance of working loyally together as family
gov george e pataki removed district attorney robert t johnson of the bronx from the murder case against an exconvict accused of killing a police officer yesterday because , mr pataki said , he was convinced that the prosecutor would never seek the death penalty mr pataki , acknowledging that his action was an extraordinary use of executive power , replaced mr johnson with attorney general dennis c vacco , who will have 120 days to decide whether to seek capital punishment once the men accused of killing officer kevin gillespie last week have been arraigned mr johnson said he would fight the governor in court to remain on the case but he added that for now , and at least until the man accused of shooting officer gillespie is indicted , he would work with the attorney general because the prosecution must not suffer , no matter who the prosecutor may be in a news conference in his manhattan office , the governor acknowledged that his decision was unprecedented governors have previously used their authority to replace local prosecutors only to punish corruption or incompetence or when requested to do so mr johnson said that he had not categorically ruled out the death penalty in this case , despite his grave reservations about capital punishment but mr pataki said he believed that mr johnson s principles would ultimately prevent him from objectively considering the death penalty as punishment this is not a decision i made lightly , said mr pataki , who was flanked by officer gillespie s brother , patrick bahnken his partner , officer gary lemite , and lou matarazzo , the president of the patrolmen s benevolent association it is not a decision that i make not aware of the fact that it is an extraordinary decision , but the murder of a police officer is an extraordinary act it threatens the rule of law it threatens the lives of all of us it is now subject to the death penalty he said they were concerned that the death penalty law would be put into legal peril if it were enforced in different ways around the state and his aides said they moved quickly to replace mr johnson because they would have no authority to challenge a local prosecutor s decision once a judgment had been made article , page b2 we cannot have different standards and different laws in different parts of this state , mr pataki continued we cannot have the death penalty in new york state except the bronx i respect the principles of mr johnson , but i cannot allow that principle to stand in the way of the enforcement of the law but mr johnson complained that his reservations about capital punishment have been misinterpreted and that he had been removed before he had exercised his right to consider the appropriate penaltyhe said he had been unfairly singled out among district attorneys in new york city , none of whom have sought the death penalty since the statute took effect in september the governor has tried to bootstrap his argument by mischaracterizing my statements continually , said mr johnson during his own news conference yesterday i have never said i'm an opponent of the death penalty i have never said never i have said what my beliefs are in my own way he chose to say it was a philosophical and moral opposition i never said that , and i never said i would not impose the death penalty mr pataki s action plunges him into a thicket of untested laws and murky legal theories for while it is clear that a governor has the broad , unspecified authority to shunt aside a local prosecutor in a particular case , state courts have not addressed the question of whether the executive powers can be invoked simply because the governor disagrees with a prosecutor s legal judgment the death penalty statute itself complicates the question , because it specifically gives local prosecutors the right to decide which penalty to seek in certain egregious murder cases death or life without parole and so , within a week s time , a bronx police officer s shooting death resulted in an unprecedented feud over politics , principles and the law between mr johnson , a democrat who was overwhelmingly elected after publicly declaring his opposition to the death penalty , and mr pataki , a republican who narrowly won the governorship on a procapital punishment platform dueling with faxes and press conferences , the two men even carried their battle to the today show yesterday , where they fielded questions from a host , matt lauer as the day progressed , the city s police officers , lawyers , advocates and politicians lined up on either side applauding governor pataki were mayor rudolph w giuliani , borough president guy molinari of staten island and the patrolmen s benevolent association supporting mr johnson were the new york civil liberties union , borough president ruth messinger of manhattan , the naacp and the urban league and beneath all the heated speeches lay the law , which is murky while district attorneys have sued governors to remain on cases , it is still an open question as to whether the courts have the right to review a governor s decision
german prosecutors gave details yesterday of the charges against jose ignacio lopez de arriortua , the former general motors executive who left for volkswagen ag and who was indicted this week at a news conference in darmstadt , germany , and in a statement , the prosecutors said they believed they had sufficient evidence to prove that mr lopez committed these acts drew on plans developed by general motors for an advanced assembly plant , known as plant x including confidential information relating to gm s factories in saragossa , spain , and eisenach , germany to prepare plans for a similar volkswagen factory with the designation plant b \( neither the gm plant nor the vw factory was ever built \) developed presentations for volkswagen on the future of the automobile industry that relied heavily on similar documents taken from general motors prepared volkswagen presentations of an advanced purchasing strategy known by the german initials kvp2 that were largely based on similar materials outlining gm s purchasing concept used general motors material regarding the goals of components purchasing for the development of similar documents for volkswagen the prosecutors said they had evidence that mr lopez , who left volkswagen last month , had met with vw s chief executive , ferdinand piech , on nov 29 , 1992 , while he was still a gm employee but prosecutors said they had no evidence that mr lopez , who joined vw three months later , had informed mr piech or other vw executives of the plans he was considering mr lopez was indicted on charges of embezzlement and betraying to volkswagen confidential documents obtained while still a gm employee three associates of mr lopez were also indicted jorge alvarez , who was recently appointed purchasing director at vw s spanish unit , seat jose manuel gutierrez , and rosario piazza the prosecutors' charges essentially match many of the accusations made by general motors three years ago , but they stop short of supporting gm s contention that mr lopez and his associates acted with the backing of vw when they engaged in industrial espionage gerhard andres , the chief prosecutor , said the investigation had yielded no sufficient evidence of any vw collaboration in their statement , the prosecutors said that mr lopez and his associates began putting their plan into effect some time after the 1992 meeting with mr piech and that the four former gm executives hauled off a trove of documents from gm s divisions for research , planning , assembly and purchasing , in order to evaluate them for their work at vw and , at least in part , to destroy them countering another gm assertion , mr andres said the investigators found that general motors had suffered no measurable property damage because of the activities of mr lopez the prosecutors said the documents that mr lopez took to vw included plans for the construction of the plant x advanced factory in spain purchasing data for european assembly operations various lists with cost data regarding the opel models corsa , omega , astra and vectra savings estimates and purchasing strategies for the year 1993 , and plans for a new gm subcompact called the ocar the chief investigator in the case , thomas seifert , who also attended the news conference , stressed that no evidence had emerged showing that any of mr lopez s documents were ever given away , for instance , to vw s management offices or to individual members of management lawyers for mr lopez in frankfurt said in a statement that the charges were based on circumstantial evidence and partly on testimony by witnesses who had since recanted they did not elaborate they said many of the documents cited by the prosecution were not confidential but were available to a broad public while many of the charges outlined today were known previously through news reports , it was the first time they were formally embraced by the prosecutors even so , the wealth of detail appeared unlikely to budge the two corporate adversaries in their longrunning struggle indeed , gm , which has rebuffed volkswagen in its attempts to reach a settlement , said in a statement yesterday that the indictment showed that attempts by vw to characterize the affair as a private matter of mr lopez are misleading the statement , released by its adam opel subsidiary in russelsheim , germany , said the indictment confirmed the initial suspicion of industrial espionage volkswagen said it had no comment , but cited news reports to the effect that the prosecutors had denied any involvement by vw management volkswagen , based in wolfsburg , germany , apparently hoped that such a finding might clear the way to a revival of communications with gm about a possible settlement vw is especially keen on reaching an outofcourt agreement as a possible step to avoid the prospect of a civil court trial in detroit , where general motors has accused vw of racketeering , copyright infringement and industrial espionage walther leisler kiep , a member of the vw supervisory board , said that if the prosecutors failed to include any other present or former member of the vw management , including mr piech , in the indictment , then they must have a basis for that asked by phone whether vw hoped to get back in touch with gm about a settlement , mr kiep , a leading figure in the settlement attempt , replied , yes , most definitely but a member of opel s management board , horst borghs , told reuters , there are no current talks , and none are planned
as a result of new rulings in new york state courts , investors who think they have been robbed by their brokers now appear free to seek punitive damages in arbitration , something the industry has bitterly fought now that arbitrators are empowered to award punitive damages , you run a substantial risk of having punitive damages awarded in many cases , said marshall h fishman , a partner in rosenman colin , a new york law firm that frequently represents brokerage houses in arbitration cases the victory for investors on punitive damages appeared to be near last year , when the united states supreme court allowed punitive damages in one new york case but new york courts found ways to distinguish other cases from that case , and jane solomon of the state supreme court , who hears many such cases , repeatedly dismissed requests for punitive damages before the cases could go to arbitration last week , though , in a case involving an investor who says he lost 1 million because merrill lynch brokers put him in inappropriate and risky investments , justice solomon reversed her position , concluding that punitive damages could now be awarded in any case in which the investor had not specifically agreed in advance not to seek such damages while that ruling would appear to leave open the possibility that brokerage firms could ask investors to rule out punitive damages when they open accounts , securities lawyers say such a move would violate rules of the new york stock exchange and the national association of securities dealers , which bar limitations on arbitrators' authority arbitration of complaints has been mandatory in the securities industry since 1987 , when the supreme court upheld brokerage agreements requiring arbitration and barring the right to sue while a brokerage firm could give its customers the choice of suing or going to arbitration , none do so one attraction of arbitration to the brokerage industry was that state court decisions in new york had said that arbitrators could not award punitive damages such damages are intended to punish the transgressor and are in addition to compensatory damages , which are supposed to right the wrong while new york is only one of 50 states , it gets far more than one of 50 arbitration requests , because major brokerage firms are based in the state and because some firms specify that arbitrations will be governed by new york law some brokerage firms had routinely replied to arbitration requests that sought punitive damages by going to court to get a ruling barring such damages , and others had successfully appealed punitive damage awards in new york courts so while some punitive damage awards had been made , many others had been blocked that changed after a decision issued on oct 8 by the first division of the appellate division of the state supreme court , which covers manhattan and the bronx that ruling allowed a dismissed employee of donaldson , lufkin jenrette , which is 80 percent owned by equitable , to seek punitive damages from the firm in an arbitration the employee , joseph m mulder , said he had been discharged after uncovering a moneylaundering scheme justice solomon cited that decision last week in ruling , in the merrill lynch case , that punitive damages could now be sought by investors in new york arbitrations the decision involved a belgian investor named leon driessens , who was represented by theodore c eppenstein , a new york lawyer that case will now go to arbitration merrill said yesterday that it would not appeal justice solomon s decision for investors subject to new york law , the new rulings make it more likely that arbitrations seeking punitive damages will be heard more quickly , since brokerage firms are less likely to run to court before the arbitration , as merrill did in the driessens case arbitration awards rarely include punitive damages , even in areas where the legality of such awards has been clear but the brokerage industry , nevertheless , has feared their growth the nasd is expected next month to propose a limitation on the size of punitive damages that limit is expected to be close to one suggested last year by a committee headed by a former chairman of the securities and exchange commission twice compensatory damages , or 750 , 000 , whichever is greater
orlando , fla , dec 31 anyone who saw the young man s father play , even once , will never forget it archie manning had that kind of effect he had courage , panache , dash and he was the best quarterback in college football he would walk up behind the center with that peculiar , halfbowlegged gait , take the snap , drop back , look like he was about to be engulfed by the pass rush , sprint outside , throw hissing spirals on the dead run that was the late 60 s , when he had the stars and bars on the side of his ole miss helmet and the cheers of oxford , mississippi s adoring fans ringing in his ears later , when he got to the pros , behind lines that could n't block , those images of archie mutated into a haunted and hunted man ducking and sidestepping and trying just to get a pass off before getting decked it is these kind of recollections that make it all the more eerie to look at the 19yearold quarterback on the practice field outside the florida citrus bowl as he prepares to meet ohio state in the compusa citrus bowl game on monday afternoon , the university of tennessee quarterback is awakening all sorts of distant echoes there is the voice , pure southern there is the face , the teeth , the nose , all unmistakably manning there is the manner , all yes , sir , and no , sir and there is the arm it hangs loosely , almost casually , with long , thick fingers attached to the large hand that dangles from a ropy forearm and bicep you have seen this arm before , just as you have seen the face and the eyes peyton manning , archie s son it is as though the old man had been made just a few inches taller \( peyton stands 6 feet 5 1 2 inches \) and given a slightly stronger arm , a hairquicker release peyton manning , in the same conference that his dad once dominated , is the reincarnation of archie manning except for one thing the child may go farther than the man already , manning might be the best quarterback in college football and , as frank broyles , the old arkansas athletic director might have put it , heee s only a sophomowa , keith he was named the top quarterback in the southeastern conference by the sec coaches , despite numbers that were not as glitzy as florida s danny wuerffel there are pro scouts who have told peyton s daddy that the young man would , right now , be the first quarterback chosen if he were to decide to enter the national football league draft i do n't know anything about that , peyton said , flashing an easy smile that says he is n't kidding i do n't have any control over what other people say i'm just a sophomore who s trying to get better this is not lip service many players have said the same thing one day and jumped to the nfl the next , but those who know him best say that leaving tennessee is not even remotely on peyton s mind i can honestly say that we 've never spoken about it , said his father , who speaks with his son daily peyton is kind of a historian about college football , and i know he had a lot of dreams as a kid about what he might accomplish as a college player i think all his goals are centered around college right now the young manning s goals might have been set back when he was 6 , listening to taped reruns of radio broadcasts of his father s games at ole miss \( he can still name the starting lineup from the '69 team \) or maybe when he and his older brother used to toss waddedup tape around the new orleans saints' locker room after their dad s pro games , pretending it was a football the important thing is that they were his goals to set dad never really pushed us into football , peyton said he never really let us play it on the playground he never worked with me , like oneonone passing drills , until i was a freshman in high school it was always a situation where i had to come to him , ask him if he wanted to go work out he never pushed me into anything peyton pushed himself his accomplishments thus far have to have exceeded his goals , which he keeps to himself the numbers alone are telling thrown into the fray as a true freshman last year when tennessee lost its first two quarterbacks to injury , he was 71 as a starter this season he led tennessee to a 101 record and broke school passing records for attempts \( 380 \) , completions \( 244 \) , completion percentage \( 642 \) and yardage \( 2 , 954 \) all that , and he beat alabama , too , the first quarterback to lead the vols to a victory over the hated crimson tide in 10 years but as impressive as his achievements are , his overall persona is just as remarkable this player , it seems , is just too good to be true before he had even taken a snap as a freshman , manning already had dissected hours of tennessee game film he had worked out on his own , five days a week it was no surprise , then , when manning quickly moved ahead of brandon stewart , another freshman whom many believed was the superior athlete , simply by outworking him stewart transferred to texas am , where he probably will start next year , and manning is now well on his way to breaking every tennessee passing record
little rock , ark , may 29 when they finally began their deliberations on may 16 , after absorbing three months of tortuous testimony and hundreds of documents about an interlocking chain of complicated financial deals , some of the jurors in the criminal trial of the whitewater partners james b and susan mcdougal discussed the testimony of president clinton for a few brief moments it was the only time they talked about mr clinton s two and a half hours of videotaped deposition , and most of the jurors who have decided to speak publicly felt that the president s words were credible and that he raised questions about the truthfulness of the government s main witness , david hale but the jurors also saw mr clinton s testimony as peripheral and hardly bothered to consider it further some jurors discounted mr hale entirely while others believed in significant portions of his testimony , but all agreed that they would not rely on any one witness when it came to deciding the fate of the mcdougals and gov jim guy tucker of arkansas instead , the jurors said , they relied on their unusually large volume of notes about the 700 exhibits and the testimony of witnesses other than mr hale and the president the jurors said whitewater prosecutors had presented so much evidence aside from mr hale s testimony that they had no choice but to convict the defendants on virtually all of the charges and one of the jurors said that if mr mcdougal had sat silently rather than insisting on taking the stand , against the advice of defense lawyers , there would have been more acquittals and far fewer convictions i would have shot jim mcdougal if i had been one of the other defendants , said the juror , colin c capp a threehour interview with mr capp , a 51yearold car salesman from little rock and the son of al capp , the cartoonist who created l'il abner , and accounts provided by five other jurors showed that the nine women and three men who sat in judgment were an unusually tightly knit group , even though they were never sequestered each morning they began their deliberation with a prayer for divine inspiration , and most afternoons , they ended with a prayer of thanks that they had survived another intense day they cast themselves in the roles of the defendants and other witnesses , acting out the scenes that were described in the 21count indictment to test whether they were believable they also took turns at an easel in the tiny jury room , drawing diagrams to illustrate their theories about the participation of the defendants and witnesses in the dealings that prosecutors say sank madison guaranty savings and loan association , the financial institution that the mcdougals ran and hillary rodham clinton briefly represented as a lawyer before regulators appointed by her husband , then governor of arkansas to pass the hours of seeming interminable delay during the trial , the jurors played spades and through most of the trial , they set up a kitty , each kicking in 2 a week , for ice for their soft drinks and candy to help them keep awake during the hours of dull testimony but for all the nation s interest in the trial , which was the result of mr clinton s participation in the case , the jurors said they paid almost no attention to the president because he had provided virtually no illumination on the underlying charges of fraud and conspiracy against the mcdougals and governor tucker mr capp called the president s testimony magnificent he said that he and other jurors had come to believe that david hale perjured himself when he testified mr hale , the government s main witness , had told the jurors that he was asked by mr clinton to issue a 300 , 000 federally backed loan during the trial , an agent of the federal bureau of investigation testified that nearly 50 , 000 of that money went to pay for whitewater expenses mr clinton , called to the stand by the defense in an attempt to undermine mr hale s credibility , said in videotaped testimony that he never discussed any business with mr hale , who on friday is scheduled to begin serving a 28month sentence for two felonies to which he has pleaded guilty but the jury foreman , sandra wood , said the president s testimony cast little light on the issues in the trial , although she added that she and other jurors had come to believe mr clinton when he said he had no knowledge of the series of loans that the jurors ultimately found to be fraudulent and the jurors said they did not intend by their verdict to send any kind of political message our verdict was absolutely not meant to be any kind of statement on the president , and it is demeaning to us to think that it was at all politically motivated , said tracy h pleasants , a 30yearold hospital worker from conway of the defendants , she said we fought really hard for their liberty we were defeated by the evidence in fact , mr capp was downright critical of the prosecution he said that he believed that the whitewater independent counsel , kenneth w starr , had been motivated by politics and that he had been offended that mr starr appeared to be too busy with his private practice to ever bother to show up at the trial
at least 35 people in the new york city area have been stricken since early may by an exotic parasitic intestinal infection whose source is unknown , health officials said yesterday new york city health department officials said they were alerting doctors and laboratories to look for the parasite , cyclospora cayetanensis , among patients with unexplained intestinal symptoms there have been no deaths , and doctors say the illness is generally not fatal the infection can cause cramping , abdominal pain , severe diarrhea , nausea , a mild fever up to 102 degrees fahrenheit and extreme fatigue the illness often subsides for a few days , then recurs the course of illness can usually be shortened with a combination antibiotic , trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole , which is sold as septra or bactrim but if cyclospora is untreated , doctors say it can cause weeks of debilitating fatigue and loss of appetite , leading to a loss of 15 to 20 pounds epidemiologists say they are puzzled by the source of the disease , which was first reported in nepal in 1989 dr james miller and dr marcel layton , two health department officials , said there seemed to be no connection among the people in new york city who had contracted the disease in recent weeks none of the cases have had contact with another case that we can determine , and none were together at any one place , dr miller said the health officials said they were focusing on the possibility that the infections resulted from contaminated foods like vegetables or fresh fruit officials are also trying to determine how many other cases have not been reported , and they are looking into the possibility that the parasite may have entered the united states with returning tourists the health department said it is prudent to wash fruit and vegetables before they are eaten the parasite does not appear to be inside fruits with unbroken skin or surfaces because it is so rare , new york and other cities do not keep track of the number of cyclospora cases but because of the unusual number of cases this year , the health department is asking that doctors and laboratories report all such cases to it so far , 31 of the 35 cases have been reported in residents of new york city four additional cases were reported in residents of westchester county and new jersey , and diagnosed by doctors in new york city new york hospital s parasitology laboratory has confimed 31 cases , but not all were included in the health department totals yesterday because of a reporting lag that is common in unusual situations last year , 32 people became ill from cyclospora infections after an event at the old oaks country club in purchase , ny , said mary landrigan , a spokeswoman for the westchester county health department there were no deaths epidemiologists did not identify a single food item as a source of the outbreak , and suspicion focused on a contaminated water supply at the club , ms landrigan said in the latest cases from new york city , the initial wave came from new york hospitalcornell medical center , where doctors have been studying the disease for several years dr bradley a connor , a gastroenterologist at the center , said some of the patients with cyclospora he had treated had had extreme fatigue disproportionate to their symptoms some have had to go home to rest at lunch , dr connor said dr connor said it was his impression that many cases involved people in the middle to upperincome groups the impression was based in part by a call to an expert on parasitic diseases at a hospital in the bronx who had not detected any cases , dr connor said health department officials said they were not focusing their questions on socioeconomic status and that more cases might have been reported from new york hospital because of the doctors' interest in the disease cases have been reported from other areas of the city since alerts were first sent out to hospitals and laboratories last week , health officials said the health department is working with the federal centers for disease control and prevention and health officials elsewhere to determine the extent of the problem although the cyclospora parasite was first detected only a few years ago , experts presume that it has been around for a long time but is being recognized now partly because of improved laboratory techniques relatively few cyclospora cases have been reported in this country limited experience indicates that the illness follows a seasonal pattern , beginning in the spring and stopping about october
aha , we thought , when we first heard about moukratry thailao in bridgeport , maybe this is the beginning of a new trend , laotian cooking wrong thai cuisine had its 15 minutes of fame several years ago , when every time one turned around a new restaurant featuring the spicy food of that country seemed to be opening while there is overlap in the cooking from the two southeast asian neighbors the prevalence of ingredients like fresh coriander , garlic , peanuts , dried hot chilies , coconut milk , ginger , lemon grass , lime and mint there are differences as well laotian cuisine features many dishes using raw fish and meat , a variety of sauces , purees and stuffings and glutinous rice served at all meals , not just for dessert as its neighbors use it laotian food is even spicier than thai , though , in our view , lacks the thai subtlety unfortunately , we had little opportunity to sample laotian dishes at moukratry thailao , though the hostessowner is from laos the sizable menu consists of many thai specialties , with a handful of laotian dishes on the back page , written in laotian with no translation when we asked the agreeable hostess to describe several of these dishes , we quickly realized that it was as impossible a task for her in english as it would have been for us in laotian thus we turned back to the thai menu and began with several old favorites yumpla mauk , a salad of squid cut into diamond shapes , enhanced by lime , garlic , red chili peppers and scallions , with a fresh coriander garnish , was pleasingly tart and spicy meekrob , a thai standard , was a shadow of its usual crisp and crunchy self , with the sweetened noodles near limp , tossed with a few shrimp and even fewer of the other ingredients that usually give it a sweethot sparkle laab , another standby , was an acceptable salad of cooked ground beef \( pork or chicken are also available \) , lime juice , onion and chopped red chili peppers , though it would have benefited from the addition of the customary lemon grass and mint while none of the entrees were as spicy as they would be in thailand , panang was a wellseasoned dish with pieces of chicken breast and broccoli florets in a sweetspicy coconut milk broth better yet was padthai , a classic noodle dish tossed with shrimp , wisps of scrambled egg , chopped scallions and bean sprouts and topped with ground peanuts the textural contrasts , enhanced by lime , garlic and chili peppers , make this dish special disappointments were a bland mookaprow \( thin slices of pork with basil leaves , onions and chili peppers \) and plaped prig , a small deepfried whole snapper that arrived desiccated , along with a few scrapings of garlic and red chili pepper the fish was desperately in need of a sauce accompanying the meal was a little dish of nam pla , a clear , spicy fish sauce that is a thai kitchen staple , as well as a traditional silverfinished hammered metal tureen chockful of steaming white rice desserts are canned lichee and longans , usually a gentle conclusion to an incendiary meal , though most dishes here are only tentatively spiced moukratry thailao s major asset is price most dinner entrees \( except the whole fish dishes at 1295 \) are priced from 6 to 795 , and each serving is generous four starters and four entrees \( plus enough rice for eight people \) cost four of us a total of 4785 , before tax and tip there is no liquor license , but guests are free to supply their own beer or wine soda , hot tea or sweetened ice tea and coffee are available moukratry thailao satisfactory 472 huntington turnpike , bridgeport 3748508 atmosphere plain storefront in a small shopping complex , with orchid and light green walls , a maroon carpet and taped thai background music service friendly and polite , but with limited english skills recommended dishes yumpla mauk , laab , padthai , panang price range lunch 550 , dinner 6 1295 credit cards american express , mastercard , visa hours lunch 10 am4 30 pm wednesday through monday , dinner 4 3010 30 pm wednesday through sunday closed tuesday reservations accepted wheelchair accessibility street level entry , restrooms at dining room level
they are an unusual club , the victims of the unabomber mostly academics , a few corporate executives , and one a secretary who happened to open the wrong package , they are spread at random across the country and linked only by the fact that their lives were damaged or in some cases devastated by a package from someone with a penchant for evil most have never even met but with the news yesterday that the dark odyssey of nearly 18 years might finally be ending , their common bond came flooding back with vivid memories of that terrible moment when the bomber shook their lives there was a tremendous bang , a loud concussion like zaaaaaaaaaaaack , said john e hauser , an air force pilot who was working on a master s degree at the university of california at berkeley and dreaming of being an astronaut until may 15 , 1985 all he did was move a seemingly misplaced plastic box on a computer laboratory table the bomb permanently shredded his right arm and fingers , ripping off his air force academy ring with such force that it imprinted the words academy on the wall behind him mr hauser , now a 37yearold professor at the university of colorado , says he remembers watching the pooling blood , screaming for help and wondering why would someone do this \? it is a question those connected to the three people killed and 23 wounded by the unabomber have asked themselves countless times the question is somewhat stronger among those who were targets , rather than being wounded at random it is ultimately the question they hope will be answered now that a likely suspect has been found i never had a sense of why he targeted me , said percy a woods , 76 , who retired as president of united airlines in 1983 , three years after the bomb that wounded him arrived at his home in lake forest , ill , burrowed inside a novel i do n't think any of us ever had mr woods said he had not really formed a mental image of who the unabomber might be , finding reports of a harvard university degree and an academic career almost too wild to contemplate i felt it had to be someone demented in some respect , he just was n't an every day human being , but beyond that i had no idea , said mr woods , who spent several weeks in a hospital and underwent plastic surgery to regain the use of his hand he said the federal bureau of investigation once considered trying to bring all the victims together to see if there was a common strand among them , but eventually abandoned the project because everyone was so different none of those contacted yesterday recognized the name of the suspect but they began speculating where they might have crossed paths with him or how he might have singled them out patrick fischer , head of the computer science department at vanderbilt university in nashville , was on vacation when the package arrived for him his secretary , janet smith , opened a wooden box with a pipe bomb , and it blew up in her face she recovered physically in weeks , but has refused to speak about the incident publicly at first i always thought it had been a random thing , mr fischer said i figured the guy said this time i want to do a computer scientist so he would go look up computer scientists in the who s who and take it from there but the manifesto published last year changed mr fischer s mind it smacked of careful plotting it also made him a little more fearful , although he took solace in the fact that the bomber had never struck the same victim twice the victims do share some common traits they doubted the bomber would be found they still fear packages or even large envelopes they were a little curious about the manifesto , but not enough to plow through the thicket of technological and sociological jargon word by word they disliked the publicity it gave him , but think it might have helped catch him and that the person named as a suspect is indeed the bomber it would be nice to hear he ca n't hurt anyone else , said diogenes angelakos , 77 , a professor emeritus of electrical engineering at the university of california at berkeley he picked up a pipe bomb in the faculty lounge that exploded , injuring his right hand he had also been the second man to reach mr hauser the day he was gravely injured mr angelakos thinks the violence might have been fertilized by the radical politics prevalent at berkeley when the suspect taught there in the late 1960 s those were unsettled years , he said maybe he went preaching around and could n't get any attention , so he went bombing the earlier victims have tried to forget about the whole thing , letting time flow over most of their concerns but for those closest to the more recent victims , the news touched wounds still raw staff members at the california forestry association in sacramento heard about the potential arrest of a suspect after a morning meeting discussing how they might commemorate the first anniversary of the death of their president , gilbert murray , killed when he opened a package in the group s headquarters on april 24 , 1995 our initial reaction is one of nervous optimism , said donn e zea , vice president of the lobbying organization in a way it was like digging back a year ago and reigniting all the emotions of trauma , shock and horror he said staff members had talked to mr murray s wife , connie , and the couple s sons one in high school and one a freshman in college but they did not want to speak publicly i think the family is feeling the same anxiety that we have , mr zea said we have been down this road before , there have been a number of different suspects , but this seems more positive mr zea said the arrest reminded everyone what the office had looked like a year ago , right after the bomb went off he said he had been talking on the phone to mr murray about the oklahoma city bombing and and had just hung up when the explosion pushed the nail heads out of the walls in his own office the office where the bomb went off itself looked like a scene that i have only experienced on international news from beirut or tel aviv or somewhere , a war atmosphere with shrapnel in the walls and everything busted down there was a chemical smell from the bomb itself the carpeting and all the walls had been ripped out there was a real sense of evil to it , it was disturbing to walk through , you just felt like your privacy had been violated he said mr murray was a 47yearold graduate of the university of california at berkeley who had been there at almost the same time the suspect was mr zea also said coworkers had been struck by the fact that mr murray had survived two tours in vietnam only to die savagely in a relatively quiet california city the families and friends left behind after other bombs went off have tended to withdraw from public view in north caldwell , nj , neighbors said family members had kept largely to themselves since a package exploded in their kitchen on dec 10 , 1994 , killing thomas mosser , a 50yearold advertising executive i ca n't talk to you , it is too soon , his wife said at the kitchen door , where she was watching the evening news with a teenage son photos gilbert murray , left , was killed in sacramento , calif , inapril 1995 thomas mosser was killed in north caldwell , nj , in december 1994
more than 200 graduate teaching assistants at yale university have withheld grades from fall semester courses to pressure the university into recognizing their union , the union said yesterday yale officials said it would take several days to assess the extent of the grade strike and its effect on undergraduates yale officials , who warned graduate students in december that taking part in a grade strike could affect their evaluations or their teaching appointments for the spring semester , said that three teaching assistants so far have been told to appear at disciplinary hearings with yale students expecting their grades when they return to campus in new haven on jan 15 , a yale spokesman , thomas conroy , said that neither the grade strike nor any other action by graduate students would in any way change the university s position that they are students , not employees yesterday was the deadline for submitting grades to the registrar the graduate students have mobilized a campaign in which professors across the country have protested to yale s president , richard c levin , that teaching assistants should not be threatened for their organizing efforts last week , at the annual meeting of the modern language association of america , the nation s largest conference of academics , delegates voted to censure yale for failing to respect the right of graduate students to take part in union activities without fear of reprisals against their academic careers the graduate student union , the graduate employees and students organization , or geso , contends that yale relies so heavily on graduate students to teach undergraduate classes and discussion sections that the doctoral candidates have become part of the university s work force some 400 graduate students in humanities and socialscience departments teach undergraduates in yale college , in return for stipends that in most cases pay 4 , 970 a semester in addition , the great majority do not pay tuition the union maintains that the stipends are inadequate and that the time required to lead expanded class sections because of budget cuts harms both the graduate students' teaching and their research but through the union s five years of efforts to win recognition , including a brief teaching strike in 1991 , yale has insisted that the graduate students are students who accept teaching responsibilities as part of their apprenticeship while teaching assistants are represented by faculty unions at 11 public universities , including rutgers university and the university of wisconsin , none are unionized at private universities like yale in a letter to undergraduates at yale college in december , dean richard h brodhead pledged that their fallsemester work would be evaluated and graded by ordinary means and on the ordinary timetable , we trust but by extraordinary means and on an extraordinary timetable if that proves unavoidable for some professors who teach large lecture courses in which several teaching assistants lead discussion sections , the grade strike poses the problem of evaluating hundreds of students without midterm grades , papers or knowledge of their class participation some undergraduates , as well as the union , have questioned the integrity of grades awarded under those circumstances grade sheets are going to be turned in by some faculty members , but there is some question about how those grades are derived , said deborah chernoff , a spokesman for the federation of university employees , whose two locals of staff employees support the graduate students the graduate students , however , have alienated many undergraduates who see the teaching assistants as students like themselves who are threatening their education if geso does n't back down , the yale daily news editorialized last month , it s time for some bitter medicine perhaps it s time for yale to stop tolerating geso with polite disdain and finally eliminated the selfstyled teaching assistants' union
white plains , nov 14 taking advantage of this city s glut of office space , nine west group inc is consolidating its cincinnati and stamford , conn , operations and moving its headquarters here the move will bring 1 , 250 jobs to new york state , gov george e pataki said at a news conference here the company , a leader in women s shoes , started at 9 west 57th street in manhattan and grew over the years into a publicly traded company with 13 billion in annual revenues we 've seen swiss re come to westchester , mr pataki said we 've seen ibm stay in westchester we 've seen oxford health bring in 1 , 000 jobs to westchester but we 're just extremely pleased that a company that was started in new york by new yorkers will be coming back and growing and succeeding right here in westchester county the 1 , 250 jobs cited by mr pataki are actually nine west s projection for 1998 next year , the company expects to bring close to 1 , 000 jobs to westchester , about 200 of which will come from cincinnati , said noel hord , nine west s president none are manufacturing jobs , he said nine west doubled in size last year when it acquired us shoe s footwear group us shoe was based in cincinnati , and nine west in stamford the consolidated company is to occupy a glasssheathed building on westchester avenue , which is to be vacated by nynex nine west has signed a 25year lease the company expects to begin refurbishing the 377 , 000squarefoot building in march and to start moving in employees in july both connecticut and new york courted nine west to woo the company , the empire state development corporation offered it more than 16 million in grants also , the state will waive 12 million in sales taxes that nine west would otherwise pay for goods and services it buys governor pataki said , we are winning these fights , not all of them , but we are winning more than our fair share because we 're in there competing and working hard every day to match incentives , lower taxes and lower worker s comp rates but regional economic experts and mr hord said that what ultimately sold nine west on new york was the availability of the nynex building , which would allow the company to save money by not having to construct a new building in fairfield county both states in the last several months worked very aggressively to keep us in connecticut and to attract us to new york , mr hord said it came down to the difference between constructing a new building and signing a longterm lease michael siegel , executive director of the edward s gordon company , a real estate brokerage concern with offices in new york and connecticut , said nine west wanted to relocate to a space in excess of 300 , 000 square feet there s is a scarcity of space of that size in lower fairfield county about 24 percent of the office space in in westchester county is vacant , according to the rostenbergdoren company , a corporate real estate company

about 30 people were injured in harlem last night when gunshots set off a panic in a large crowd that spilled far past the bounds of a plaza where some of the biggest names in popular music were performing free no one was hit by gunfire and none of the injured were seriously hurt , though 22 were taken to hospitals for treatment , according to the police and the emergency medical service the police arrested a 20yearold man , coneway r christie of mount vernon , who they said was on parole from a prison sentence for a prior shooting incident the police said about 15 , 000 people turned out for the concert to promote voter registration , which featured groups like the fugees , pharcyde and the wutang clan , though the organizers' permit estimated that just 5 , 000 people would turn out even the lower figure , city officials said , would have been too many for the plaza in front of the adam clayton powell jr state office building at 125th street and adam clayton powell jr boulevard and mayor rudolph w giuliani said at a news conference that the organizers of the event , a group called the refugee project that is affiliated with the fugees , thwarted efforts by the police to end the concert and turn off the music when the event first began to get out of hand , more than an hour before the gunfire even before the shots were fired at about 7 50 pm , officials said , there had been several smaller disturbances , and the emergency medical service had treated about 30 people for minor injuries the crowd spilled well past the edges of the plaza , forcing the police to close 125th street to traffic the mayor said that at 6 30 pm , someone set off firecrackers , causing a commotion in the crowd at that point , he said , the police tried to end the event when the police department turned off the power , the group used a backup generator to continue the music , he said concert organizers could not be located for comment last night at the concert site , or at the address given by the mayor for the refugee project , at 208 east 51st street in manhattan mr giuliani said one of the people listed as an organizer of the event was sister souljah , the rapper whom bill clinton , then a candidate for president , criticized in 1992 for reportedly making derogatory comments about white people the concert was one in a series of events organized in part by black political leaders to increase black voter registration in the city one of their primary aims is to unseat mr giuliani in 1997 cristyne lategano , a spokeswoman for the mayor , said that the organizers had posted a 3 million bond with the state as security for the event , and that the city would try to win reimbursement from that bond for the cost of policing and cleaning up after the event more than 200 officers were called out for crowd control police commissioner howard safir said last night s incident was a case of too many people in an area designed for many fewer mr giuliani said the capacity of the plaza was about 2 , 000 to 3 , 000 people but he was careful not to blame the organizers for the disturbance , or to question the wisdom of inviting popular groups to hold a free concert in such a spot he also refrained from saying that the state , which he said had granted the organizers a permit to use the site , should not have done so he said the group did not need a city permit i ca n't say the city would not have given the permit , he said police officers and concertgoers said that at about 7 50 pm , a man standing on 125th street drew a 38caliber handgun , pointed it in the air , put a finger in his ear and fired three shots , touching off the panic it was like a stampede , said michelle gray of brooklyn people just started running she said several people fell and were stepped on , including an elderly woman and a small child clyde enniss said that in the confusion , a man threw an empty malt liquor bottle , which shattered , and then everybody started pushing each other but capt jack mcgonnigle of the ems said that although many people were pretty banged up , none appeared to have serious injuries police capt mike collins said the gunman , mr christie , was arrested moments after the shots were fired , with two bullets remaining in his gun the captain said that mr christie shot at a police officer in brooklyn in january , 1992 , and was sent to prison for that incident in july , 1993 , and paroled last december he did not know what charges mr christie , who was a juvenile at the time of that shooting , was convicted of he said mr christie s parole extended until july , 2002 captain collins said mr christie was also arrested in december , 1991 in mount vernon for criminal possession of stolen property , and in march , 1993 in new york city for assault it was unclear what became of those charges photo the crowd of 15 , 000 at the concert in harlem forced the policeto close 125th street to traffic the police maintained a

johannesburg , may 10 they had an unerring sense of the photoop whether south africa was celebrating a new constitution or a world rugby victory , f w de klerk and nelson mandela always seemed to find each other in the crowd they would walk together , clasping hands , offering the world that warm and fuzzy picture of black and white leaders at work together but behind the scenes they do n't like each other very much there have been shouting matches , and potshots exchanged in the press still , the fears that were at work when mr mandela s african national congress and mr de klerk s national party agreed to govern together for five years have faded more rapidly than anyone expected while the country still faces enormous problems , most whites do not seem so anxious to flee afrikaner military and police officers who served the apartheid government are doing their jobs like professionals , not plotting coups businesses are trying to make affirmative action work and to find a way to serve big pieces of the economic pie to black shareholders and blacks have not sought revenge the world may have been taken in by the pictures but south africans knew the political marriage of mr mandela and mr de klerk had become a show so when mr de klerk announced on thursday that the national party would withdraw from president mandela s coalition government , it caused a brief flurry and then the sort of collective shrug that might greet any failed relationship in many ways , it makes no difference at all , said steve friedman , director of the center for policy studies , a johannesburg research firm the national party was finally getting around to saying that they did n't have that much influence beyond simply soothing white fears , the coalition was formed with the idea that the national party s presence would bring south africa s young democracy support from two important sectors big business and the military but it did not take long for the generals to decide they wanted to work for the main party in power , and business executives soon bypassed the national party to form their own ties to the anc mining industry executives , for instance , were reported to be extremely angry that the cabinet minister overseeing their sector was a national party official the industry wanted someone with clout , as one executive put it after surveying a number of business groups , mr friedman said , it is clear to him that none of them are remotely worried about the national party s departure there was no sign of alarm , he said but the division could cause some shortterm problems for south africa , discouraging foreign investment and depressing the rand , which has declined in value since mr de klerk s announcement the timing of the split the day after parliament overwhelmingly adopted a new constitution could also detract from the way in which the new law of the land is viewed , particularly among whites and the departure of the national party could heighten tensions between the anc and the third member in the coalition , the zulubased inkatha freedom party , which may try to expand its role , further straining its already difficult relationship with mr mandela s party but many experts said that the coalition had served its purpose and that it was time for the country to have an opposition party everybody has gotten used to the anc , said tom lodge , a professor of political science at the university of the witwatersrand it just does n't look like an ogre anymore the national party , however , now faces the difficult task of finding a place for itself in the new order when it leaves the government on june 30 , it will be the first time in 48 years that it has not been part of the government the last two years have left the party in some disarray wide disagreement about what course to set for the future seemed particularly evident in recent days with much fanfare , mr de klerk announced in february that he wanted to appeal to both blacks and whites but in the final weeks of negotiations over the constitution , he was locked in a very public battle over whether the document should establish the right to singlelanguage schools a measure that most blacks saw as a attempt by afrikaansspeakers to keep blacks out of whites' schools mr de klerk says he will build the national party back into the country s largest party but this is an unlikely scenario they carry a lot of baggage , said mr friedman this is the party that implemented apartheid , and blacks wo n't forget that for a long time

half a century ago , a young woman who had just graduated from cornell was watching a game at yankee stadium and got into conversation with a man in the next box his name was tobias stone , and since she seemed to be an enthusiastic and knowledgeable bridge player , he took her under his wing he taught her the rothstone system , then at the forefront of bridge theory , and took her to her first national championship her victory in the world mixed pairs in stockholm in 1970 was extraordinary , because her partner , waldemar von zedtwitz , had vision problems and could not see the dummy that was the start of a great career for that young woman , barbara srenco , soon to become barbara brier while working as a bridge teacher in miami beach , she won three national titles and one world title mrs brier died in august , and in florida last sunday , more than 100 of her friends attended a memorial service followed by a bridge game none of the competing experts managed a defense quite as neat as barbara srenco s effort as west in the eastern regional championships in 1948 her partner and abouttobe husband was jerry brier most modern players would open the south hand with one notrump , or , failing that , leap to three notrump on the third round after a strengthshowing reverse by north the opening lead was a spade , and south won the nine with the queen the jack would have been an error , giving away significant information south led the diamond king , and srenco dropped the queen this could have been disastrous if her partner had held a doubleton jack , but that seemed unlikely as it was , south continued diamonds , east gained the lead with the jack , and a spade return doomed the contract notice what would have happened if west had routinely played low under the diamond king south would then have been able to lose a trick to the queen whether or not that card was played on the next trick now , west would have had to guess whether to lead a second spade , shift to a heart or shift to a club looking at all four hands , it is easy to see that a club would have been right , but a spade or a heart could have been essential in a different layout by the imaginative play of dropping the diamond queen , srenco averted a difficult problem the autumn regional championships continue today at the sheraton meadowlands hotel , east rutherford , nj the schedule is today , stratiflighted open pairs and stratified senior pairs , 1 and 7 30 pm tomorrow , stratiflighted swiss teams and stratified senior swiss teams , each two sessions , 11 am monday , stratified open , women s and senior pairs , 11 am and 4 30 pm diagram
kladanj , bosnia and herzegovina , april 20 as his fellow soldiers sat on guard duty or loped through training exercises outside , sgt 1st class amos l hardy , a veteran of the persian gulf war , settled himself in for what now defines excitement for the boys of charlie company on the television screen , big men in brightly colored tights flailed about inside a wrestling ring as an announcer gave a blowbyblow account they were the world wrestling federation superstars , and the longhaired pretty boy known as the kid had his man down it would be a bloodbath , the announcer promised , and sgt hardy , 37 , from danville , va , as well as a growing audience of fellow soldiers , was eagerly anticipating the final blow this is the only action we get , he said dryly , as the voice on the screen announced lights out for a man withering on the mat this is as good as it gets when the men of company c , fourth battalion , 12th infantry arrived in bosnia last december , they expected action and danger , snipers in the hills and mortar rounds coming in the perimeter but the reality has been quite the opposite asked about dangers , they recite tales of icy roads , or concerns about ticks and mice carrying disease and they talk about training just in case they have to fight recounting small hills and easy tasks in the end , they are bored , terribly bored , cleaning weapons until the metal shines and changing the oil in their bradley fighting vehicles as often as workers at a quicklube garage we got fed up here the first week , said sergeant hardy i thought we would see some action thought it would be at least challenging i mean , desert storm was at least a challenge and you got a chance to do your job everything you train for was put to the test but here we got none of the above and nothing coming on the horizon other soldiers nodded in agreement with sergeant hardy , their eyes glazed after another day of busy work in their home of camp demi , halfway between sarajevo and tuzla while in some regions tensions have risen over the question of whether muslims and serbs can return to former homes now held by the other side , suggesting the possibility of conflict that could draw in american troops , so far charlie company has not faced any serious threats i expected a lot of shooting , said pvt daniel kline , from niagara falls , n y we expected people to be getting plugged in the streets , all over the place but it s calm , really slow here nowhere , man there is no drinking on the base and smoking is discouraged though the tedium has driven many to the lure others write letters home , or gaze at photos of their wives and girlfriends embracing the stereotype of a soldier away from home , the photos seem always to be plastered on the walls of their sixman trailers next to other pictures of scantily clad women they do not know in the breaks from hours of guard duty , they take a shower , or might play a game of touch football inside the compound but even here , there are rules to be followed and as they run down the small muddy field in their jogging suits or leave the bath house in their skivvies , the mandatory outside gear of camouflaged helmets always bobs on their heads concerns for safety have taken on a perverse logic , they said , explaining that they carry unloaded weapons while on duty because officers worried that soldiers faced with such boredom would become sloppy and forget to clear the breach before going to sleep but i 've learned that everything s not black and white here , and i see all the shades in between , said second lieut sean duvall , 24 , from tucson , ariz , thinking of his men s frustration for one thing , i see that my commanders have been given a plate they must deal with , and that when certain orders come down that i disagree with , it s not necessarily because the guy s a jerk lieutenant duvall added that the many quiet moments at camp demi are of some use , allowing him time for introspection before i came here , i did n't think much about the causes of the war , he said but now i look outside here and see this country where one day the neighbor who helped you build your house comes around and destroys it and you think to yourself that maybe , like with these orders , perception is the answer in this case , it s maybe that these people are basically the same and that they just ca n't see it because of other orders that keep them on the base unless on patrol , most american soldiers have little chance to talk with the people whose peace they came to enforce while the swedish battalion jogs on the road to tuzla , or the british and french forces go out for drinks and dinner in sarajevo , or mingle with the locals at the disco , these americans have little to ponder but america , wondering whether they should telephone their families again , or sit in front of the television waiting for another sitcom or more wrestling with nothing but the base for them , they count the days until they can leave and spend the minutes dreaming of home we fantasize about waking up next to our wives or girlfriends , instead of our buddies , and of some sweet voice in the morning calling you to breakfast , instead of a raspy noise telling you to get on guard duty , said specialist anthony galindo , 23 , from los angeles photos boredom is the biggest challenge for the american troops inbosnia wearing the helmets that are mandatory whenever they are outdoors , specialists emmanuel cross of georgia , steven choy of california , gerger nicholas of north dakota and kenneth geffers of wisconsin warmed up for a football game with time on his hands , staff sgt robert cook of baltimore relaxed recently in the back of a bradley fighting vehicle \( photographs by

so , you want to introduce several thousand new york city schoolchildren to the joys of shakespeare and demonstrate the relevance of yet another dead white male poet to their modern lives which play do you choose \? julius caesar \? they might even recognize some lines hamlet \? the ghost , fights and blood should get their attention not if you are jeffrey horowitz , the artistic chief of theater for a new audience , or his team of directors , who include barry kyle and julie taymor , among the most imaginative working today over the last two seasons , the company has staged titus andronicus , a sliceanddice look at a dysfunctional family , and the entire trilogy of henry vi , the wars of the roses as a miniseries its new production of measure for measure , an elizabethan view of the moral majority , will open saturday at the playhouse at st clement s church , on west 46th street in manhattan none are exactly the most popular in the canon we do n't choose plays just for the kids , mr horowitz emphasized the other day we are a professional theater company that has a program to bring students into the theater the choice of a play is based on typical theater concerns in fact , only a third of the audiences are schoolchildren mr kyle , who is directing measure for measure , and was the director for the henry vi plays last season , is not interested in just any play , but rather those that deal with public issues with civil strife flaring from the balkans to the caucasus , comparisons are easily drawn between the incipient nationalist movements around the world and the warring factions in henry vi the public issues mr kyle looks for are closer to home in measure for measure , a dark comedy that explores the consequences of a moralistic dictatorship at a time when secular government is under attack for perceived moral weakness from the militant wings of all three western religions , the play s modern parallels are not difficult to find also , the contemporary issue of sexual harassment runs throughout measure for measure , said mr kyle , who has directed for the royal shakespeare company , is about government it examines what we should expect from our leaders perhaps our moral expectations of them are unrealistically high during a break in rehearsal recently , he talked about what he called the guns and god atmosphere prevalent in much of the world today and asked what would happen if the religious right were in the oval office for one year \? a more immediate question for the company , though , is how to get children to identify with a play that scholars agree is one of shakespeare s most problematic we talk about themes , mr horowitz said we want the students to understand that plays are not something just to read but to be enacted beginning 17 years ago , with a traveling troupe that performed scenes from shakespeare plays in classrooms , mr horowitz has developed an educational program that currently operates on a 13 million annual budget twothirds of that sum comes from national , state and city agencies , corporate sponsors and individuals onethird derives from ticket sales and board of education contracts today , he said , the theater for a new audience involves some 5 , 000 city students annually from the fourth through the 12th grades in every borough the company averages between 10 and 15 visits each year to public schools , he explained , both before and after the students see a performance of one of the new audience productions that program is combined with another in which students write their own plays under the guidance of a visiting playwright and then watch as professional actors perform staged readings sharon o 'reilly , a teacher at south shore high school in the canarsie section of brooklyn , said the attention the new audience actors give the students' work is crucial all of a sudden , it s 'gosh , they 're reading my words , ' ms o 'reilly said to hear professionals take an interest tells them that what they are doing matters all the students will see one of the company s two annual presentations the second production this season will be carlo gozzi s green bird gozzi was an 18thcentury venetian who wrote fables for the theater , including the love of three oranges and the raven these fantastic romances lend themselves to the kind of spectacular stagings that ms taymor , one of the most original talents designing and directing in theater and opera today , is known for for the company , she has staged the tempest , the taming of the shrew and the vivid titus andronicus of 1994 because of the dark nature of measure for measure , only older students will see mr kyle s guns and god version of it younger students in the program will see the green bird , which will be staged in march in the refurbished new victory theater on west 42d street perhaps the most surprising aspect of the theater for a new audience is how a company that has gained favorable recognition from critics and students has remained so little known to the general public mr horowitz smiled wistfully at the observation mostly it s because of our short season , he said we run only two or three months a year nobody hears about us from the end of march until the following january , even though we 're in the schools the brevity of the season is another reason the company does not have a larger subscription base , which many nonprofit theaters in new york say is vital to financial security mr horowitz said the company has about 500 subscribers to expand our subscription base , we would have to do more than two shows , he said but i would rather do two really good shows a year than four or five on a shoestring mr horowitz is striving to build a core company of actors and directors to give continuity to the company some performers in measure for measure have appeared in past company productions and its audience serious theatergoers as well as new york city schoolchildren have come to expect visually exciting and intelligently staged work children , in fact , as every actor , director and playwright knows , can be among the harshest critics ms o 'reilly , the brooklyn teacher , also knows a lot of my students have never seen a play before , or read shakespeare , she said but the new audience productions they see are full of action and the language differences really disappear every year , all the way home on the subway and it s an hour s ride the students are talking about the play photos bill camp , above , rehearses in measure for measure , directed by barry kyle , left \( photographs by jim estrin the new york times \)
nearly three years after an outbreak of lung disease caused by hantavirus on a navajo reservation in the southwest brought the disease to the attention of scientists , federal statistics show that the number of cases is rising slowly and remaining largely in the west the number of confirmed cases has reached 131 nationwide , and almost half have been fatal , the centers for disease control and prevention in atlanta said yesterday more than 50 of the 131 cases occurred before the reservation outbreak , said dr joel williams , a medical epidemiologist at the centers those diagnoses were made retrospectively from tissue or serum samples researchers are still trying to find out why some people are susceptible to the viral infection while others who are presumed to have had similar exposures are not they are also looking at regional variations in virus strains and the types of rodents that carry the virus the disease can be spread by several common rodent species and has been found in 24 states it is most common in new mexico , which has had 28 cases in arizona , 21 cases , and in california , 13 but hantavirus does not appear to be highly infectious it is nearly always found among people in isolated cases the cdc reports only four instances in which more than one case occurred at about the same time and place the latest multiple occurrence affected two men from south dakota last year , the agency said they worked at the same feedlot and lived together , so researchers are not sure whether they were exposed to saliva or feces from infected rodents at home or at work both men recovered hantavirus begins as a flulike illness and can be mistaken for other diseases in the south dakota cases , the first man who became ill left the hospital with physicians thinking that he had hepatitis , inflammation of the pancreas or both he was tested for hantavirus only after his coworker became ill and hantavirus was discovered one study looking at regional variation focused on new york state , where two people have contracted hantavirus and died in that study , published in the current issue of the archives of internal medicine by researchers at the new york state department of health , the centers and elsewhere , researchers found 48 other cases in the state in which patients exhibited the clinical symptoms of pulmonary hantavirus infection , but none appeared to have the antibodies to the virus that would confirm a diagnosis nearly all the patients were infected in 1993 or 1994 the researchers said they could not rule out the possibility that some of these patients might have been infected by hantavirus some might have had too few hantavirus antibodies to show up on tests or could have been infected by new strains of the disease , said one researcher , dr dale l morse , director of epidemiology at the health department the results are generally reassuring , dr morse added , even though hantavirus infection was found among groups of whitefooted mice , particularly on long island and in lower hudson valley in both confirmed hantavirus cases contracted in new york , the patients are thought to have been exposed to infected mice on long island dr williams of the cdc said people should be cautious , even though hantavirus is a rare disease assume all rodent excreta is infected until proven otherwise , he said epidemiologists say people should handle rodent droppings only after spraying them with disinfectant and should wear gloves
somerville , mass katie cameron , a mother at 18 , and her toddler son , shaun , sleep under the glow of the stars that she pasted on the ceiling of their tiny bedroom from the wall over the head of her bed , she took a framed document , a high school diploma dated july 28 , 1996 this is my second pride and joy , after shaun , she said a year ago , ms cameron was living in an apartment with her mother , younger sister and brother , fending off the blows of a heroinaddicted boyfriend shaun , now 20 months old , was in the hands of the massachusetts department of social services , which had taken him from his mother , she said , to protect him from domestic violence mother and son found structure and refuge here at the just a start home for teenage mothers , one of 18 in massachusetts that serve as national models for adultsupervised homes that the new federal welfare law asks states to establish these secondchance homes , an updated version of the victorian homes for unwed mothers , ride 24hour herd on their charges , providing child care while teaching the mothers homemaking and childrearing skills and seeing that they finish high school as a society , the state secretary for health and human services , joseph gallant , said , we say we 've got to take control of these kids who are out there on their own if there is n't a family there , we 're providing the family about a halfdozen states are operating such homes or considering them , and several hundred additional conventional maternity homes across the nation could be redesigned to meet the terms of the law but the homes are expensive massachusetts pays 40 , 000 a year to support each mother , three to four times the cost of food stamps and welfare checks and many states are likely to find that this is another program in the sweeping new welfare law that they will be hardpressed to afford the number of mothers under 18 , like ms cameron , may be minuscule , put at 67 , 000 of the 41 million women who received welfare nationally in 1993 but experts say giving them a hand early is critical to breaking the cycle of dependence that is because the mothers and their children form an intractable core of the welfare system people who start on welfare early and stay for years , often into the next generation seventyseven percent of teenage mothers start receiving welfare checks within five years of having babies , and they make up 43 percent of all longterm welfare recipients , said kathleen sylvester , a vice president of the progressive policy institute and the source of much of congress s research on secondchance homes the massachusetts homes , which were first opened a year ago , house 79 teenagers , and the state plans four additional centers its network of homes is the first to meet the new law s requirement that the youngest mothers live with parents or adult relatives or in secondchance homes to be eligible for welfare checks in massachusetts , the mothers have to stay until they are 18 they may choose to live in the homes until they are 20 as long as they attend school the homes are so new that they have skimpy track records their backers say they believe that the homes offer more hope than the alternative , simply giving a young mother cash and food stamps without strings or supervision indeed , the homes have aroused little opposition , aside from their expense , among welfare critics on the left or right in massachusetts , the mothers contribute 30 percent of their 446 monthly welfare checks and pool their food stamps for the community kitchen like other young mothers in the home in somerville , ms cameron was driven here by poverty she was born in boston , and her parents divorced soon after the birth of her brother and sister , who are also now teenagers she said that her father was an alcoholic and that she had not seen him since she was 5 the family bounded from town to town and apartment to apartment , on welfare and periodically homeless i was on the street at 11 1 2 , doing a lot of stupid stuff , ms cameron said in the spring of 1994 , when she was 15 , she missed her period she told her boyfriend , brian , that she was pregnant , and a few days later he asked four male friends to come over they had a kind of blanket party , ms cameron said they threw a blanket over my head and pushed me down and beat me up she suspected that brian wanted to force a miscarriage , but the baby held on , and brian disappeared within weeks , she took up with another boy , shaun , who moved in with her and her family shaun , who is now serving 18 months for assaulting someone else , saw her through her pregnancy so tenderly that katie named the child shaun jr but he was on heroin , she said , and started treating me like garbage she lost custody of the baby they said i was hurting my baby because i could n't get away from shaun , ms cameron said now , she added , she is through with shaun for ms cameron , having a child was a jolt i

pittsburgh , may 4 in a radio interview before the stanley cup playoff series with pittsburgh , ranger coach colin campbell discussed the character of the penguins well , sometimes , with the kind of talent they have , you can call them crybabies , soft guys , campbell said on wfanam the new york coach and his staff members strongly objected to this quote being taken out of context when it was published the next day because right after saying it , campbell went on to praise some real character types on the penguins , especially mario lemieux , who has triumphed over medical problems he also called petr nedved a really good kid who just did n't fit us in our system before the rangers traded him to pittsburgh and he mentioned the scoring power of sergei zubov , ron francis and jaromir jagr perhaps campbell and his rangers really do admire the penguins , who beat them by 43 friday night in game 1 of the eastern conference semifinals , a game that included cheap shots and writhing athletes game 2 is sunday afternoon here at the civic arena certainly the rangers respect jagr and lemieux so much that today after practice campbell said he is considering huge adjustments and a lot of alternatives to the way they cover these two stars they might assign individual shadows to check them , campbell said when you start to shadow one or two players , campbell said , they do n't like it obviously , mario lemieux and jaromir jagr require adjustments we 'll probably have to change some things around in a great way you would n't expect after game 1 , the rangers might have lost some regard for good kid nedved , who fell to the ice in apparent pain after an unprovoked slash on the right hand from the stick of mark messier , the ranger captain , in the second period , when the game was still scoreless you do n't know when a player is hurt or not on a play , campbell said the embellishing goes on quite a bit now in our league it s not just a problem with petr nedved the moment proved pivotal on the ensuing penalty against messier , jagr scored a powerplay goal , set up by character type lemieux jagr , who was cut in the face early in the game by messier s unpenalized stick , later scored another goal , and he set up lemieux for the gamewinner penguins coach eddie johnston said he expects ranger defenseman ulf samuelsson to be on the ice more against jagr in game 2 forwards who might be considered for shadow detail are bill berg , campbell said , and shane churla sometimes a shadow s tactics include harassment and hard hitting campbell said the rangers did n't hit hard enough friday night we have to play more physical in terms of going through people , campbell said one example might be zubov , the former ranger who came to pittsburth with nedved in the trade that brought luc robitaille and samuelsson to new york this past season the rangers think zubov will give up the puck if pressured in his own end this is what soft guys do , although who would dare call zubov such a thing \? we did n't tag zubie as much as we would like , campbell said they did tag big francois leroux , who was crosschecked while kneeling by churla that gave the penguins a fourminute power play campbell noted today that kevin lowe of the rangers was yelling at leroux for allegedly exaggerating his pain leroux is a big , tough guy , campbell said he went down like a california redwood in a more general sense , campbell said modern players sometimes cry wolf to create power plays the rough stuff and writhing came from both sides who s to say what s real \? when jagr scored his second goal of the game , later in the second period , ranger forward jari kurri was lying on the ice , the bleeding victim of a high stick from pittsburgh s dave roche it might have seemed that kurri was trying to call attention to an unpenalized foul lest someone think one of his players is a crybaby or a soft guy , campbell said older players do n't lay on the ice too long presumably not unless they have a good reason campbell noted that the buildup to the series painted the rangers as the bad guys who must whack and hack to compete with pittsburgh s talent campbell also made light of skip thayer , the chunky pittsburgh trainer , who ran on the ice more than once to treat injured penguins skip s going to lose a lot of weight if he continues this marathon , campbell said robitaille , slashed at the end of the game by zubov , said zubov s slash was a retaliation for something robitaille did moments before zubov got a fiveminute major and a game misconduct despite the foul , robitaille did n't remain on the ice or cry about it he s a ranger part of the game , he said it s a long series perhaps robitaille read the zubov quote earlier in the week that suggested robitaille is overpaid for the 23 goals he produced but , in a rivalry like this one , you can believe only half of what you hear , some or none of what you see for instance if you saw brian leetch get trapped deep in pittsburgh territory when the penguins rushed the other way to tie the score , 33 , at 7 minutes 44 seconds of the third period , you might have thought it was a mistaken gamble by the rangers' norris trophy candidate the way leetch figured it , he said , the gamble was worth it because he had lemieux safely tied up with him when roche and glen murray went the other way on a twoonone break that ended with roche s goal today , campbell blamed the goal not on leetch but on ranger forwards who handled the puck poorly in front of the net while leetch was behind it leetch also was on the ice for lemieux s tiebreaking gamewinner , at 12 43 of the third period because the rangers were caught in a personnel change , leetch was paired with bruce driver , not his usual partner jagr danced into the ranger zone , then feinted and spun driver as if he were isabelle duchesnay then he drew leetch toward him before sliding the puck to the uncovered lemieux , who beat goalie mike richter photo jaromir jagr dropped to the ice but kept control of the puck as the rangers' jari kurri skated in during the penguins' game 1 victory friday night \( associated press \)
kansas city , mo deborah c washam shook her head with an emotion that appeared to be equal parts sorrow and exasperation of the more than 80 women she has hired over the last 17 months as part of a generous welfaretowork program sponsored in part by this city s corporate community , fewer than 25 remain on the job many of the others quit in a huff over perceived slights to their dignity mrs washam calls it their refusal to follow directions i do n't think they 've had much exposure to structure in their lives , said mrs washam , president and chief executive of community home health care , a licensed agency that dispatches homemakers to assist elderly and disabled residents of kansas city s urban core with light housework and shopping as single mothers , they are on their own and think of themselves as authority figures , mrs washam said they wo n't take routine supervision at work president clinton , in accepting the democratic nomination on thursday , declared a moral obligation under the welfare reform act he signed two weeks ago to move americans off welfare and into jobs but the magnitude of this task seems best appreciated by those already dealing with the challenge overcoming years of dependency on openended entitlement programs is daunting , those who administer welfaretowork efforts say employers express satisfaction with new employees who show initiative and a willingness to learn , even when that has required training in rudiments like the proper way to answer phones but as the program here shows , business people are frustrated by many welfare veterans many among those hired , while the most qualified of those screened , have problems that include absenteeism , lack of discipline about work hours , poor reading and communications skills , and open resentment when given direction and the current programs have not even reached people on welfare who have more serious problems , like alcohol and drug abuse or low intelligence these concerns resonate nationally with business leaders , who are only beginning to figure out employers' roles as the states begin a trek this fall into uncharted territory under mandates that those on welfare must find work or face the loss of benefits for themselves and their children in the view of the smallbusiness person , welfare is right up there with balancing the budget as what s wrong with big government , said jeffrey r joseph , vice president for domestic policy at the united states chamber of commerce yet the average business person or the average politician , for that matter has no clue as to what s coming now that the welfare bill has been passed they want welfare people to go out and work , but there s a big difference between visceral reactions and actually dealing with programs that can help lead them to work mr joseph said a hodgepodge of plans had been advanced to ease the welfaretowork transition , adding that the national picture is more confused than coherent those with low unemployment are serious about finding reasonable ways of accomplishing the goals of reform they need every worker they can get , he explained areas with high unemployment and low sophistication , where they ca n't figure out what to do with people who already have skills , may be less interested what is role of business \? president clinton challenged every business person in america who has ever complained about the failure of the welfare system to try to hire somebody off welfare , and try hard yet some leaders of business groups are blunt in disavowing any suggestion that the private sector should assume responsibility for making welfare reform work business is not in the business of providing jobs for welfare recipients , robert t jones , president and chief executive officer of the national alliance of business , said in a telephone interview before the president s speech , contending that it is up to the states to prepare people for entering the work force still , some communities notably places where unemployment is low and unskilled workers are in demand have already undertaken efforts to move welfare recipients into the work force in tulsa , okla , for example , the metropolitan chamber of commerce created a nonprofit corporation in 1992 to train adults on welfare for assembly and manufacturing jobs at companies that pick up the training costs tim westberry , the program manager , said that in the first eight months of 1996 , 60 fulltime and 13 temporary jobs were filled by the heads of families on aid to families with dependent children who underwent training with them the overall retention rate , he said , is above 80 percent over the history of the program in indianapolis , existing communitybased groups accustomed to assisting the urban poor with housing and other social needs have redirected their energies , with the aid of business leaders , to find work for those on welfare functional illiteracy and alcoholism are the biggest barriers to employment for our clients , said the rev john hay , a minister who runs a community center on the city s east side , where whites account for 80 percent of the afdc caseload here in kansas city , an alliance called the local investment commission , or linc , financed by public and private sources , is quietly shaping a model of innercity dynamics for the postwelfare world
what happened in iowa may be old news now that the horse race gallops on to new hampshire but for anyone who saw the gaybashing rally that ended the caucus campaign on a chilling note saturday night , iowa cannot be forgotten so easily at the first federated church in des moines , the christian coalition and seven other national religiousright organizations came together to demonize homosexuals and the prospect of samesex marriage as the source of all ills in america , urging a national cspan audience to send this evil life style back to satan where it came from ! and every gop presidential candidate with the single honorable exception of richard lugar endorsed the event by either showing up on stage or distributing a public letter of support this was not , unfortunately , an isolated incident gay bashing was a major strain of the gop campaign in iowa from the start now the iowa paradigm will spread from state to state under the twin banners of pat buchanan and ralph reed unless supposed moderate conservatives like bob dole and lamar alexander find the courage they have so far lacked to stand up to the bullies of the religious right in iowa , the ugliness began last year when phil gramm joined a successful effort by bill horn the same antigay zealot who organized saturday s rally to oust a longtime des moines school board member because he was gay \( the campaign s target had to wear a bulletproof vest before the school board election was over \) when mr gramm then tied mr dole in the iowa straw poll , mr dole s panicked campaign got into the gaybashing act itself by returning a contribution it had solicited from the gay log cabin republicans in recent weeks , the gay bashing has been aimed , none too subtly , at steve forbes whatever else is to be said of mr forbes , his ballooning popularity posed a threat to the perceived power of the christian coalition , because he was rising in polls without its support and despite having once dismissed its leader , pat robertson , as a toothy flake since mr forbes s views about social issues were \( and are \) too blurry to stigmatize , the religious right attacked him by innuendo instead for having a gay father a week ago mr horn spread the news that a forbes company yacht boasted a seascape by a gay artist , robert mapplethorpe \( good thing forbes never bought the mona lisa \) steve forbes at first responded to such mccarthyite tactics by taking on the christian coalition by name the only candidate since arlen specter with the guts to do so but he quickly retreated under fire , until he was reduced to fudging his positions on abortion and gays in the military and parading his wife and children around iowa by the end of the week his campaign had sent its own message of support to saturday s rally even as that night s episode of saturday night live , confirming the efficacy of the iowa smear campaign , featured a dole impersonator gaybaiting his forbes counterpart where will this ugliness lead \? for all mr dole s kowtowing to the religious right s troops , mr buchanan remains by far their candidate of choice nor is there any evidence to suggest that demonizing homosexuals helps win national elections quite the contrary mr dole s campaign went into a tailspin after it returned the log cabin republicans' donation on monday , log cabin s executive director , richard tafel , likened saturday s rally to the selfimmolating houston convention of '92 and singled out mr dole and lamar alexander , both of whom issued letters legitimizing the event , for blatant pandering to gay bashers but there is more than politics at stake in a conversation over the weekend , bill crews , a lifelong , churchgoing republican who is the mayor of melbourne , iowa and openly gay told me how he and other gay iowans have been the victims of vandals and beatings in the aftermath of past local rabblerousing mr crews , who had been planning to vote for mr alexander , publicly withdrew his support on the eve of the caucus because of his candidate s tacit endorsement of saturday s rally but what does mr alexander care \? he and his peers have taken their act to new hampshire now , oblivious to the hatred they helped stir up in iowa and callously indifferent to how it rains down on the lives they 've left behind
everyone who has seen roy jones jr do his jetes and plies and soliloquies while beating up opponents has been wondering what else can this remarkable fighter do to make it interesting \? after all , there was his basketballintheafternoon , titledefenseatnight shtick of last june there was talk of a night doubleheader defending his super middleweight \( 168pound \) title , then going after the lightheavyweight crown a few minutes later but on friday night , at the aptly named theater at madison square garden , he unveiled the latest wrinkle a prefight lecture to the live and hbo audience he sat in a swivel chair in the ring as if he were the nightly news anchor he fielded questions from a panel of sportswriters and took questions from the audience he followed it with a master class in the sweet science against another foil bryant brannon , like the others before him , does n't want to be a foil it s just that no one in the world is as good as jones , the 168pounder who moves so quickly he asks ringsiders how many punches in a row he has thrown this was another quickie for jones a secondround technical knockout after he had knocked down brannon for the third time in the fight the undefeated jones threw only seven jabs , landing none but he connected on more than 100 power punches in fewer than six minutes in recording his 29th knockout in 33 bouts asked by reporters why he did n't listen to jones , who asked him to stop the fight after the first knockdown of the second round , the referee ron lipton said , if i stopped the fight when jones asked me to , you would have been all over me later , jones announced he would be fighting the world boxing organization middleweight champion , lonnie bradley , in november jones is really looking for a major fight in january , perhaps against the world boxing association super middleweight ruler , ron lyles only jones , though , could fight another champion and consider it a tuneup and only jones could dare or is good enough to throw seven consecutive left hooks why does he do this sort of thing \? jones wagged his head from side to side like one of those dolls attached to the dashboard of a car when a guy gets hit that many times , he said , imitating brannon s head movement , he says , 'no , no , no , i ca n't beat this guy' brannon had been an undefeated performer from trenton , ranked no 1 by the international boxing federation yet he gave himself virtually no chance thus , he tried the tactic that was doomed when peter mcneeley attempted it against mike tyson charge out at the opening bell and hope maybe a roundhouse right would connect with jones it was the only way he could fight him , conceded brannon s promoter , russell peltz i kind of figured he might try that , said jones , who spends much of his free time between fights training in a hometown gym in pensacola , fla what else could he do \? he s 58 i'm 511 when you 're fighting a guy like me , that big , who s fast , smart , a genius he was fighting a smart fight but what he did n't know was the gun was loaded the head of hbo sports , seth abraham , said he had decided to have the unusual prefight q and a because there is a perception that jones is ducking tough fighters this bothers jones , who explained to the audience that , actually , they are the ones ducking him that he has made milliondollar offers to topranked middleweights \( 160 pounds \) and even lightheavyweights \( 176 pounds \) , including other champions perhaps but many of these rumors began because hbo itself was unhappy over the quality of some of jones s opponents it pays him millions of dollars a fight and for some time has contended privately that jones only wants opponents he can dominate while he does his star turns the garden crowd of 3 , 829 fans also was treated to a tougherthanexpected 12rounder between the wba welterweight champion , ike quartey of ghana , and oba carr of detroit at the 140pound limit two judges gave quartey the nod while a third called the bout even it had odd moments such as quartey losing a point from the referee arthur mercante sr for rabbitpunching , while carr lost points in two rounds for low blows in the 11th , an obvious slip by quartey was ruled a knockdown by mercante still , quartey stretched his unbeaten record to 33 bouts the decision was punctuated by friends from ghana waving flags and playing drums
with the end of the republican national convention , republicans , democrats and independent voters around the nation reacted to the fourday event bainbridge island , wash from the titanic to a lifeboat for bob dole , after proclaiming himself anew the most optimistic man in america , the ferry ride from seattle to this island in puget sound was only about halffull of reasons why he should feel such a lift it was certainly not the titanic , the fated ship that had become the symbol of choice for many people in the days leading up to the republican national convention people are giving mr dole a second chance they say they saw some things in him more humanity , less of a nasty edge that they had not seen before there is an opening and there are fresh doubts about president clinton but interviews with dozens of people from tourists on vacation to morning commuters disclosed that mr dole had not brought too many of the undecided voters or wavering republicans home just yet what came across repeatedly , from people who called themselves republicans as well as from democrats and independents , was how much people used to perceive mr dole as an old , essentially lifeless candidate the main thing he did was seem a little more human , a little less like a robot , said andrew biviano , a yale student home in seattle for the summer before , i thought he was a harsh , mean man whose policies i did n't agree with now i see him as just a man whose policies i disagree with mr biviano said mr dole had impressed him on a couple of counts , though not enough to win his vote the one line i remember from the speech was the one that was in all the papers , mr biviano said , about how he would n't just throw out all the poor people that s good because everyone thinks that convention was all millionaires a houston republican , terri bourne , saw none of the convention except for mr dole s speech , and what she saw surprised her he seemed to have so much more energy than i thought he would have , said ms bourne , who works for an oil company her husband , darden bourne , said he had yet to make up his mind he is on vacation and has barely read a newspaper or watched television , he said many people said they had only heard about the convention from friends or on the radio what they heard was the offer of tax cuts , but that worked both ways for mr dole rick debarros , a real estate agent from bainbridge island who described himself as an undecided voter , said i do n't vote for parties i vote for people and what caught my attention was the stuff about lowering the taxes and creating opportunity he added , i had pretty much given up on the republican party , but now i would say my mind is open but the tax cut proposals cost mr dole support as well , particularly among independents charles averill , a venture capitalist who lives on bainbridge island and works in seattle , said what convinced me to stay undecided was bob dole talking about tax cuts i'm not very excited about that because it s already been tried a republican , mr averill has been drifting away from the party , he said , because of the influence of christian conservatives the line that mr averill remembered from mr dole s speech did not exactly leave the impression the candidate wanted when i heard dole say he can be the bridge between two generations , i thought that was a pretty funny thing , mr averill said he s the bridge between my grandparents and their parents some republicans gave mixed reviews to the effort to close the gender gap by highlighting representative susan molinari of staten island and elizabeth dole , the candidate s wife out west , ms molinari s name is not yet a household word that marinari woman and mrs dole did very well for women , said robert boff , a pilot who is a strong republican in general , mr boff said , most of the conflicts within the party , from the issue of abortion to women s rights , are mediagenerated problems two passionate republicans from the midwest who are firmly in the dole camp said the only thing they did not really like about the convention had been the event that generally received raves from others mrs dole s walk and talk through the audience it was a little melodramatic , grace mcartor , of memphis , said her friend , robin mathews , from omaha , said , she sounded like an evangelist among the people who called themselves democrats , there was dismissal , and an occasional smidgen of respect , for a wellstaged convention i have n't heard anyone talking about it nothing , said tuyetlan demick , of edmonds , north of seattle her friend , an architect , agreed they are both democrats when pressed , the architect , who spoke on the condition that she not be named , said

east rutherford , nj who would have thought five years ago that an expansion team in miami would reach the stanley cup finals in its third season and have the best record in the national hockey league in its fourth \? and who would have thought that this team could visit the previous cup champions on a beautiful december night and sell only 12 , 032 tickets in a building that seats more than 19 , 000 \? that was the case last night when the florida panthers brought their 1636 record to continental arena to play the devils by stressing defense and zone trapping , these two teams have slowly but surely influenced the style of their sport in recent seasons and they have changed it for the worse although this game matched the 1995 champions against the 1996 runnersup , the boxoffice appeal could be seen in the empty seats i was surprised to see there was not a lot of people , said jacques lemaire , the devils' coach i wish we would have a little more denis potvin , the islander hall of famer who works as a panthers broadcaster , said he was n't sure about the official attendance count i do n't know if they had 8 , 000 here tonight , he said i was very surprised asked if the conservative style might be the reason , potvin said maybe nobody sat there and expected a highscoring game they did n't get one the devils won by 20 , but one of those goals was into an empty net in the final minute to the roar of thousands of yawns last night s customers witnessed a brand of hockey that looked like college football in the 1970 s when woody hayes of ohio state coached against bo schembechler of michigan as was the case in those big ten showdowns , both of these hockey teams played it safe and waited for the other to make more mistakes so alike are the devils and the panthers that if they made a movie about this game , the title would be something like the mirror has two faces asked if the panthers and devils were mirror images of each other , florida coach doug maclean said i do n't see that no he said his team is more aggressive in the neutral zone well , whatever teams that play this cautiously tend to make their goaltenders look good while relying on them more than they should new jersey s martin brodeur and florida s john vanbiesbrouck both sparkled for brodeur , it was the first victory after three defeats and one controversial benching in colorado when the backup goalie mike dunham started against the avalanche last saturday , it embarrassed brodeur during intermissions , brodeur reportedly sat outside the locker room in the corridor lemaire said then that brodeur might have been tired in an interview with the newspaper la presse of montreal , brodeur said i guess he knows better than me i did n't go and speak to jacques he s not much of a talker he makes the decisions and you 've got to accept them brodeur was only a little milder in his comments last night me and jacques did a good job of not pointing fingers at each other , brodeur said if i get pulled next game , it s just going to be all over again the issue of pulling is sensitive because dunham must appear in 25 games or become a free agent he has played in 7 of 23 so far a few of those appearances have been short , including one cameo for less than a minute such tricks fulfill the letter of the law while violating its spirit we 're watching the situation , said bob goodenow , executive director of the national hockey league players association , and we 're aware of dunham s starts we 'll make sure that nothing improper occurs how typical of the devils , and general manager lou lamoriello , to create a crisis where none is needed if brodeur dares to say much more , lamoriello might dispatch him in the manner of neil broten or claude lemieux or mike peluso the boss may not be always right , but he s always the boss as for the other players last night , it was interesting to see how the panthers reacted to penalties called against them by the referee , don van massenhoven they skated to the box complaining with disbelieving looks on their faces as if to say , hey , we get away with obstruction every game and they usually do expansion has opened more roster room for grinders remember last season s crackdown against obstruction tactics \? it s gone in 1996 , boys just clutch and grab and play the body because the panthers combine obstruction with great effort and discipline , the officials usually let them get away with it and they usually win and if the league keeps putting on shows like this , there wo n't be too many customers left to be bored by them
you 're going out there a youngster , warner baxter warns the young ruby keeler at the climax of the 1933 film fortysecond street , but you 've got to come back a star ! baxter s urgent tone reflects a terror of unemployment at the height of the depression two hundred people ! , he emphasizes two hundred jobs ! nevertheless , keeler s splitsecond glance of elation as she cases the auditorium after stepping on stage tells us her agenda is less social welfare than that great american privilege , fame this is reasonable this is theater throughout its golden age of jerome kern , rodgers and hart , the gershwins and cole porter , the broadway musical specialized in the induction of fresh talent just as keeler replaces an injured \( but also aging , therefore , as hollywood sees it , powerless \) bebe daniels in fortysecond street , so there was a constant absorption and elevation of newcomers that s all finished now the musical has lost the ability to sustain the integration of new star talent when a uniquely charismatic performer does appear , there is no followup role to proclaim his or her arrival no funny girl , say , to celebrate the discovery of a barbra streisand in i can get it for you wholesale , a show she stole so thoroughly that she made one of the greatest showbiz careers not only possible but absolutely necessary \( even if it took her away from the theater for life \) this is why theatergoers have been so enthusiastic about the appearance , in a single season , of three of the most popular musicalcomedy stars of the postworld war ii era carol channing , julie andrews and carol burnett \( though ms burnett , in a comedy , is n't singing \) this trio recalls a time in broadway s history when going out there a youngster and coming back a star meant something to the great majority of americans today , the culture looks elsewhere for its showbiz stars to the movies , as always , but also to television , pop music , even politics and crime theater , in 1990 s america , is a backwater but when the young carol channing made her debut in the revue lend an ear in 1948 , revealing a hitandrun personality and a voice that covers every note between moan and squeak , it was virtually a cultural imperative that she be feted or tested , perhaps \? in another show , this time in a star part as ms channing had won particular notice in a spoof of 20 s musicals in lend an ear , her next engagement the following year was a 20 s spinoff , gentlemen prefer blondes , in which she played that decade s most essential gold digger , the cunning yet loopy lorelei lee oddly , julie andrews also arrived in a burlesque of the 20 s , the english musical the boy friend , in 1954 but where ms channing was daffy , ms andrews was cool , elegant , porcelain with a human face after a little coaching in cockney style , she was not only a natural but inevitable as eliza doolittle in my fair lady , a mating of actor and character as symmetrical as clark gable playing rhett butler carol burnett too made her broadway debut in a period burlesque , the princess and the pea spoof , once upon a mattress , in 1959 as winifred the woebegone , the princess herself , ms burnett stood out in a company of nine principals for a broadness of gesture that is oddly down to earth in its effect like a 'edieval court jester , she expresses what we 're all feeling an eagerness to please , an impatience with fools and a gratitude for kindness she just does it the way general patton made war once again , the musical s gods of tradition and destiny demanded that she be given a main chance after five years as television s favorite singing comic , she too graced broadway in a star part , the usheretteturnedmovieidol in fade out fade in this ceaseless cultivation of innovative talent gave the musical a vital sense of continuity , of being able to command its own history however , not long after the accession of ms channing , ms andrews and ms burnett , the system broke down when was the last truly important star discovered and nurtured on broadway \? ms streisand \? that was 30 years ago what happened \? ensemble shows , for one thing the dark , sophisticated concept musicals such as company , grand hotel , the secret garden these are operettas for grownups , problem plays too finely textured to endure a star turn moreover , the rise of pop opera has created gigantic constructions that overwhelm performer charisma with roller dome races and helicopter takeoffs , and whose popularity extends so far beyond the theatergoing community that they become tourist attractions , like the hansom cabs in central park or the hard rock cafe do tourists really care who s playing jean valjean this week \? there is as well the current emphasis on revivals literally , as if trying to pump a heartbeat into a moribund form by resuscit'ting the classics within the last generation , broadway has seen major reappearances of oklahoma ! , brigadoon , west side story , guys and dolls , carousel and now show boat , none of which demands headliners
everett , wash , oct 31 all day long , richard a gephardt earnestly sought support for democrats running against republican freshmen , telling how gingrich s robots had voted against medicare , or education , or pension security but real passion gripped his voice for the first time when mr gephardt , the house minority leader , denounced the republicans to 150 boeing machinists in their union hall they methodically went after everything that has been on the books to help working people , to help unions and to help collective bargaining they tried to defund the nlrb they tried to cut out the safety laws that were painstakingly put on the books with your help 20 and 30 years ago they tried to gut the wage and hour laws so that you could be shifted around , willynilly , by employers , no matter what you thought representative gephardt is running for speaker of the house , not in the traditional way of trying to line up votes in the democratic caucus but in the way that newt gingrich did it two years ago he is trying to get a majority elected for a party he already leads mr gephardt has traveled the nation continually for the last four weeks , stumping for challengers and , between stops , fielding their requests for money on a cellular telephone working his way up the west coast from southern california this week , he told interviewers and audiences that the democrats' crushing loss in 1994 taught them that they needed to be moderate he says that with a narrow majority , which is the most they can hope for , the democrats will try every day to find republicans to work with and to pass their modest families first program , which emphasizes measures like tax deductions for college tuition payments the congressman , a 20year house veteran from st louis , usually stops short of predicting that the democrats will gain the 18 seats they need for a majority i am optimistic , he said over dinner in portland , ore , on wednesday , but there are a lot of uncertainties and i'm from missouri , so you have got to show me my sense , he said , is that as they got a wave in '94 , we can get a counterwave in '96 i think it s happening , because of what they did with the budget the government shutdown has offended people it has angered people mr gephardt , the son of a milktruck driver who belonged to the teamsters' union , acknowledges that if the democrats do regain control , the decisive factor will have been the help from organized labor but he bridles at the suggestion that the aflcio would expect to be repaid for its help , a demand that could shatter the fragile , moderate majority he hopes to manage i 've never had anybody in labor at the national level , or the local level , say , 'if you win , you 're going to do something for us , ' he said no one has ever even mentioned it mr gephardt has a few stock lines in his stump speech he uses the word immoral to describe republicans' cuts in education and what he describes as their threats to medicare and pensions he often quotes a mission controller in the movie apollo 13 who told technicians trying to construct a makeshift oxygen filter in an hour that failure is not an option the washington state delegation offers the democrats some of the best hunting in the nation , with six republican freshmen all facing serious challenges mr gephardt campaigned on thursday with three of the democratic challengers standing with two candidates from the seattle area , jeff coopersmith and kevin quigley , he told a fundraising audience here we can win one seat , or two seats or we can win six seats this state is the mother lode failure is not an option we 've got to do this at thursday s event , held at the home of helen jackson , widow of senator henry m jackson , mr gephardt praised thomas s foley , mr gingrich s predecessor as speaker he said mr foley , who represented spokane for 30 years until losing in 1994 , was the essence of reaching out and being bipartisan , of being moderate , of being someone who respected that tradition in the house in these last two years , he complained , there has been none of that i mean , none of that from mr gingrich i think if there is one thing that has so angered people and put people off with our government , he said , it is the sense that we are all up there just bashing one another , cracking flour sacks over each other s heads , and that we do n't have any care or worry about the public good and i pledge to you that if we get this chance , we will make you proud photo richard a gephardt addressing boeing machinists on thursday \( larry davis for the new york times \)

rossiniere , switzerland i was born in this century , but i belong much more to the 19th century , says balthasar klossowski , known to the world as the painter balthus as it happens , balthus was born on feb 29 , 1908 , a quirk of fate he likes to joke makes him 23 the poet rainer maria rilke once told him that being born on leap day was like slipping through a crack in time it gave balthus access to a kingdom independent of all the changes we undergo for years he has contrived to live in that kingdom , in life as in his archaizing art , divorced from his time in a realm of his own devising balthus has been described as one of the greatest living realist painters , but this is not altogether adequate , quality aside , because he is a realist of a singular and highly imaginary sort his portraits and figure studies , painstakingly and thickly painted , have a calculated naivete and a predilection for precisely drawn yet somehow mysterious imagery , full of oddities of scale and gesture his landscapes are dreamy , almost fairytale scenes bathed in a granular light , images of time in abeyance there s a geometry to the art that can be described as modernist , but in every way , balthus has tried to put distance between himself and the principal goingson in art of the 20th century at the moment , he sits in his sprawling 18thcentury chalet of pale wood and ponderous eaves , nestled in this tiny swiss mountain village in terms of artworld geography , in the middle of nowhere he and his wife , setsuko ideta , also a painter , have lived here for 20 years before that he lived in grand and conspicuously remote houses in france and italy almost proudly he makes a point of the fact that he has never been to the united states , not even for retrospectives over the years at the museum of modern art and the metropolitan in new york recently balthus agreed to meet for a few hours today he is dressed in a seaweedgreen japanese abbot s robe , short black boots over bright red socks , a gold chain around his neck thick glasses perch on his nose his gray hair is brushed straight back a chainsmoker , he keeps a cigarette in the corner of his mouth even when he talks you do n't smoke \? he asks at one point , then , with a dismissive arch of his eyebrows , answers himself no , of course not you 're an american setsuko , an alert , piquant woman in her early 50 s , wears a blue kimono with red sash , her lips bright red , her face white knowing his famed reluctance to say much about himself , i have taken along a book of paintings from the louvre many of the works that have influenced him , the ones he has echoed most often in his art , come from the louvre he went there countless times as a young man teaching himself to paint the louvre was the most instructive place for me , he says , and chiefly because i looked at poussin at 17 , balthus copied poussin s echo and narcissus in the louvre , and later he adapted the figure of the reclining narcissus in several paintings , as he has adapted other figures from other poussins , like the sleeping rinaldo from rinaldo and armida in therese dreaming , a languid image , mildly erotic , of a child rapturously dozing i taught myself to paint , and i went to the louvre to find how the great painters did it there i understood that if you do not have the means of telling something , you have nothing poussin came out of a time when art was a craft to make an art like the art of the 17th century , when poussin was alive , is impossible today because artists no longer know how it s done balthus has got on to a favorite subject , the decline of civilization you know , the human being was quite different in poussin s period , he says , a theory he has put forward before and the human being has completely changed , especially since the war before the war there was another kind of humanity , but i'm convinced that something has happened to mankind , something terrible , that mr hitler let something diabolic into the atmosphere there s no longer any culture , if you 've noticed at 88 , balthus is scythelike , a wraith last month he traveled to paris , but these days he needs help to cross a room he hears with difficulty , and his eyes are too weak to allow him to draw setsuko says she assists him in his studio , calling herself his studio boy always slow , he has exhibited only one new painting in the last few years , though he says he paints every day and is progressing on works for a retrospective in october at the accademia valentino in rome , where he lived in the 1960 s and early 70 s in the villa medici as head of the french academy you can see how he was handsome when he was younger though he speaks slowly , in a gravelly voice , he has lost none of his cunning , mischievousness or preening finesse a friend , the writer claude roy , has likened him to a cat brilliant , but in that very brilliance , roy observed , reserved , skittishly secret , courteously open yet hermetically closed indeed , balthus is evasive , in his gracious yet curmudgeonly way you may get the impression that his remarks everything about his extravagant persona , in fact are a little fantastical and to be taken with a grain of salt years ago he let it be known that being of noble birth , his rightful name was the count de rola , and he suggested , despite his german , russian and polish ancestry , a family connection between himself and byron we come from a very bloody clan , he says , and i think i detect fleeting amusement on setsuko s part
of all the descriptions that capture the vastness of the new york city public school system , perhaps none is as telling as this it took officials until noon yesterday , a full six months after the opening of school , to complete the count of every student enrolled for the year it is 1 , 056 , 251 , an increase of 23 , 109 over the previous school year that the board of education spends so much time on the tally much of it double and triplechecking the number shows its critical importance the enrollment number helps determine how much money the school system gets from the city and state at a high school with 2 , 000 students , an undercount of just 25 could mean a loss of 45 , 000 in aid enough to pay a teacher for the year the official enrollment number is actually a snapshot of how many students were in school last oct 31 officials say that is the date school attendance is at its peak \( and , therefore , yields the most aid \) some students begin dropping out in november and others graduate in january every year on oct 31 , the system s 1 , 100 schools play a huge game of musical chairs , stopping the turntable and counting the students in classrooms at that moment it would be much easier counting clutch plates at the general motors plant in tarrytown , said wayne trigg , the board official who oversees the census it s not just inventory control we 're tallying real people and real life is complicated this year , for the first time , most schools are linked to computers tracking attendance but instead of speeding up the count , the new technology slowed it down , as attendance secretaries , long accustomed to compiling records in oldfashioned , red roll books , struggled to learn the new electronic system and because of the temptation for schools to add phantom names to computer rolls to receive more money , as occasionally happens , board officials also compared those rolls to the individual , handwritten counts made and signed by all teachers on oct 31 as in the past , those tallies took a month or more to reach the board s fact checkers , pushing the counting into early december by then , officials at the board s headquarters in downtown brooklyn had an estimated enrollment which , as it turned out , was within 251 students of the final total then came spot audits for a quarter of the city s schools , some chosen at random and others because of discrepancies in their records with a day s warning , the schools were visited by monitors who audited the handwritten attendance books and computer records with the sobriety of the internal revenue service for beverly alexander , the principal of public school 29 in cobble hill , brooklyn , the day of reckoning came on a bonecold morning in late january when daniel carponcy , the chief auditor in the board s monitoring office , arrived with an armload of reports under his arm maureen , the principal bellowed to her attendance secretary , maureen monaco could you come through the door , and prepare to be boiled in oil ! over the next six hours , without a break , mr carponcy and his assistant , lucille attianese , retired to a fourthfloor office with attendance records from all 33 classes twentyseven for 304 , ms attianese said , reading from a record that showed 27 pupils in a thirdgrade class great , mr carponcy said grade 3 is on the money ! as in other schools , the population of ps 29 can be difficult to pin down many of the students , the principal said , are immigrants from the middle east and central america , and their parents sometimes register them in advance for the fall semester , take them back to their home country over the summer and return in midwinter , if at all in the end at ps 29 , mr carponcy determined that the school had accurately counted its enrollment 780 students , two more than last year but there was a problem with the computer records the enrollment number includes longterm absentees registered students who had not , as of oct 31 , attended a day of school these students are supposed to be highlighted so that the district does not receive financial aid for them mr carponcy discovered that the ps 29 computer records had not designated 10 of those students , which if not caught would have meant extra money for the school but the paper copy of the report was correct , so mr carponcy attributed the omission not to greed but to an innocent clerical error for ms alexander , the principal , the discrepancy raises a point for all the automation the computers bring , she told mr carponcy , we 're drowning in paper jean del buono , a secondgrade teacher , estimated that she spent an hour each week and an hour at the end of the month filling out three types of attendance sheets i think it s absurd it takes so long , she said while sympathetic , mr carponcy emphasized that the exercise was vital what we would like to do is get the burden down but have the reliability remain , he said by the middle of this month , those figures will have dollar values some districts , with fewer students than estimated , will be asked to return about 1 , 800 for each student who did not materialize others will benefit from higher numbers we have to be like the umpires in a game , calling it like we see it , mr carponcy said of his role in all this it s money we treat it very seriously we ca n't be wrong chart keeping track enrollment on the rebound shows the studentpopulation in new york city \( in the hundred thousands \) from 1970 through 1995 \( board of education \)
toronto , oct 22 was that next year s kentucky derby winner out there on the woodbine track early this morning , flying half a mile in 48 seconds four days before the breeders' cup juvenile \? his name is ordway and his trainer , david donk , a graduate of the woody stephens stable and a smoothfaced and forthright man of 36 , flew into toronto to watch his star colt run in the canadian mud then he flew back to new york to attend his wife s lemaze class preparing for an even more important event the birth of their first child sometime before the end of the year standing near ordway in stall 10 in the breeders' cup barn , donk considered the swings of fortune on the road to kentucky and said all 2yearolds can run fast i think this one can also run long and if he wins the florida derby in the spring , then i 'll know i have a derby horse donk knows that derby horses come and go when they 're 2 in the last few months alone , some exceptionally fast juveniles did come and go kelly kip , smoke glacken and traitor each won steppingstone races and were labeled as early favorites for the kentucky derby then along came ordway , running second to smoke glacken in the hopeful , outrunning traitor and smoke glacken in the champagne stakes , finishing first or second in all four of his starts now he s the favorite for the 1 million breeders' cup juvenile on saturday and , yes , for the derby next spring , and the other flashy colts are n't even here donk knows that history wo n't be on his side if his horse wins none of the 12 horses who won the breeders' cup juvenile at 2 went on to win the derby at 3 we just want to make sure we 're not no 13 , he said somebody s got to be the first he thinks ordway might have a chance because his sire was the speed horse salt lake and his dam was priceless countess , a daughter of britain s distance horse vaguely noble but he s not counting the roses yet you see speed in 2yearolds because it s one thing they can do run fast the races are short , and if an owner wants a speedball , the trainer can crank him up it depends on your goals ordway is a serene , dark bay colt with two white patches on his gentle face a nice horse , donk reported , but he likes some mischief , too you know , he s still a child donk probably acquired his patient manner naturally he was born in canandaigua in upstate new york , he grew up on a farm near the finger lakes track where his father raced some horses , he even trained as a blacksmith but the defining event of his career came in 1984 when he was hired to work in florida as an assistant to woody stephens , winner of two kentucky derbies and five straight belmont stakes he has been the biggest influence on me , donk said , and working for him has been my biggest break when stephens reduced his stable for health reasons in 1991 , donk went on his own as a trainer the first year , he won three stakes but he got a big horse last year when he acquired the turf runner awad , who worked half a mile in 492 5 on the grass this morning and will run in the 2 million breeders' cup turf meanwhile , ordway also made the scene last year he was a yearling who was bought for 80 , 000 in the september sale at keeneland by two new york investment brokers , philip dilio and william punk , who were neighbors when they were kids in brooklyn taking the subway to the track to root for dr fager , kelso and damascus ordway made his debut on july 18 at belmont , and has raced only four times , never worse than second he lost his first race by a neck , won the next time at saratoga despite heavy traffic , ran second to smoke glacken in the hopeful , then outran traitor in the champagne he generally stalks and strikes in the champagne , he made a move that sent a signal he was trapped behind horses in the homestretch when his jockey , john velazquez , timed a charge through a narrow opening , burst clear and went on to win the official description of the race read split rivals in deep stretch both velazquez and donk agreed that the boy grew up quickly with that move but he still has mountains to climb in the breeders' cup , he will be challenged by a full field of 13 colts with their dreams and ambitions , led by two stars from the d wayne lukas barn , boston harbor and gold tribute , and by george steinbrenner s acceptable and britain s falkenham we 'll find out , donk predicted as woody says , 'you win a few and lose a lot'
winter haven , fla , march 12 the sun returned to spring training , florida style , today , and mike hargrove , whose team lost two games to rain the previous day , was smiling again everything s fine , the cleveland manager said when asked about his camp , except we 're not catching the ball which is precisely the point ozzie guillen of the chicago white sox made last week when he was explaining why it would be possible for someone to knock off the indians this season their defense is n't that great , guillen said they have kenny and vizquel that s the only two guys who are really good he referred to center fielder kenny lofton and shortstop omar vizquel , who last season gained their third successive gold glove awards except for catcher sandy alomar jr , none of the other indians would be mistaken for an awardwinning fielder , but their defense did not deter the indians from gaining a major leaguehigh 100 victories last season except for making comments about how guillen is always making comments , the indians readily acknowledged their defensive shortcomings everybody knows this team needs a defense , alomar said we can hit , we can pitch if you 're going to point to something where we 're weak , it s our defense it s true added second baseman carlos baerga , when asked about guillen s assessment it s fair we realize that that s going to be one of the keys for us to win everything we have to improve our defense we know that but no one in the indians' camp thinks errors will accomplish what guillen and the white sox hope we 're not a real good defensive team and we 're not a real bad defensive team , hargrove said certainly if we do n't catch the ball enough , it will hurt us but we were able last year to score enough runs that we outscored our mistakes we 'd love to be able to lead the league in fielding , but you have to be realistic about the kind of club we are and how this club was built it was built with the idea of having people that could move the baseball and score runs the indians scored the most runs , hit the most home runs and gave up the fewest runs in the american league last season they were in the middle of the pack defensively baerga , with 19 , and third baseman jim thome , with 16 , led the team in errors in their first 11 exhibition games , the indians committed 20 errors this spring , a teamleading three each by baerga and thome before the indians played errorfree in their 12th game today , a 41 loss to the pittsburgh pirates , baerga and thome talked about the need for improvement the ones who have to improve are going to be myself and jim thome , baerga said his primary problem last season , he explained , was fielding routine grounders most of the errors were fielding , not throwing , he said i have to concentrate a little bit more on the easy ground balls i think i always make the hard plays thome said the indians have to concentrate on defensive fundamentals and win games by executing plays defensively we were fortunate to hit so many home runs last year , he said , but we ca n't rely on home runs to win all the time through home runs and other offensive means , the indians won 27 games in their last times atbat and while baerga and thome were making errors , they were contributing to the offensive onslaught in which 5 players hit more than 20 home runs , 6 drove in more than 70 runs and 7 members of the regular lineup hit 300 or better maybe i do n't have the talent that omar has to play defense , but i have the talent to hit , said baerga , who batted 314 and drove in 90 runs thome hit 314 , socked 25 homers and knocked in 73 runs hargrove will keep them if you talk about the total package , i 'll take our guys , the manager said i like the people we have continuing in their offensiveminded mode , the indians signed julio franco to play first base and let paul sorrento go sorrento hit 25 home runs last season , but he also helped thome and baerga by deftly digging throws out of the dirt franco has not shown a similar talent this spring and , in fact , has looked like he could be capable of making the defense even shakier i think franco is going to help us a lot in hitting , baerga said we 'll have to see about playing first base
though it will only be only an exhibition , men s tennis will return to madison square garden next month for the first time since 1989 pete sampras , ranked no 1 in the world , and three former no 1 players andre agassi , jim courier and john mcenroe will play in the nike cup on dec 20 to raise money for the tim and tom gullikson foundation to help patients who have brain cancer and their families tim gullikson coached sampras before dying of brain cancer on may 3 he was 44 it will be very emotional , said sampras , speaking by telephone from florida yesterday it s not easy time kind of heals everything , but it wo n't be the same without tim in my life none of the players are being paid for the exhibition organizers hope to raise 500 , 000
the second program presented by ballet ullate of madrid , which ended its debut season at city center yesterday , was obviously chosen for its spanish inspiration victor ullate , the company s director , choreographed both pieces on the bill jaleos , a plotless neoclassical work on toe that alluded to flamenco s conventions , and el amor brujo , in a new version set to manuel de falla s wellknown ballet score of the same name danced with polish by a wellschooled company , the program nonetheless said something about the difficulties that classical ballet has encountered in spain historically , ballet has been unable to compete with stronger , native traditions not only flamenco but also the complex and colorful spanish regional dances and the popular dancefilled operetta known as zarzuela royal patronage for ballet through the 19th century was also less continuous or enthusiastic than it was , for instance , in france , russia and denmark it is only in recent years that dancers with international experience like mr ullate have returned home to build up a contemporary ballet company from scratch it is a rare choreographer who can mix flamenco s grounded style with the less earthbound continuum of classical technique jaleos , which received its world premiere on wednesday night at city center , offered a superficial stylization of two idioms rather than incorporate national gesture into the classical idiom as balanchine could do , mr ullate offered a classroom ballet with occasional allusions to flamenco postures the more obvious inspiration was mr ullate s mentor , maurice bejart , in his ethnic mood bejart style , the men were barechested and turned a lot the women had fine attack in the repetitive choreography , and rut miro stood out in her power and presence luis delgado mixed the jaleos , or handclaps of flamenco , with whispers and melodies in his taped score mr delgado also added assorted surf and electronic sounds to the original score of el amor brujo , which mr ullate infuses with strong dramatic roles but extended to 95 minutes , this version has a tediousness that a compact presentation could have avoided the story , drawn from the 1915 original ballet , is none too clear here it helps to know in advance that candelas , the heroine , cannot consummate her love with carmelo until the spirit of her past lover is exorcised still , the choreography , danced in ballet slippers with an expressive use of gesture and a mobile torso , is solid enough for maria gimenez s perfectly nuanced performance as candelas jesus pastor s impressive technique made something of carmelo , and ms miro was the gypsy who introduced the famous fire dance as a whole , the production is as handsome and schematic as its sets by frederic amat photo jesus pastor and rut miro in the premiere of jaleos , by ballet ullate \( marilynn k yee the new york times \)
science on trial the clash of medical evidence and the law in the breast implant case by marcia angell , md 256 pages w w norton 2750 the two chief facts of marcia angell s sober and rigorous examination of the controversy over silicone breast implants can be simply stated one is that since about 1992 , a few highly skilled liability lawyers have succeeded in effecting a vast transfer of money from several corporations to themselves and their clients the claim they have made in courts , convincingly to juries , is that silicone breast implants have caused grievous diseases in women the second fact , which is at the heart of dr angell s retelling of this cautionary tale , is that there is no scientific evidence that silicone implants cause any diseases in women at all to put this another way , a kind of legal confiscation of several billion dollars has been engineered , with the sanction and approval of the american legal system , aided by a gullible news media and by a kind of rejection of science or at least that is the essential argument made by dr angell , who is a physician and the executive editor of the prestigious new england journal of medicine in the most remarkable case covered in detail by dr angell , a houston woman was awarded 25 million in compensatory and punitive damages by a jury in 1994 the woman , pamela johnson , said that silicone gel from her breast implants leaked into her body and induced an autoimmune disorder , in which she feels like she has a bad case of the flu all the time but as dr angell points out , ms johnson had apparently not been diagnosed as having any wellrecognized immune disorder or connective tissue disease , the latter a devastating illness with such symptoms as lupus , rheumatoid arthritis and scleroderma dr angell call ms johnson s medical situation nebulous , saying she had vague , nonspecific complaints , such as recurrent sinusitis , sore throats , colds and bladder infections the astronomical sums involved in her case left the implant manufacturers facing two bad alternatives to fight future cases in court with the risk of suffering more large transfers of cash or attempting to settle out of court the companies opted for the latter solution , setting aside 42 billion \( 1 billion of which was reserved for the lawyers \) in one of the largest classaction cases ever in going over this history , dr angell furnishes little information that has not already been reported in the press on the breast implants controversy indeed , her footnotes show her indebtedness to reporters , especially those at the new york times , who have covered all aspects of the implants controversy , from the absence of any scientific proof of plaintiff claims to the staggering amounts of money that lawyers and collaborating doctors have earned as they have brought or threatening to bring these cases to court what dr angell does in clear , meticulous fashion is provide an authoritative voice on the breast implant matter from within the scientific establishment along the way she puts together the entire story , beginning with the first breastenlargement operation \( in germany in 1895 \) and ending with an update on the status of the 42 billion settlement \( it is crumbling because of the largerthanexpected number of claimants \) dr agnell is not an exciting writer her book includes no courtroom drama , no inside glimpses of boardrooms , no interviews with plaintiffs \( or anybody else \) but her presentation is convincing and her conclusions well substantiated a combination of greed , mediasensationalism , judicial gullibility and the cleverness of lawyers triumphed so totally over science that we have to doubt society s commitment to such things as evidence and scientific logic dr angel begins with a quick summary of the silicone implants issue , arguing among other things that the system resulted in relatively small gains for many women and enormous gains for a few lawyers in simple , nontechnical language , she describes what silicone implants are and what problems women have encountered in using them she covers the food and drug administration s decision in 1992 to ban the implants , not because there was evidence that they were dangerous but because the manufacturers had not satisfied requests for information about their safety the unintended consequence of the fda s decision was the birth of an immensely profitable liability industry , which dr angell describes in some detail , giving the names of three supposedly expert witnesses who have persuaded juries that the silicone implants do cause connective tissue disease and other ailments some distinctly secondrate scientists testify in trial after trial and consult in case after case , sometimes even earning their living that way , dr angell writes their major talent , she adds , is convincing juries , not evaluating evidence dr angell does review the evidence , provided by several epidemiological studies none of the studies indicate any connection between the implants and connective tissue disorder still , as dr angell puts it , even before the studies , the courts had long since decided that implants cause connective tissue disease she asks given the absence of scientific evidence at the time , why were the courts so sure of their conclusions \? the answer has several parts , including , of course , the very nature of the adversarial system , whose object is not to ascertain the truth but to be victorious but dr angell cites a host of indications that science itself is being repudiated , not only by lawyers with a financial stake in repudiating it but by many others as well , from new age healers to feminists and multiculturalists whose more radical exponents see it as little more than the customs of a white men s club but dr angell writes , the question do breast implants cause disease \? can be answered only by science and by nothing else dr angell s book , dry though it is , is an important statement , not just about silicone implants but about other matters at the intersection of law , science and opinion her book is a plea for rationality and a warning that rationality , like much else in the fragile porcelain of society , can be weakened by a lack of vigilance photo marcia angell , md \( kimberly grant w w norton \)
at first glance , the hearing aid curtis pride wears in his left ear , his ability to flawlessly read lips , his speech that is impeded but far from impossible to understand tend to make what the parttime outfielder designated hitter has achieved appear somewhat less special than it really is these aids and abilities obscure at first the very real fact that pride , the onetime mets farmhand who now plays for the detroit tigers , is deaf the hearing aid allows pride to faintly hear a ringing phone , the droning of a loud conversation , the bass beat from a booming stereo but the player who was born with 95 percent hearing loss after his mother contracted rubella during pregnancy cannot hear the crack of the bat he could not hear the fiveminute standing ovation given him when as a montreal expo he made a tworun double his first major league hit in front of an admiring crowd in olympic stadium in 1993 none of that matters to pride people need their hearing for lots of things , but what do you need hearing for to play baseball to hear the crowd cheering you \? said pride , his winning smile and obvious delight in his accomplishments lighting up a gloomy afternoon at yankee stadium on friday but what about the old saw that an outfielder needs to hear the batter at the moment of contact to get a good jump on the ball \? he stopped short of calling it a myth that outfielders must hear the crack of the bat to play their position well , but pride , whom observers describe as an adequate outfielder , says he does not have to hear the crack to catch the ball he he also credits a sixth sense for his ability to track the ball as well as other outfielders still , what pride has achieved is special he is only the fifth nonhearing person to ever play in the majors and the first since 1945 he started off as a bench player for the expos he has become an emerging presence on the everevolving tigers , hitting 285 in the 62 games he has played , 307 in his last 52 games and playing almost daily since detroit cleaned house before the trading deadline at the end of july the tigers have asked their players to make but one adjustment for pride once he calls for a ball , no other outfielder can call him off other than that , tigers manager buddy bell has had no compunction about playing pride and is doing so more and more the reason is simple , says the former detroit first baseman cecil fielder he can play no doubt about it he has special gifts , special talents no matter how accomplished he may become , pride knows that , like jim abbott , who was born without a hand , his special circumstances will always attract as much attention as his onfield feats to me , i 've never looked at my deafness as a handicap , pride said i 've always thought of myself as one of the guys the only difference is i ca n't hear but i know that people see it as a great accomplishment , a person with disabilities who became a baseball player pride s message involves more than just play he has served as a special education guest lecturer at his former school in maryland as well as spokesman for the better hearing institute most important , he strives and achieves pride starred in not one but three sports while growing up in maryland he earned a basketball scholarship to william mary , where he earned a degree in finance his soccer abilities carried him even further when , at 17 , pride made the national 18andunder team that played in the 1985 world championships in china he tells me he s one of the 10 best soccer players in the world , fielder chortles then there is the man , a personable but fiercely proud and stubborn 27yearold who long ago learned to reject limitations suggested by those who wished for him a more cloistered world so , too , did pride s parents , john and salli they threatened legal action when he was told he could not play tball their support continued when curtis wanted to go into seventh grade at a neighborhood school attended by jackie , the oldest of his three sisters , rather than continue to travel many miles to a school with special classes for deaf children i always wanted to be independent , not to have a separate life that would make me feel helpless , pride said it was a challenge to see if i could manage in the hearing world on my own my parents agreed others in the pride family circle did not , telling him he was making a big mistake it turned out to be no mistake at all as pride started an uninterrupted march as an honor roll student , ultimately graduating with a 36 grade point average if he had not accepted the challenge , pride says , i would not be playing professional baseball it was the turning point of my entire life basketball , not baseball , took him through college , but the mets nonetheless drafted him in the 10th round of the june 1986 draft he played minor league ball while playing point guard and finishing college the minors proved to be more a test of pride s patience than his skills certain coaches were not convinced he could succeed and so , pride said , he often had to hit 50 , 100 points higher than other outfielders just in order to play by 1991 , pride was a florida state league allstar but by 1992 , his resolve was nearly spent he and his girlfriend had broken up he was hitting about 200 and playing infrequently and , amazingly , certain teammates in binghamton were getting their kicks by making fun of him \( some people will always be cruel , he said \) pride wanted to go home instead , salli and john pride , the homemaker and the federal government official who had never said no before , said no this time my father told me do n't quit , play out the season , then explore your options , pride said by the time the off season came , pride found even more inspiration while teaching english to disabled children at his old school a lot of these kids had so many problems emotional , physical , mental but they were all so great , pride said they said i inspired them , but they inspired me by september 1993 , pride , by then an expo , found himself standing on second base in the major leagues , feeling the vibrations of the ovation he could not hear after his first hit fueled a rally against philadelphia at first pride thought the cheers were for the expos' comeback then the third base coach walked onto the field he told me to take off my helmet and i thought there was something on top of it , pride said then he raised my arm and turned me around i was overwhelmed though pride enjoyed his moment in montreal , there were precious few others so he gladly left via free agency this winter because i thought , with a rebuilding team , i would get more playing time he has and now , pride said , flashing his smile again , i have my opportunity and i'm making the most of it photo people need their hearing for lots of things , but what do you need hearing for to play baseball \? says tigers outfielder curtis pride \(

at the very height of the french revolution , there was a wellknown actor called baptiste aine who dared to walk through paris with his hair still powdered white , after the fashion of the ancien regime no less audacious in those tumultuous years was the painter called jeanbaptiste greuze , who did not hesitate to be seen in paris in a scarlet coat , with a sword at his side quite clearly , the two men were made for each other , though baptiste aine enjoyed a lifelong success he was to play before napoleon more than 60 times whereas greuze had been reduced almost to beggary by the revolution , by changes in taste and by a particularly grueling and demeaning divorce they got together all the same , in 1793 , when greuze painted pastel portraits of both baptiste aine and his young wife the two images have an astonishing immediacy , and it is our good fortune that they have lately been acquired by the frick collection the frick , which is displaying them in an exhibition called greuze , a portraitist for the 90 s , has many masterpieces from the french 18th century , but none more seductive than these two they have a confidentiality that is irresistible baptiste aine was startlingly tall , and he would seem to have had a nasal tone of voice that served him better in comedy than in tragedy he excelled as count almaviva in beaumarchais s barber of seville and marriage of figaro , in which his imperious good looks were just right for the roles greuze makes us believe that when on the stage , he was projection personified but he also conveys the highstrung sensitivity that is called for in comedy at the highest level if this portrait came off so well , it was in part because greuze in his own way was also a man of the theater even from the titles of his paintings among them , the father s curse , the will revoked and the paralytic tended by his children we can tell that he was nature s melodramatist his paintings were prized as the equivalent of popular theater , and so were his engravings \( some of them even came with a printed explanation of the plot \) baptiste aine was not originally named simply baptiste his real name was jeanbaptiste anselme if he settled for baptiste , it was partly because baptiste at that time was a generic name for a performer who could make the audience laugh anyone who has seen the movie les enfants du paradis will remember how the audience on screen shouted baptiste ! baptiste ! when jeanlouis barrault came on as a mime this particular baptiste was not a street performer backstage in the comedie francaise , where he was a mainstay for more than 30 years , he had his portrait done twice \( by martin drolling and j b isabey \) but neither could equal the simplicity , the freshness and the informality of greuze s pastel on madame baptiste , greuze lavished the gift of intimacy that he had perfected throughout his long career hers is not a portrait done to formula the sitter is as if bemused by greuze s fullhearted response to her youth and her beauty as for the slight disarray of her costume , it is the epitome of what the goncourt brothers had to say about greuze in their french 18thcentury painters close to 150 years ago it is linen that seems to frolic with the very charms that it is assumed it hides a loose kind of attire , unresistant , unattached and ready to float to the floor at the first provocation the frick s purchase of the two portraits by greuze was made possible by funds recently bequeathed in memory of suzanne and denise falk as is well known , the frick has no budget for acquisitions and is often mistaken for a stationary collection in recent years , this has been disproved by the arrival of picture after picture that subtly readjusts the balance of the collection one was the portal of valenciennes by watteau , made possible by a bequest from arthemise redpat this is not a classic watteau , full of gallantry , fine manners and couture clothes it is a downtoearth portrait of the soldier s life in a provincial town when there is nothing much to do but wait around but it , too , speaks for the french 18th century another was the early corot of the arch of constantine and the forum in rome once again , this is out of step with the current taste in henry clay frick s lifetime it is not one of the silvery , elegiac landscapes that corot painted at mortefontaine and elsewhere in the 1860 s it is one of the offcentered marvels that corot painted in rome in the 1820 s corot at that time was working with a pictorial architecture of his own devising , and one that has never come to look conventional this painting was given to the frick by e v thaw , the collector and dealer , and his wife , clare , and , like the two pastels by greuze , it has a vibration all its own greuze , a portraitist for the 90 s remains at the frick collection , 1 east 70th street , manhattan , through april 14 the portraits of baptiste aine and his wife will remain at the frick and be integrated into the collection photos new acquisitions jeanbaptiste greuze s 1793 portraits ofbaptiste aine and his wife , at the frick \( photographs from the frick collection \)

the president of the yonkers branch of the national association for the advancement of colored people , who took over in november after the national leadership suspended his predecessor for questioning the value of busing , resigned yesterday to protest the national organization s decision to uphold the suspension the president , gene a capello , said in his resignation letter that affirming the suspension sends a chilling message that first amendment freespeech rights may be curtailed if they vary from accepted dogma mr capello called that so patently unfair that no rightthinking person can agree to be bound by such parameters mr capello succeeded kenneth w jenkins , who was suspended after he appeared at a news conference with mayor terence m zaleski and questioned whether busing was still an appropriate remedy for school segregation in yonkers mr jenkins , a 34yearold computer consultant who had held the unpaid post of chapter president for six years , said that courtordered busing had outlived its usefulness in yonkers because it had not guaranteed children a better education at the time , mr zaleski was in a tight race for reelection that he eventually lost there was no answer at naacp headquarters in baltimore last night william h penn sr , the director of branches for the naacp , said last week that mr jenkins had been suspended for breaking a rule barring the expression of views that conflict with the national organization s policies he was not suspended for his thoughts , mr penn said he was suspended for not carrying out the policies and procedures of the naacp mr penn said the national board had upheld mr jenkins s suspension after receiving a recommendation from a hearing panel that concluded mr jenkins had deliberately violated the policy , something he disputed mr capello s resignation came at the end of a threepage letter to kweisi mfume , the executive director of the national naacp mr capello took issue with the way he and mr jenkins learned of the suspension from a reporter seeking comment and complained that naacp officials had ignored their calls no national organization with the history and reputation of the naacp should conduct business this way , he said mr capello also said in the letter that the bergen county , nj , branch had taken virtually the same position that mr jenkins did , but that none of its officials had been suspended no leadership can function when every statement it makes or action it takes is subject to strict scrutiny by a national parent organization that may or may not treat others similarly situated in the same manner , mr capello said in the letter it is completely mystifying why mr jenkins has received such a severe penalty
washington , may 11 viewed purely in dollarsandcents terms , the sixyear plans to balance the federal budget unwrapped by president clinton in march and by the republican congress on wednesday have edged toward a compromise the trouble with this is that a compromise has long been unlikely , and is getting more so as the presidential campaign heats up the two budgets are political documents and in political terms , the gap between them remains yawning republicans want to cut taxes , even at the expense of domestic programs , and democrats want to spend on domestic programs , even at the expense of tax relief this has been true for decades , of course but the differences have been submerged in these electionyear budgets as each side tries to convince voters that it is relentlessly parsimonious and endlessly generous , all at the same time both sides have experienced fiscal epiphanies since they began battling over the path to a balanced budget a year ago , mr clinton planned to run 200 billionayear deficits indefinitely his latest budget would give voters a tax cut and still reach balance by the year 2002 , even under the more severe yardsticks that the congressional budget office uses to measure spending the republicans caromed into budgetwriting a year ago , pledging to cut taxes by 245 billion and slice more than a half trillion dollars from healthcare and welfare spending their latest budget still reaches balance while the tax cut and the savings in benefit programs have been virtually halved , albeit in six years instead of seven but both budgets must be marked with asterisks , for their true differences are greater than they seem tax cuts are the foremost example as the congressional budget office sees it mr clinton s own figures are more generous the white house proposes to give families 97 billion in tax breaks for children , education and other causes from fiscal 1997 to 2002 the republicans have scaled back their cuts to 122 billion , all devoted to a single 500perchild credit for families making less than 110 , 000 a year those figures are accurate , but not entirely true the president cuts taxes less than he redistributes them more than half the money comes from closing business loopholes , and much of the rest arguably comes from reimposing some excise taxes on the aviation industry and its passengers that expired last december even dismissing the aviation taxes , the actual reduction in the tax burden is only about 41 billion nor are the republican figures the entire story the 122 billion allotted in the budget for tax cuts is a net figure , and house leaders have said they will eventually cut an additional 60 billion or so in taxes on investors , businesses and individuals , largely by closing loopholes that raises the total tax cut to 180 billion , or roughly twice mr clinton s gross figure the added tax breaks were not plugged into the budget that was made public on wednesday , in part because there is as yet no clear way to pay them , and in part , no doubt , because the lower figure is a less attractive target for democrats accusing republicans of giving tax breaks to the rich spending cuts are another matter while the president s core budget reaches a balance in six years under the white house s economic assumptions , the congressional budget office has said that mr clinton will have to find another 81 bilion in savings or new money to reach a zero deficit , using its more conservative estimates so the president has set aside some budgetary plugins in case congress s projections prove right they include a sunset provision for the automatic termination of the final two years of his tax cut , worth 32 billion , as well as further cuts in domestic spending and selling off more of the broadcast spectrum robert o reischauer , who ran the congressional budget office under a democratic congress , calls the sunset provision the amazing disappearing tax cut , reflecting his skepticism that politicians would ever allow such a thing to happen he and others doubt that the white house can reap as much from selling pieces of the airwaves as it supposes the white house says its estimates were actually lower than those of the federal communications commission the white house is unapologetic from our economic assumptions , we do n't believe we need to sunset , a senior white house official said on friday , adding that mr clinton is firmly committed to suspending the tax cuts anyway , in the final year of what would be his second term , should the need arise democrats maintain that the republican proposal to reduce projected medicare spending , by 158 billion , is more onerous than the last congressional offer in january because much more of the savings would come from that part of the program that pays hospital expenses for retirees than before but republicans say that is only because they had to sacrifice savings from the other half of medicare , the insurance program that covers doctors' visits , when mr clinton made a political issue of lowering the premiums earlier this year democrats charge that the republicans' proposal to cut domestic spending , by some 53 billion less than their last offer in january , masks the fact that the latest cuts are crammed into six years instead of the previous seven republicans argue that the democratic cuts in domestic spending are largely pushed into the last two years of the budget plan , perhaps on the hope that they will never have to be made indeed , most calculations estimate that about 65 percent of the administration s domestic cuts would take place in the last two years , compared with about 59 percent of the cuts in congress s plan the white house reductions in welfare , medicare and other benefit programs also are more backloaded than those of the republicans , but only by a few percentage points none of this means that the budgets are dishonest it does mean that they have been crafted in ways that make democrats look more responsible than the bigspender image that republicans like to pin on them , and that make republicans look less aristocratic and contemptuous of the poor than democrats like to imagine that s the amazing thing about the federal budget , said a ranking congressional expert who spoke on the condition of anonymity you can make it do anything you want he was talking about the white house version but whether it applies to democrats , republicans or neither rests on whose assumptions one chooses to believe chart a comparison three balanced budget proposals compares thefollowing budgets republican , jan 1996 republican , may 1996 and clinton , april 1996

when raymond devoe , market strategist for legg mason wood walker , visited japan in 1989 , he heard the same story at least two dozen times everyone talked about how different japanese investors were , he recalled last week they were in for the long term , and nothing would be likely to make them sell their stock investments seven years later , the japanese stock market is down 40 percent , and the amount of money in the japanese version of mutual funds has fallen more than 90 percent instead of holding onto their stock funds , japanese investors have cashed out , even as the nikkei index rallied nearly 20 percent in the last year now , with billions of dollars flowing each month into american mutual funds , united states fund investors are being characterized as the japanese were several years ago americans will not flee their stock funds , the argument goes , because they know their historical performance and because they are investing for the long term as fresh evidence , some wall street analysts point to the most recent quarter , when cash poured in despite a downturn in stock prices in july but such a conclusion ignores several recent cases of investors' fleeing individual funds among them fidelity magellan , strong discovery and van wagoner emerging growth when performance did not live up to expectations in addition , investors in charles schwab company s mutual fund marketplace quickly pulled money out of funds in july when the market s long bull run appeared threatened a longer view , too , shows that american fund investors , like their japanese counterparts , have abandoned an entire asset class when performance lagged equity investors in the late 1970 s and government bond investors in the last two years have continued to sell even after those investments returned to decent returns to be sure , there is little in the performance of equity funds in the third quarter to give investors much reason to flee according to the fund trackers at morningstar inc , in chicago , the average united states stock fund gained 255 percent in the quarter and 125 percent in the first nine months of 1996 international funds , by contrast , lost an average of a half of a percent in the quarter , lowering the year s returns to 96 percent few on wall street expect the performance of the stock market to waver substantially the rest of the year , which means that fund companies are likely to continue to reap strong cash flows but there is plenty of evidence that a significant portion of the people now flocking to mutual funds are an untested , if not unstable , group according to the federal reserve s quarterly flow of funds report , released last month , mutual funds held 125 trillion of equities at the end of june , up from 233 billion at the end of 1990 that means 80 percent of the money now invested in stock funds was not there during any significant downturn like the crash of 1987 that s really kind of mindboggling , said melissa brown , quantitative analyst at prudential securities most of the money invested in mutual funds has not gone through a bear market , so we really do n't have a historical framework to determine whether individuals will stay put if we see a prolonged correction in the market my guess is that they wo n't that they will be much more likely to pull their money out than the common wisdom would suggest david kim says he will not be one headed for the exits a 30yearold investor who makes his living reading scripts for movie studios in los angeles , mr kim made his first stock fund investments in july , moving about 7 , 000 from a schwab money market account into three funds looking at how his funds have performed so far , as well as at their oneyear performance , mr kim wants to invest more , particularly in stein roe capital opportunities , which has gained 496 percent in the last 12 months he plans to do so by taking a cash advance of 1 , 500 on a credit card and using it to buy more fund shares once he has the money in hand , mr kim plans to transfer his card balance to a new credit card , which offers a low introductory interest rate of 59 percent for the first year after a year , when the introductory rate expires , he intends to cash out of the fund or , if possible , roll over the loan to another card with a low rate mr kim said he recognized that he could lose money , but the risk does not bother him i think that given the general upward trend of the market , the idea makes sense , he said i will give it three to six months , and if the fund is consistently going down over that time , i will cash out and pay off the principal thus , while he thinks the longterm prospects for stocks remain bright , mr kim might jump in and out of the market at times certainly , mr kim does not fit the profile of the average mutual fund investor as compiled by the investment company institute , a fund trade group in july , the institute reported that , based on a random survey of 1 , 165 households , the average fund investor is middle class , 44 years old , has financial assets of 50 , 000 and bought his first fund shares before 1990 none of which would suggest that fund companies need to worry about the willingness of shareholders to move in and out of positions
new delhi , friday , may 10 the congress party , which has governed india for all but four years since independence in 1947 , suffered a devastating rout in the general election , substantial returns showed today prime minister p v narasimha rao announced that he would resign as government leader after a cabinet meeting this afternoon officials say he would then probably remain in office for a few days as a caretaker while parties scramble to shape a new coalition and pick its leader while no final election result is expected before late today , computer projections based on about twothirds of more than 350 million votes cast left all the major parties far short of a majority in the 545seat lower house of parliament the congress party , while reduced to half the seats it held in the old parliament , may still be a partner in the new government , though not necessarily its leader the coalition negotiations are likely to center on efforts to exclude from the new government the party that seems likely to finish with the largest number of parliamentary seats , the rightwing hindu nationalist bharatiya janata party while split on issues like caste and economic policy , almost all the other parties vigorously oppose the hindu party s hardline policies on hindumuslim relations , regarding them as a threat to india s social harmony the election result was a humiliation for mr rao , the 74yearold political veteran who was a surprise choice for congress party leader after the assassination of rajiv gandhi during the last election , in 1991 once in office , in another suprise , mr rao set out to scrap india s decadesold socialist economic system crippled by a corruption scandal that broke as this election approached , mr rao went to india s president , shankar dayal sharma on thursday night , and said he would formally resign that set the stage for intense maneuvering on the formation of a coalition to be drawn from some combination of the three main contenders in the election the congress party , the bharatiya janata party , and a coalition of centrist , leftist and regional parties known as the national frontleft front alliance according to computer projections , each of the three groups finished with a quarter to a third of the seats , making for the most fragmented parliament in india s halfcentury of independence the projections , drawn from returns in more than 460 of the parliamentary districts , showed the congress party , winner of 8 of 10 previous elections , slumping to about 140 seats , more than 100 seats fewer than it had the returns showed the congress party winning about 32 percent of the vote nationwide , nearly 3 percentage points below its showing in the 1977 election that vote ousted a congress party government after a bitterly unpopular nationwide emergency declared by prime minister indira gandhi the hindu nationalists' gains , at least 50 seats more than the 120 the party won in 1991 , came despite the party s failure to boost its share of the national vote above the 20 percent it won in the previous election results showed that the bharatiya janata party and its smaller ally , shiv sena , owed their gains to the concentration of their support in a handful of populous northern states where the only party that might have challenged them , the congress party , was in decline , and where smaller parties canceled each other out in their fight for the votes of the lowercaste majority although the computer projections showed the bharatiya janata party as likely to finish with the largest bloc , about 180 of parliament s 545 seats , hostility toward the party s hardline policies among almost all other parties appeared to make a coalition between the congress party and the national frontleft front alliance far more likely one senior alliance leader , h d deve gowda , who heads the government of karnataka state , said the hindu nationalists' chances of winning allies for a coalition ended when it encouraged a hindu mob three years ago to destroy india s oldest muslim shrine , at ayodhya in uttar pradesh state , setting off riots across india in which thousands of muslims died after december 1992 , any question of coming closer to the bjp is ruled out , mr gowda said with the computer projections indicating a tally of 140 to 150 seats for the alliance , and about 70 seats for splinter parties , a coalition between congress and the alliance would be likely to exceed the 273 seats needed for a majority in parliament but even before formal talks between the two groups had begun , feuding broke out over the shape of a coalition , and over who might lead it it appears likely that there will be at least several days of infighting before a new government can take office even then , past experience with similar governments that took office after congress party election defeats , in 1977 and 1989 , have left many indians convinced that a new coalition will quickly succumb to factionalism , forcing a new election as early as next year one casualty of the uncertainty is likely to be the program of marketbased economic reforms , stalled for months by mr rao s concern that they would hurt the congress party among poor voters the reforms are now likely to become a political football as partners in a coalition government jockey for position before the next election
when a former astronaut writes science fiction , you have every reason to expect that it will champion the benefits of space travel against the doubters and penny pinchers in the scientific and political establishment encounter with tiber \( aspect warner , 2195 \) , by buzz aldrin and john barnes , delivers the goods , and then some mr aldrin , the second man on the moon , has clearly lost none of his zest for launchings and landings , orbital insertions , aerocaptures , gravity assists and similar maneuvers necessary for getting a spaceship safely from here to there his enthusiasm has led him , in collaboration with the author of novels like kaleidoscope century and mother of storms , to concoct a 560page novel of the near future with a simple premise space holds the answer to all our problems to make this point , the authors weave together two tales of interplanetary adventure the first focuses on chris terence and his son , jason , a dynasty of clearheaded astronauts with a knack for being in the right place at the right time chris helps save the united states' faltering space program from budgetminded politicians just in time to fly to the moon to retrieve a newly discovered alien artifact of incalculable importance when his mission fails , the torch is passed to jason , who joins an expedition to recover the artifact s twin on mars the journeys of the terences and their colleagues are described in a prose dense with technical details and augmented with textbookstyle diagrams it quickly becomes apparent that the authors expect you not only to read through paragraph after paragraph about lagrange libration points and marsearth return cycles , but to comprehend the information and apply it to the unfolding plot almost as an aside , the authors note that the worldwide mobilization required to support a really serious space program has virtually eliminated crime and ushered in an unprecedented era of peace and prosperity the second story centers on the aliens who deposited the artifacts in our solar system some 9 , 000 years ago although they have more hair and more advanced science , these spacefarers closely resemble earthlings in one important respect their clearheaded astronauts are also bedeviled by political and military types whose incomprehension of the principles of physics and engineering brings disaster after disaster not least of which is the stranding of aliens on earth in a manner that may have given rise to certain curious details in the hebrew bible the aliens' motive for venturing into space is simple enough their home world is about to be destroyed in a collision with a huge cloud of rocks , dust , balls of ice and all sorts of junk known as the intruder although earth is also vulnerable to devastating encounters with space debris , the authors refrain from adding this argument to their brief for a vigorous space program perhaps to encourage readers to make the connection on their own , all the characters , human and alien , male and female , communicate in virtually identical technospeak when one alien asserts that the best way to cope with a disaster is to get every gadget that we can working , he earns this supreme accolade from his boss spoken like an engineer for years now , male science fiction writers have been turning out futuristic tales of wish fulfillment in which traditional male virtues like guts , gumption and gunslinging triumph over the forces of evil in the universe gibbon s decline and fall \( spectra bantam , 2295 \) , by sheri s tepper , is part of the feminist backlash to this simplistic subgenre in ms tepper s universe , all evil is male the plucky women who band together to save the earth from a fate worse than death as the millennium approaches are an ordinaryseeming bunch except for sophy sophy is preternaturally beautiful , irresistibly charismatic and reticent to the point of obfuscation about her origins when she disappears , her former college classmates are at loose ends when she begins appearing to them in dreams or visions or hallucinations , they sense her true power and when the battle between good and evil is joined , guess who shows up to make humanity s day \? years ago , ms tepper published a memorable novel , grass , which laid bare the limitations of macho posturing by testing it against the challenge of a different planetary environment the human characters in that book , for all their personal flaws , drew on apparently inexhaustible reservoirs of strength and faith to survive inhumanly brutal suffering for all its eschatological rigmarole , gibbon s decline and fall seems lifeless , almost nerveless since suffering is equated with the passions and appetites that make us human , salvation can only come from without via miraculous intervention by the goddess that men overthrew at the beginning of history perhaps it s my incorrigible maleness , but this strikes me as a counsel of despair reclamation \( aspect warner , paper , 599 \) , by sarah zettel , is a first novel that , according to a cover blurb , belongs in the grand tradition of heinlein and asimov and so it does what ms zettel offers is a fresh updating of a familiar premise in a galaxy filled with humancolonized planets , no one remembers where humanity started from several powerful groups , all working at crosspurposes , are seeking the legendary home ground caught in the middle are eric and arla , two refugees from a backwater planet known to its slowwitted inhabitants as the realm of the nameless powers only the most slowwitted will have trouble guessing early on that the realm and the home ground are one and the same but instead of ending the story with this unsurprising revelation , ms zettel digs deeper into the personal traumas of eric and arla , exploring the connections between their lives and humanity s collective amnesia about its origins she knows that the grandest images emerge from a progression of wellchosen details from darkness to darkness stretched more of the ancestors' veins avir knew they must be enormous , but the cavern around them made them look like silken threads they crossed each other and spread out again at every angle it was a geometrician s dream it was the work of a thousand spiders over a thousand years the ruby light flashed down the threads like bottled lightning ms zettel s confident treatment of her ambitious material shows just how entertaining the grand tradition of heinlein and asimov can still be in sympathetic hands
under the facade of a handsome tudor building , across a wide expanse of lawn flecked with the yellows and reds of fallen leaves , a group of young men enjoy some time away from their books as they practice kicking , dribbling and shooting soccer balls into a net a familiar autumnal image of a connecticut campus , perhaps , yet one that would have been unimaginable only a few years ago in the 1980 s , st basil college in stamford had the smallest student body of any college in the state enrollments consisted at times of only a halfdozen students there was even a year when the entire graduating class could be counted on one finger back then , the threat of losing state accreditation seemed very real forget soccer this college s students would have had a hard time getting up a doubles match yet st basil kept operating , because it had to it was the only seminary for ukrainian catholic priests in the united states the fact that their branch of catholicism , with byzantine rather than roman roots , was being suppressed in its homeland by a communist government gave the college something to live for nevertheless , it appeared st basil might soon close , as had many other catholic seminaries in recent years today st basil college has more students than it has seen in years 51 , and expected to rise steadily in the years to come by 1999 , if all goes according to plan , the college will have a hundred students for the first time ever the reason is one of the most ambitious foreign study programs at an american college nearly all of st basil s student population is from ukraine they are united by what they call a common goal to become priests back home in a land where such a calling was banned by law only a few years ago the program is described by its administrators as a classic case of christian reciprocity a native church that sent priests to america in the late 1800 s to minister to ukrainian immigrants is now receiving help from the descendants of those it once looked after it was time to give a gift back , a hundred years later , said msgr john terlecky , vice chairman of the school s board of trustees the program began in the fall of 1994 st basil s rector , the rev edward p young said there is a severe need for seminaries to educate the crop of wouldbepriests in ukraine that emerged with the collapse of the soviet union enrollment is overflowing , he said of the situation there seminaries are stuffed to the gills there is no room monsignor terlecky , who journeyed to ukraine immediately after the fall of the soviet union , recalled newly created seminaries there with more than 300 beginning students and no program to speak of here we were , who had prayed for years for the lord of the harvest to send laborers into the harvest , he said now they were showing up , and we had no place to put them in contrast , st basil college was a seminary with a program but no students established in 1939 when growing turmoil in ukraine made the education of american priests there less feasible , st basil is on the former campus of a girls' boarding school , glen eden academy , which had closed during the depression enrollment had begun to decline in the late 1960 s , and by the 1980 s was down to a trickle as the soviet union faltered , bishop basil h losten had kept the seminary s state certification active during a threeyear period when it no longer offered a full college program , only housing and some specialized courses in ukrainian catholicism bishop losten one of four ukrainian catholic diocesan bishops in the united states whose parish of new england and new york state includes st basil said he did this with an eye toward the changes in the east when communism fell , those kids in the ukraine were going to need a place to study , he said since the motherland had helped us in times of immigration , i thought we could reciprocate in some way while the students will have to return to ukraine for four more years of studies before completing their training , bishop losten said at st basil they get a core understanding of humanities and philosophy unavailable in their homeland , as well as a firsthand view of the west over there , you learn what they tell you to learn , bishop losten said you 're not expected to learn for yourself it s still a communistic system here , they learn to think and make decisions it is a stark contrast from the life they knew only a short time before sister sheila campbell , a roman catholic nun who teaches english to firstyear arrivals , recalled meeting her first ukrainian class in 1994 when i walked in the door , they jumped up and stood at their desks , she said i nearly died the students , most of them still in their late teens , spend their first year completely immersed in learning english before beginning a fouryear liberal arts college program courses include biology and psychology as well as greek and latin english , not ukrainian , is the main language spoken there is even a new computer center on campus
velji do , croatia , april 3 croatian special police officers wrapped in green army ponchos , their faces averted from withering sheets of rain , labored up the steep slope of st john mountain tonight in a huge search for the farflung wreckage that had been the plane carrying secretary of commerce ronald h brown and 32 others debris and bodies were scattered down a dark , wooded hillside lit by the bobbing flashlights of the search teams and occasional , startling flashes of lightning blasts of thunder rolled out over the rocky , razorbacked precipices that rise and fall in profusion along the adriatic coast the heavy rain , which had turned the dirt roads to mud , reduced visibility to a few feet and soldiers said even walking to the remote site was difficult two croatian commanders of the operation , standing next to a stone hut , their hair matted down by the rain and their boots covered with mud , said they had found nine bodies and , to their astonishment , a surviving but unconscious woman but the woman died as rescuers tried to get her to a hospital in dubrovnik none of the passengers found had been identified by late tonight , and except for the woman , all were left to be recovered in the morning the heavy rain , fog and poor visibility made the use of helicopters impossible , the commanders said we have sent as many men , as fast as we could , into the area , one said we will do the best we can , but the terrain is very , very difficult the rain makes it hard for us to maneuver we have 100 men now , another 100 are on the way our men will look all night we all pray to god that some survived as he spoke , in the valley below , a convoy of six military trucks led by an army jeep with a flashing yellow light made its way up the steep road the officers in charge said the wreckage of the 737 military jet was strewn over a wide area near this tiny collection of stone huts about 20 miles by road east of the ancient walled city of dubrovnik they said that the bodies they had recovered , along with the woman , came from the fuselage of the plane , which had broken into two sections this is a terrible , terrible tragedy , said one soldier as he came down from the mountain the gray stone houses near the steeply wooded tract where the plane went down look out over cilipi airport , about two miles to the north the hazy white lights of its single runway were barely visible in the distance croatian officials said it appeared that the plane had been coming in low over the hills when it turned sharply , perhaps to loop back to the airport , and struck the side of the 2 , 400foottall mountain this is the way they would have come in for the approach , said one croatian officer we do not know what happened , but the plane may have been too low , been coming down the wrong valley and then turned , as it would in the normal approach to the airport , only to slam into st john mountain it was impossible for the pilot to see very much the last communication from the plane to the cilipi airport , where the croatian prime minister , zlatko matasa , and the american ambassador to croatia , peter w galbraith , awaited mr brown s arrival , was at 2 50 pm , american officials here said they said that they did not receive any distress calls and that the communication with the aircraft was normal prime minister matasa told me the plane had disappeared from the radar at around 3 20 , the ambassador said he said it was very serious when the plane failed to arrive , croatian helicopters and gunboats were dispatched along the jagged adriatic coast and surrounding islands , and initial reports suggested wrongly that the plane had crashed into the sea but about five hours later croatian special forces , who had fanned out in the hillsides north of the airport , sighted pieces of the plane and sent troops in by truck and jeep to begin the search the croatians began the search and rescue operation almost immediately , ambassador galbraith said the level of cooperation and support has been extraordinary for a long time we thought the plane had gone down in the water , until we got word that pieces had been found on the mountain american officials said that medics and troops from the natoled peacekeeping force in the balkans arrived at dubrovnik airport this evening to help in the operation ambassador galbraith , accompanied by the prime minister , visited the site late this evening but halted about an hour s walk from where the central pieces of wreckage lay the two men were to have played host to the secretary for a speech in the rector s palace this afternoon the problem is that there are no roads up through here , a croatian officer told the ambassador the brush is thick and we cannot see there is little we can accomplish tonight you had better try and come back tomorrow the ambassador , whose black suit was flecked with mud and whose black loafers were drenched , said , at this point , we will only get in the way photo the body of a woman being removed from the site of the 737 crashnear dubrovnik , croatia , yesterday search and rescue at the site was hampered by driving rain , and

moscow , may 6 yuri d maslyukov took another puff from his cigarette and smiled about his recent meeting with a senior official from the international monetary fund it was like people from the hawaiian islands trying to talk to eskimos , chuckled mr maslyukov , who is a top adviser to the communist candidate for president of russia , gennadi a zyuganov , and is also the chairman of parliament s committee for economic policy with the election just a month away , mr zyuganov has painted his economic program in generalities and platitudes to avoid unsettling noncommunist voters but a communist brain trust is beginning to assemble and while communist economists have yet to produce a master plan , they have deepseated assumptions about how to redirect the economy away from president boris n yeltsin s reform path and toward greater state control they disdain the international monetary fund and its tough demands that russia limit the printing of money and lower barriers to free trade in a reflection of their marxist training , they see stimulating industrial and agricultural production as a cure for russia s economic problems , even though western economists warn that this would mean propping up inefficient enterprises they argue that russia s history , its blend of european and asian cultures and even its climate make it an exception to the normal laws of economics the specialists are an unusual group mr maslyukov , the former head of the soviet union s state planning agency , gosplan , and a military industrial planning committee , is a key player the team also includes a former economics professor from the rostov railroad transport engineers institute , and an ethnologist who argues that russia should follow india s 1969 plan to nationalize leading banks another prominent communist in the group is a nightclub owner and banker who aspires to be russia s next economics minister the communists have also begun to draw on gorbachevera economic advisers and academicians who have been languishing in moscow s research institutes seeking to reassure russian and western business executives , the communists insist that they will support a mixed economy of private and governmentcontrolled enterprises if they win the election everyone expects us to wave sabers left and right , said igor m bratishchev , the former rostov professor and a member of parliament who is running a policy planning team for mr zyuganov we will not make impulsive moves but critics assert that the communists do not speak the language of modern economics and that their inexperience , as much as their ideological commitments , will lead them down the path to an inefficient and rigidly administered command economy none of them knows how the modern economy works , said vladimir mau , an economist with an economic institute headed by former prime minister yegor t gaidar , a supporter of president boris n yeltsin they want to make the economy oldstyle so that they will know how to deal with it imf a target of communist ire in trying to hammer out an economic plan , the communists are more clear about what they are against than what they are for for many , the international monetary fund has become a symbol of heavyhanded western intervention that has made life harder with the strong encouragement of the fund , the yeltsin government has restricted the money supply , lowered tariffs and carried out freemarket reforms the monthly rate of inflation has fallen from 18 percent in january 1995 to less than 3 percent and the monetary fund recently approved a 101 billion loan , which will help russia pay back wages and finance much of its budget deficit but the russian election is also taking place before the spurt of economic growth projected by the fund unemployment has increased privatization of governmentowned enterprises has been tainted by reports of favoritism and corruption while mr yeltsin has boasted of his ability to obtain loans from the fund , the communists have sought to convert the president s close association with the fund and its western leaders into a political liability peering over the piles of papers in his office in parliament , mr bratishchev said that russia might need the fund s money in the short term , but that the fund s longterm reforms were incompatible with russia s unique economic and political culture russia , he argues , is not receptive to major land reform and other extensive freemarket measures because it is a mixture of european and asian cultures and has a collective heritage and a harsh climate russia is the most northern civilization , and we have to act quite cautiously in our conditions , he said this is not being taken into consideration by the imf we should not be evaluated by commonly accepted measures oldschool marxists accorded respect dislike for the monetary fund among the communist rank and file has been reinforced by oldschool academicians at the russian academy of sciences like leonid abalkin a former top aide to mikhail s gorbachev , mr abalkin insists that he is not taking sides in the election but the academicians are spoken of in almost almost reverential terms by the communists in an interview , mr abalkin complained that russia is losing its independence to carry out its internal economic policy its policy is not being decided by parliament , but by the imf , he said by way of example , mr abalkin said that one important move supported by the fund , the elimination of tariffs on oil and gas exports , was wrongheaded
it is six years since he left city hall , but edward i koch still looms as a sort of eminence grise or at least the elder noodge of new york city politics politicians go to him for advice and consent he holds forth on his own radio show and writes a weekly political column in the new york post he hawks health plans in subway ads he reviews movies in five local papers last fall he even published a novel featuring , well , ed koch , as a murdersolving mayor for life but can the former mayor for 12 years decide an election \? that is the question in city hall now that mr koch has declared that he will not endorse mayor rudolph w giuliani for reelection , even though he heartily embraced him in 1993 and , according to conventional wisdom , helped him in no small way beat david n dinkins mr koch demurs and mr giuliani dismisses the question , saying he is not even thinking about a reelection campaign but political strategists on both sides of the coin agree that mr koch s unendorsement could haunt mr giuliani mr koch , who not only held the mayor s office but dominated the city s political zeitgeist through the 1980 s , could hurt mr giuliani with crucial swing voters , exposing the republican mayor s fundamental weakness in an overwhelmingly democratic electorate what s more , they say , he could bolster the credibility and the confidence of any number of potential challengers in 1997 even if it is too early to calculate mr koch s sway in an election nearly two years away , strategists say it is impossible to underestimate the damage mr koch could do after all , he takes to the airwaves five days a week , including right after the mayor s own weekly radio show on wabcam each friday morning it certainly does n't help , and it could hurt tremendously , said jay severin , a republican political consultant and radio host , who called the feud mr giuliani s worst strategic mistake so far ed koch s enmity is something the mayor can ill afford the imbroglio began when mr koch accused the mayor of meddling in the selection of judges after mr giuliani demoted two littleknown criminal court judges after a mayoral screening panel had recommended them for reappointment mr koch and others consider his creation of an independent panel to appoint and reappoint judges one of the legacies of his mayoralty when mr koch aired his criticisms , even holding a joint news conference with his erstwhile rival mr dinkins , mr giuliani fired back he accused the two former mayors of the height of hypocrisy , saying their records of achievements paled in comparison with his and he accused mr koch of having been beholden to the party bosses mr giuliani had once pursued as a federal prosecutor that guaranteed the break in an alliance that began with mr koch s crossparty endorsement in 1993 and that continued for the most part through the first two years of mr giuliani s term mr koch says he has supported 80 percent of what the mayor has accomplished , from fighting crime to controlling spending , but cannot condone mr giuliani s changes in judicial selection , which , he said , takes us back to the jungle of political influence on the courts in hindsight , mr koch said , the vehemence of the mayor s reactions confirmed for him a pattern of behavior evident in controversies over everything from the ouster of yasir arafat , chairman of the palestine liberation organization , from a concert at lincoln center to the tenure of former schools chancellor ramon c cortines everybody who does n't agree with him is either incompetent or corrupt , mr koch said that s his way of life and it s wrong it is exactly that kind of criticism that political strategists say could hurt mr giuliani the mayor , who narrowly edged out mr dinkins by building a coalition of republicans and disenfranchised democrats , particularly white , ethnic new yorkers in middleclass neighborhoods , is already slumping in the polls and , the strategists note that mr koch could confirm voters' doubts they 're the swing voters , and they can be brought back to the democratic party , said ester r fuchs , the director of the barnardcolumbia center for urban policy , who served as an adviser to mr dinkins in the 1993 campaign mr koch , she said , can legitimize a democratic candidate in the way he legitimized rudy giuliani in the last election or as norman alder , a democratic political consultant , put it , ed koch still has some political coin of the realm in new york city , and the right politician can cash in on that in a television interview , mr koch offered a list of six democrats he would support in 1997 district attorney richard a brown of queens , public advocate mark j green , city comptroller alan g hevesi , state comptroller h carl mccall , rep charles e schumer of brooklyn and city council speaker peter f vallone with the possible exception of mr green , none of these are now considered probable mayoral candidates , and mr koch specifically excluded the two democrats already giving the clearest signals they will run borough president ruth w messinger of manhattan and borough president fernando ferrer of the bronx \( mr koch said that ms messinger met with him this fall and he told her , i think of you as a young bella abzug when she protested , he replied that everyone he knew agreed with him she said , 'that s because you tell them i am , ' mr koch said ms messinger confirmed the exchange generally , rolling her eyes , and then declined to comment on mr koch s preferred list \) mr koch later acknowledged that he would not not rule out supporting other candidates , including geraldine a ferraro , who has been mentioned , although she has said she is not considering running listen , he said , if she s capable of running for vice president , she s capable of running the city lisa linden , a political public relations consultant who has often represented republicans , said mr koch s refusal to endorse mr giuliani could have as great an effect on the democratic primary as on the election , luring in other challengers that might have otherwise sat it out this is likely to have a real impact , she said most people influenced by ed koch are natural giuliani supporters raymond d harding , the leader of the liberal party and perhaps mr giuliani s strongest party supporter , said that in 1993 , mr koch s endorsement had absolutely helped , lending a democratic imprimatur to mr giuliani s fusion candidacy exit polls , he said , showed that mr koch had helped the mayor in general and with jewish voters in particular , as well as with surprisingly , he said , the irish mr harding said he was not one of those who depreciates the importance of ed koch , noting his significant platform on the radio , not to mention his penchant for what journalists call a good quote on just about any issue but he declined to predict the future first of all , words spoken in the winter of '95 are not the same as actions taken in '97 , mr harding said those of us who play politics in the long range do n't necessarily gyrate in the artillery that s been falling in the last week chart photo koch on giuliani then , october 1993 rudy giuliani will preside over an efficient , technocratic government dedicated to delivering service and above all setting a single standard for all citizens mr koch , in endorsing rudolph w giuliani for mayor and now , december 1995 he makes it totally personal if you disagree with him , he s going to be like torquemada i'm aghast at his ferocity and his willingness to say things that are untrue mr koch , saying he could not again endorse mr giuliani after a dispute over screening judicial appointees photo of former mayor edward i koch \( pg 24 \)
trenton , june 28 with two powerful casino heads pulling in opposite directions , the whitman administration has taken tentative steps this week toward calling the bluff of one of them , steven a wynn , who has threatened to cancel plans for a 2 billion casino and resort unless the state builds a road to his property perhaps because the decisions are not final , donald j trump , the other mogul , tried to appear not to gloat his spokesman even called an alternative plan , outlined in the past few days by the state transportation commissioner , frank wilson , a very fair plan mr wilson had been expected to make a recommendation to the governor today , but he requested a delay until early next week , the governor s chief spokesman , carl golden , said mrs whitman will make a final decision a day or two after she receives the commissioner s recommendation this is such an important issue , mr golden said we do n't want to move too fast mr wynn , the chairman of mirage resorts in las vegas , wanted the state to pay for a 329 million road and tunnel that would run from the atlantic city expressway alongside a canal to his property the proposals outlined by mr wilson , people familiar with them said , called for a privately financed road without a tunnel that would offer access to other casino properties along the boardwalk as well as to mr wynn s proposed casino the wynn development would be the largest ever in atlantic city , with 7 , 000 hotel rooms , four new casinos and as many as 20 , 000 jobs mr wynn s ultimatum left mrs whitman with one of the biggest economic development decisions of her tenure the governor , however , has historically shied away from subsidizing private development projects , and knows as well as anyone else in the state that in the months since mr wynn first made his proposal , atlantic city has become a magnet for casino development the arguments for a subsidized tunnel carry a lot less weight now within the past few weeks some of the biggest companies in the industry have come in here with no strings attached , said marvin roffman , a philadelphiabased gambling industry analyst asking taxpayers to provide large incentives to mr wynn while other developers are rapidly moving into atlantic city s thriving casino market without public subsidies would be illadvised , he said itt corporation , owners of caesars palace casinos , said this week that it would spend about 490 million expanding its atlantic city operations , and hilton hotels recently agreed to spend 3 billion for bally entertainment , which includes significant casino holdings in the city mr roffman noted that the city has already given mr wynn a 168acre piece of land known as the h tract , on which to build the casino resort if steve wynn turns this down and decides not to come to atlantic city , he said , within 45 minutes , someone else will come there and take that h tract lobbyists representing mr wynn in trenton refused to discuss the governor s impending decision , but mirage officials did confirm that they had been involved in talks with the transportation commissioner last week , mirage executives were still insisting that they would cancel their project without the statefinanced tunnel and roadway , but by this afternoon they seemed to be tempering their position when asked if mr wynn would walk away if his demands are not met , a mirage spokesman , alan feldman , said there has to be a transportation solution to traffic problems that have plagued that area it s up to the governor to make a decision mr wilson , the transportation commissioner , would not comment on his impending recommendation to the governor opponents of mr wynn s proposal have asserted that it would divert traffic from other casinos along the boardwalk , funneling customers directly into the mirage development mr trump has lobbied heavily against the road and tunnel , contending that it would give mr wynn an unfair advantage and provide subsidies in a market where none are needed they 're going to come anyway , with or without a roadway , mr trump said today the numbers are so good in atlantic city that they have to come a veto of mr wynn s plan would be a huge victory for mr trump , a nemesis of the mirage chairman in a series of meetings this week with executives from the mirage , the trump organization and representatives from other casinos , mr wilson discussed an alternative highway that would take traffic closer to the existing casinos along the boardwalk before diverting it back inland toward the mirage complex in between his meetings , mr wilson was in close contact with mrs whitman , according to people involved in the talks , but the governor seemed to be fully entrusting mr wilson to reach a recommendation there are intense pressures on her with this , said alan marcus , a lobbyist for mr trump what wilson previewed is a very fair plan you 've got to hand it to him , the guy knows what he s doing however , as of late last week , mr wilson s highway plan still had not resolved one sensitive issue under the latest proposal as well as mr wynn s original proposal a historic africanamerican community of nine houses would be razed to make way for the highway , and residents of the community have already filed a lawsuit against the city to fight the destruction of their neighborhood mr wynn , who is considered one of the most powerful casino developers in the world , could walk away but industry observers say they doubt it if he walks away , it does n't matter to the governor because somebody else is going to develop it , mr marcus said my bet is the person who is going to develop it is steve wynn
it is hard to tell these days whether anyone is minding the kremlin every hour seems to bring word of a new staff upheaval and some outlandish pronouncement by a government official in recent days president boris yeltsin conducted another of his periodic vanishing acts with four days to go before the runoff election for president , the chaotic picture is alarming mr yeltsin s aides reported that his absence from public view was due to a throat ailment , and last night he appeared on russian television looking tired but well but his being out of sight since wednesday had ignited speculation that he was sidelined by renewed heart trouble there were even rumors that he had died moscow is always awash in rumors , but the recent run of kremlin intrigue has created a dangerous climate of instability at a time of high political anxiety in russia it all rekindles questions about mr yeltsin s leadership only days after he finished first in the initial round of presidential balloting and seemed ready to win a second term next week by defeating gennadi zyuganov , the communist candidate instead of steadying his government and his campaign team for a final sprint to election day next wednesday , mr yeltsin seems to have lost control of both that may prove untrue , but many signs point to a leadership vacuum that has been brashly filled by aleksandr lebed , the former general who finished a strong third in the voting earlier this month and was quickly drafted by mr yeltsin as a top security adviser and shadow running mate within hours of mr lebed s appointment , many of the senior commanders of the russian military and security services were sacked that seemed salutary , since many of them had conceived and directed moscow s brutal military campaign in chechnya and none of them were known as students of democracy mr lebed and anatoly chubais , a yeltsin campaign aide , talked darkly of coupplotting in the russian general staff and the kremlin but since then , some of the ousted officials have turned up back at work , and mr chubais , who was one of the chief architects of russia s economic reforms , was cut off from mr yeltsin and ordered to remain out of public view mr lebed , meanwhile , declared this week that foreign religions and cults threatened russian security he called mormonism mold and scum , and then berated a cossack supporter for speaking apologetically , like a jew that may be mr lebed s crude way of appealing to russian nationalists , whose support mr yeltsin needs , but it reflects a raw and ugly strain in his political outlook the most charitable explanation for recent events is that mr yeltsin and mr lebed wanted to show off the many sides of their political profiles to draw support from a divided electorate if so , they went too far the less forgiving view is that mr yeltsin s erratic leadership has taken a new turn toward disorder either way , the kremlin turmoil is not a promising omen for russia s future
ithaca , ny perched atop a hill at the edge of cayuga lake , cornell university is best known as a private ivy league institution , one that just raised 15 billion but it is also part of the state university system , receiving about 170 million a year to teach industrial arts and farming the combination is singular among american universities , and through a mix of lobbying muscle and important alumni in albany , the university has largely been spared from eight years of state cuts to public higher education but now , officials of the state university of new york system , which is facing an 86 million cut in the state s proposed budget , are beginning to question whether cornell should get so much state money if the state ca n't afford to support suny , maybe it should n't be supporting cornell , said arnold gardner , a state university trustee involved in negotiations with cornell today , the four state colleges that are part of cornell receive 15 percent of the tax money that goes to operate the state university system , up from 8 percent a decade ago they are getting 20 percent 200 million of the 1 billion suny is now spending on construction the only new buildings at cornell in the last five years have been paid for by the state despite the recent complaints of mr gardner and others , suny has typically had little leverage over cornell s budget cornell alumni are in leadership roles of both parties in the legislature and in the executive branch in albany its trustees include one of gov george e pataki s campaign chairmen , joseph h holland henrik n dullea , its vice president overseeing the lobbying in albany , was a key democratic operative in the administrations of gov hugh l carey and gov mario m cuomo , serving for a time as governor cuomo s director of operations while the suny trustees set a budget that the other colleges must abide by , cornell officials routinely bypass the budgeting by taking their case to a sympathetic legislature that is not what i would call absolute budgetary control , said william h anslow , suny s senior vice chancellor for finance and management since 1988 , the state university system has had to rely more on tuition to pay for its operations , now 3 , 400 a year at the fouryear colleges state tax money for suny s operating budget has shrunk to 733 million in 1995 , from 12 billion in 1988 but cornell s total dollar amount has been largely unchanged , and its share of suny tax money has grown in 1988 , cornell received 102 million , 86 percent of the state university s appropriation in 1995 , cornell received 111 million , 152 percent of suny s total the enrollment of 8 , 600 students at cornell s four state university colleges is just over 2 percent of suny s 400 , 000 last year , facing a systemwide cut of 185 million , the state university trustees budgeted a 5 million giveback from cornell s state university colleges the colleges agriculture , industrial and labor relations , veterinary medicine , and human ecology are part of the state university because they represent new york state s landgrant college , teaching farming and industrial arts as specified in federal legislation passed more than a century ago cornell balked and began its own lobbying campaign one of those contacted was assemblyman martin a luster , a democrat who represents the ithaca area he was one of several legislators who , in turn , pressured state university trustees he recounted recently that he had threatened the suny board members that he would introduce legislation to lock in cornell s share of the budget permanently i think that got through , he said that pressure , from mr luster and other legislators , led suny to restore 2 million to cornell other campuses protested cuts last year , but none were able to win such a favorable agreement cornell university has always wielded political strength in new york its founder , ezra cornell , was a state senator in 1865 when he won the landgrant designation for the institution he wanted to start in ithaca at that time , each state received federal land scrip it could sell to pay for a college providing education in agriculture and the industrial arts what cornell founded was both public and private , and through the years both portions have grown side by side when suny was created in 1948 , cornell s four public colleges were incorporated into the state university system the private colleges are supported through a private endowment , recently supplemented by the largest fundraising campaign in the history of higher education , a campaign that brought in 15 billion both the public and private portions are overseen by one board of trustees , which has always included the governor , speaker of the assembly and senate majority leader as ex officio members and the governor appoints three other members of the 64member board this is a pretty remarkable blend , it seems to me , of private and public education , said hunter r rawlings , who became cornell s president last summer in a sense , we are able to get the best of both worlds that is , we have very high quality , but at the same time we have a very broad mission and a very broad student body we can provide a very highquality education at a quite reasonable price
the cuban government made prophets of its most caustic critics saturday by shooting two american civil aircraft out of the sky there can be no justification for deliberately killing four civilians who posed no military threat to cuba the united states has responded to this violation of civil aviation conventions in a clear and proportionate way and the international community should now do the same the most important step would be to make cuba s own access to the advantages of international civil air traffic dependent on its showing greater respect for the lives of unarmed fliers and passengers cuba , like any other country , has a right to selfdefense and secure airspace it also lives with a history of american hostility and attempts to overthrow its government so it can be forgiven some paranoia about its northern neighbor and the cuban exile groups long supported by washington but none of that justifies the castro government s murderously disproportionate reaction to the flight of three singleengine cessnas chartered by brothers to the rescue , a miamibased exile group that had previously flown over havana and dropped antiregime leaflets brothers to the rescue s past behavior has been reckless , and it seems determined to raise tensions between washington and havana in this case , cuba says its air controllers warned the pilots that they were entering a danger zone and insists the planes were shot down over cuban airspace , a point washington disputes even if the cuban account is correct , there are less violent , wellestablished ways to deal with intruding aircraft the united nations security council should condemn the attack unequivocally and call on the international civil aviation organization , a un agency , to investigate the episode fully most important , the international community must insist that the castro regime renounce its policy of hairtrigger response to approaching aircraft at the least , it should require that havana adopt the conventional international standards for aerial interception these include requiring defending planes to make visual and radio contact with intruding craft and to rock their wings as a signal for the intruders to land or leave the area to back up this requirement , other countries should be prepared to restrict the landing rights of all civil aircraft serving cuba until havana agrees to abide by these minimal rules yesterday president clinton rightly suspended all charter flights between the united states and cuba , restricted the travel of cuban diplomats in this country and asked congress to provide compensation for the victims' families out of blocked cuban assets in this country it does not make sense for washington to halt telephone service between the united states and cuba and ban wire transfers of money from cubanamericans to their families on the island these measures would make ordinary cubans , rather than the castro regime , pay for the shootdown it would be selfdefeating to withdraw american diplomats from havana , depriving washington of timely information the administration is wrong to give qualified support to legislation that would punish foreign companies doing business with cuba enacting such a law will further divide washington from its allies on cuban issues and thus render american policy less effective the administration should focus on the issue at hand protecting civil aircraft from armed attack the right way to do that is to insist on less deadly interception methods and to target sanctions on cuba s own civilian flights
union city , nj yo escribo y leo el ingles perfectamente , carlos munoz said with a confident wave of the arm el unico problema es para hablar in other words , he said , translating for himself i write and read the english perfect my problem is to speak so what if he is running for congress \? dr munoz \( a veterinarian in his native cuba \) does n't think the language barrier is a huge issue , just a little one look , he said , returning to spanish for the rest of the interview , there are a lot of people in congress now who speak english they 're still not any good at the job and so it is that dr munoz , a republican , is seeking to unseat robert menendez , a democrat , in the 13th congressional district you might argue that several prominent candidates ca n't speak english very well , but dr munoz , 59 , is the first person to seek a federal office who literally needs a translator i'm making history , he said proudly over cafe con leche at a favorite restaurant across the street from his headquarters well , at the very least , dr munoz s language issue is giving him more exposure than he could ever have hoped to receive with no money , no ads and no party support until last week , his campaign was practically a secret mr menendez , meanwhile , seemed blissfully free of the grueling campaign schedule that his colleagues are enduring a lot of people in the 13th district , which covers urban sections of four counties , assumed that the popular incumbent was running unopposed it was n't until dr munoz and mr menendez took part in a televised debate that the challenger s campaign bubbled to the surface even people who do n't live in the district watched the showdown with fascination there was mr menendez , a cubanamerican , speaking quietly , almost wearily , in english , while dr munoz responded like a fireandbrimstone preacher , in spanish \( his translator seemed to have some trouble keeping up with him \) oh , i wish i knew more english , said dr munoz , a big man with an open , ruddy face who widens his eyes to punctuates his sentences it s hard for me to learn , he added , because i'm hard of hearing the fact is , not speaking english has n't been an issue for him in a long time since dr munoz and his wife , lila , moved to hudson county 23 years ago from spain \( where they first settled after fleeing cuba in 1960 \) they 've lived in either west new york or union city these are two of the biggest hispanic enclaves in new jersey dr munoz expected he would practice veterinary medicine here but he had to take a battery of exams , he said , a process that took several years when he went to apply for his license , he said , the american veterinary assocation told him there were only three clinics where he might get a job but when i applied , none had jobs , he said instead , he and his wife ran a bridal shop on the bergenline avenue strip years later , he tried applying for a license again i was told i would have to start the process all over , he said i told the veterinary association i was going to be elected to office and write a law that allows immigrant doctors to continue practicing their profession here between running local campaigns for various republicans , dr munoz , who works at the hudson county welfare office , has been running for various state offices for almost 15 years but he has problems as a candidate beyond his lack of english first , he is a republican in one of the most firmly democratic districts in the state in hudson county , for example , democrats outnumber republicans 6 to 1 these days , dr munoz is also fond of singing the praises of house speaker newt gingrich , who is so unpopular generally that the democrats use his name as a club with which to beat down their republican opponents in a district where crime is a major issue , he supports the national rifle association s position against gun control in a district with many minorities , he is against affirmative action he also favors making english the official language of government in the united states well , i think immigrant children should learn english quickly , so that they could succeed , he said if i knew english , for example , i would go on 'jeopardy , ' he said i'm good at it so how can he expect to go to congress \? look , he said , i know the two most important words a congressman must know he leaned forward conspiratorially the words , he said in english , are yes and no

five years ago a young man from mexico city who identified himself as juan left his family and illegally crossed the border to the united states with no prospects of earning a living and with a wife and two children to feed , he hoped to find a better life here instead of heading toward california like most mexican immigrants , juan traveled to join his brotherinlaw on the south fork , where he was immediately employed as a painter he told us it was a safe place , less crowded than the city and that our children would receive better care , juan said in spanish sister cathi kugler , a social worker for apostolado hispano , a roman catholic program on the south fork , translated the interview with juan juan , 35 , is one of many workers from latin countries , including chile , colombia , costa rica , the dominican republic , el salvador , guatemala , mexico and nicaragua , who are settling on the south fork hispanic immigrants had historically been attracted to the region to be migrant field workers in the growing season and dishwashers and maids in the tourist season but as winter approached they frequently returned to their home countries despite the fact that many continue to be seasonally unemployed , more immigrants are staying longer and calling for their families the community is growing quickly , because of a colony effect , sister cathi said , adding that after a family member finds work , other relatives , as well as their children , often follow and as the community grows , schools , municipalities and church groups are helping the immigrants cope with their problems in 1990 , 812 hispanic people lived in the town of east hampton , accounting for 5 percent of the population , and 1 , 201 , or 26 percent , lived in the town of southampton , according to census figures from roy fedelem of the long island regional planning board on long island , hispanic people made up 63 percent of the population in 1990 , the second largest minority group after blacks spanishspeaking people are the fastestgrowing segment , and , mr fedelem projected that in the census for the year 2000 they would surpass blacks asians , however , including chinese , filipinos , indians and koreans , are the fastestgrowing minority group by percentage on long island , mr fedelem added in 1990 , 24 percent of long islanders were asian , compared with 1 percent in 1980 large groups of asians have settled in several north shore communities , including hempstead , north hempstead and oyster bay because many hispanic immigrants are not legal , officials say , it is difficult to estimate their numbers on the south fork but anthony t rosalia , editor of el mensajero , or the messenger , a free newspaper in southampton , said he thought that the number of hispanic people more than doubled since 1990 he estimated that 2 , 500 hispanic people lived in east hampton mr rosalia founded the newspaper with his mother , lucille , five years ago to help the hispanic and english communities get to know each other , he said published in spanish and english , its circulation ranges from 3 , 100 to 4 , 000 , he added in most public schools on the south fork , the number of hispanic students has more than doubled in five years , according to education officials the town of east hampton , including montauk , reports that it has 200 hispanic students , or almost 13 percent of the enrollment in the district five years ago the district had 76 , or 5 percent , according to an administrator , joseph frascino mr frascino , who recently started a multicultural program in the district , said that most of the hispanic students were in the high school and lived in montauk in 1986 , there was not one english as a second language teacher in the district , the principal of the elementary school in east hampton , dennis donatutti , said now there are five in the southampton district , the increase in hispanic students is consistent with the rest of the south fork , according to the district psychologist and supervisor of the esl program , dr harmon cohen the number grew , from 30 in 1990 to 65 , or 4 percent of the total enrollment in the district last year , and the number of esl teaching positions has increased , from one and a half to three , he said many hispanic singles migrate here , experts said , hoping to save enough money to move their families , a process that can take years but juan was lucky in two months , he said , his wife and two children joined him in southampton i worked day and night to bring them here , he recalled however , they are wetbacks , said sister cathi late one night they waded across the rio grande , escorted by an illegal guide called a coyote , she said they have no legal documents , she added , and they have no hope of getting them sister cathi said it was extremely difficult for mexicans to obtain the documents unless they were part of the government s seasonal farm worker program or family reunification program or were sponsored by an employer in addition to the difficulty of obtaining documentation , the immigrants often face other obstacles

cairo , aug 10 about a decade ago , a car dealer here broadcast advertisements urging people to trade in their donkey carts for pickup trucks it did not quite work to the authorities , the 25 , 000 donkey carts that clipclop obliviously along cairo s trafficsnarled streets are a slowspeed means of transport almost everyone else calls them a nuisance we used to raid the parks , confiscate the animals , send them to the zoo and destroy the carts , said mahmoud reda , a city official but we also know that we cannot punish the people for doing an honest job in a city of great contrasts , none may be starker than the divide between the simple carts and those who drive them and the whizzing mercedesbenzes with which they share the road these animals are like the sons of adam , said salah shahtout , 50 , a wiry man with a brown turban and rough hands , in praise of what he said was the donkeys' humanity we always take the righthand lane yes , it is slow , but we never stop , like taxis and buses a cart driver all his life , mr shahtout is known as an arbagi , an arabic word that is also used as a mild insult but he spoke with pride as he watched donkeys being bought and sold at weekly market on the outskirts of cairo our animals know what to do , he said and they never hinder traffic with a population of 16 million , greater cairo is nearly twice as crowded as it was 10 years ago , and it is so thronged with cars that the city has expanded upward , with engineers building vast flying bridges to allow traffic to flow high above the tangled streets along the nile , horses still pull tourist carriages , but cars have crowded out the other carts that used to act as taxis , waiting outside ramses station to meet passengers arriving by train the city s main vegetable market and slaughterhouse have been relocated outside the city center , making them difficult to reach without motorized wheels some who once relied on carts found the inexpensive , imported pickup trucks to be a worthy reason to trade the reins for the wheel and for those who refused to make the switch , the local authorities tried to settle things in 1991 by officially banning the carts from cairo s streets but they soon gave up they concluded that as many as 100 , 000 families in cairo may depend on income garnered from the carts , about half of them from work as garbage collectors , said mr reda , who is head of the cairo cleaning authority and much as they might want to , few of them could ever conceive of buying a vehicle on their own we could n't just kick them off the streets , mr reda said apart from collecting garbage , the carts tend to be used to haul fruit , vegetables or construction materials at bargain rates of as little as 150 an hour many take to the streets at dawn , before the city has awakened , and they can cover as much as 16 miles in a day at the slow and steady gait that leaves their owners proud at the weekly market in the village of albaragil , hundreds of drivers gather in a dusty lot to watch merchants try to prove the mettle of their animals by having them drag heavy carts with locked wheels among those there was ahmed ali , 65 , who said that he had been born at a donkey s feet in his father s stable mr ali said he once sold nearly all he owned to buy a pickup truck but had come to believe that he was not suited for life behind a steering wheel still , mr ali recognized that not everyone admires the arbagi my father was a cart driver , he said my grandfather was a cart driver now no one respects what i do
new orleans it is just after noon here on an october saturday carl perkins , composer of the song blue suede shoes and the original rockabilly singer and guitarist , stands outside a small guitar store in an ordinarily quiet uptown neighborhood , waiting for filming to resume on a promotional video for his new cd he flew down this morning from his home in jackson , tenn , where he has lived for the last 50 years he takes all the flurry of activity in stride , joking with crew members and photographers , harmonizing on country songs with onlookers and telling stories at age 64 , mr perkins is slim and handsome , with sculptured cheekbones , a prominent chin , an easy smile and a curly , steelgray toupee , which is the topic of frequent jokes by its owner he wears blue jeans , a tight , ribbed crew neck shirt , thick aviator glasses and , yes , blue suede shoes back in the days when that song was popular , he says in his thick tennessee country accent , somebody would always come up with a camera and want a picture of themselves stepping on the shoes i used to carry a wire brush in my back pocket so i could reach down and brush them back to life they sold the brush with the shoes from the street , someone passing on a bicycle stops and yells hey ! carl perkins ! how s it going \? grinning widely , gesturing at all the activity , mr perkins replies well , country as i am , i do n't really know it seems like it s rocking right along things are , indeed , rocking right along for carl perkins , although he seemed admirably unimpressed by that fact mr perkins is , in a sense , the lost man of early rockandroll he was there in memphis at the creation , the bigbang of rock , a contemporary of elvis presley and jerry lee lewis when country music , southern gospel and blues fused into a new hybrid his 1956 song blue suede shoes became as much a rockandroll anthem as great balls of fire or roll over , beethoven yet as the rockets of jerry lee , elvis , little richard , chuck berry and buddy holly shot off into the great american night of legend , mr perkins spent decades touring the middle and the bottom of his profession , battling alcoholism for long , honkytonk years and searching for an everelusive followup to his big hit now mr perkins has written an autobiography \( with the writer david mcgee \) , go , cat , go ! the title comes from the famous refrain of his most famous composition and he has recorded a new cd , of the same title , which includes duets with his old sun records label mate johnny cash as well as george harrison , paul mccartney , ringo starr , tom petty , john fogerty , paul simon and willie nelson suddenly mr perkins seems poised on the brink of a longoverdue rediscovery of course i loved elvis , says mr fogerty , the singersongwriter but i actually had a greater affinity for carl perkins because he was a musician he played guitar and wrote songs , and that spoke directly to me he went right to the middle of my musical soul mr perkins was the archetypal rockabilly he spent his early years in a lake county , tenn , shack without electricity or indoor plumbing he acquired his first guitar from an older black neighbor who traded it to him for a couple of dollars and a onelegged chicken named peg with his two brothers , mr perkins formed a band that became active in the jackson area , playing a mixture of country and rhythmandblues for dancing i do n't think none of us even ever quite knew what it was , he says it did n't have a name we called it feelgood music a few guys got brave enough to get out and start playing it in the honkytonks the honkytonks were rough places where the atmosphere was suffused with the highly charged possibilities of both physical love and violence , and the demands such joints placed on musicians were straightforward they were there to stimulate dancing and drinking the honkytonks were the crucible that shaped both the band s sound and mr perkins s emerging songwriting talents spurred by a chance meeting with presley , who had just made his first recordings for sam phillips s sun records , mr perkins and his band headed for memphis , hoping to audition for mr phillips rebuffed at first , he persisted and eventually got mr phillips to listen , and to take him on in october 1954 , three months after presley s debut , mr perkins cut his first record the recordings gained the band important local exposure , and mr perkins often found himself on the same concert bill with presley even today , mr perkins is awestruck by presley i believe when elvis was born , god said , 'here is a messenger , and i'm going to make him the bestlooking guy , and i'm going to give him every piece of rhythm he needs to move that goodlooking body on that stage' i was fighting a battle working with him , knowing i looked like mr ed , that mule , and here was a guy that could go out and clear his throat and have 10 , 000 people scream in december 1955 , mr perkins struck gold with his third record for sam phillips , a brandnew song he wrote entitled blue suede shoes it became sun records' first millionseller and landed mr perkins a national television appearance on the perry como show the appearance could have done for mr perkins s career what the dorsey brothers' television show was doing for presley s , but it was not to be in march 1956 , en route to new york for their como appearance , mr perkins and his band collided with a truck on a desolate stretch of road in delaware mr perkins suffered a broken collarbone and a severe concussion that put him in a coma
new york city is cracking down on unleashed dogs in its parks although parks department officials dispute the term crackdown more vigorous enforcement in response to public pressure , amends a department spokesman but no matter how you slice it , dog owners who let their pets run loose are more likely to get a 100 ticket than they were a few months ago the change has caused dismay within some doggie circles , and led a few outraged owners to protest so vigorously they wound up in custody we have been down this road before back in the 1980 s , in fact , the author jane delynn devoted a good chunk of her novel real estate to a dog named jack s reaction to a similar crackdown one day , just like that , the unspeakable had occurred he looked around other dogs were on their leashes too great sadness there was in the park that day jack was still brought near and allowed to sniff other dogs , but the rituals of teethbaring and attacking were almost instantly cut short there was no running and demonstrating of hunting skills worst of all , there was none of that camaraderie of dogs being off together as dogs , away and separate from humans the dog owners do have emotion on their side who wants to contemplate the life of retrievers or rottweilers condemned to go through life without ever running on their own \? the city , however , has a clear monopoly on rationality new york has too little green space for even its human inhabitants central park alone caters to almost 15 million visitors a year in the competition for very scarce resources , people must take precedence over animals parks officials speculate that the city s dog population has become larger in both number and physical size since the city council restricted landlords' rights to bar pets from apartments about 15 years ago whether that is true or not , they argue convincingly that this generation of unleashed dogs has become a serious nuisance large dogs knock down children and old people , scare horses on bridle paths and cause significant damage to lawns their owners are not likely to clean up after them as they roam around , and enforcing the city s pooperscooper law is particularly important in areas where children are likely to crawl or play the parks department , in a very new yorkstyle accommodation , has let it be known in every way short of posting billboards that it will not really try to enforce the leash law before 9 am and after 9 pm , except in areas that really need to be dogfree , like playgrounds if the prospect of 12 hours of leash law a day is still too dreadful to bear , dog owners may have to consider trading in for a cat
washington , dec 11 the air force has concluded that the general in charge of a military housing complex in saudi arabia where 19 americans were killed and 500 wounded in a terrorist truckbombing last june took reasonable steps to protect against attack and should not be punished in any way the finding contradicts a major conclusion of a separate pentagon investigation in september that singled out the officer , brig gen terryl j schwalier , for failing to adequately safeguard the khobar towers complex in dhahran , where the blast occurred senior pentagon officials , who described the results of the air force inquiry today on condition of anonymity , said the air force found the deaths a terrible tragedy , but not the fault of general schwalier the officials said the inquiry concludes that none of the 10 officers responsible for the safety of the troops in dhahran violated any laws , air force regulations or codes of conduct under military law , the air force decides who , if anyone , should be held accountable for a disaster like the dhahran bombing the punishments range from mild reprimands to courtmartial proceedings that can lead to prison terms in this case , the air force recommended that no punishment of any kind was warranted officials said air force secretary sheila e widnall and gen ronald r fogleman , the air force chief of staff , had approved the decision to exonerate the officers they said that the finding was expected to be announced later this month defense secretary william j perry has the authority to overrule the air force decision , but pentagon officials said that he would be unlikely to do so surely there is a desire to hang somebody for this , said a senior pentagon official who supports the air force decision but as you look back over the evidence , it s pretty hard without 2020 hindsight to say , 'i 'd have done that' the truck bomb exploded on general schwalier s last day as commander of the air base and housing complex in dhahran he is now in a pentagon job overseeing air force operations and is awaiting a promotion to major general but one official involved in the initial pentagon investigation called the air force s decision to exonerate the general the wrong call he said the families of the victims especially deserved to know who might have been at fault in the bombing the question of responsibility in the bombing has caused deep strains among the armed services while some senior officers have been reprimanded for their roles in recent military disasters , it is rare for a general to face courtmartial when two air force f15 fighters flying over northern iraq mistakenly shot down two united states army helicopters in 1994 , killing all 26 people aboard , only a captain serving as a weaponscontrol officer went to trial he was acquitted similarly , none of the 16 officers , including 2 generals , who were disciplined in connection with the crash in april in croatia that killed commerce secretary ronald h brown and 34 others were courtmartialed but a defense department investigation , headed by a retired army officer , gen wayne a downing , issued a scathing report that said general schwalier did not protect his forces from a terrorist attack the pentagon report said general schwalier did not heed intelligence reports that khobar towers was highly vulnerable to terrorist attack , even though there had already been one deadly terrorist bombing in saudi arabia that had killed five americans and two indians among a number of warnings , one was eerily prescient a security officer wrote that the tightened security on the base could lead terrorists to strike with a truck bomb at the base s fence air force officials said they weighed the same evidence that general downing s commission examined , but came to very different conclusions about culpability officials sympathetic to the air force position made available today selected parts of a classified review the air force conducted into the bombing the review , written by lieut gen james f record , commander of the 12th air force , cites , for example , the assessment of a senior american intelligence official in riyadh , the saudi capital , that the intelligence reports given to general schwalier did not give a target for a terrorist attack in addition , general record s review quotes the american consul general in dhahran , david m winn , saying , no one really thought that anything would happen in dhahran air force officials also said general schwalier took several steps to protect the housing complex , from increasing the number of guard posts to installing a double row of concrete highway barriers around the fenceline air force officials acknowledged that those measures were inadequate there s no disagreement there , said the senior pentagon official who supports the air force decision the fact is , 19 people were killed but then the issue becomes , was there dereliction of duty \? general record , who had the power to recommend general schwalier face courtmartial , concluded there was no such neglect of duty secretary widnall and general fogleman concurred people need to understand that accountability is twoedged sword , said the senior pentagon official who supports the air force decision if you examine someone s actions and you find them wanting , you hold them accountable but if you define that as courtmartialing everyone , i ca n't live by your definition at the same time , if you believe that person is not culpable , the pentagon official continued , then it s every bit your obligation to stand up and defend that person if you do n't do that , you 'll erode the fighting spirit of commanders you 'll have people looking over their shoulders they 'll always know they 'll be secondguessed by people in washington the attack in saudi arabia continues to create thorny problems for the clinton administration in response to fbi complaints that saudi officials had been uncooperative in what was to have been a joint inquiry , riyadh has recently turned over information to support its contention that the bombing plot was heavily supported by iran the information included videotaped interviews with some of the several dozen suspects but some law enforcement officials expressed skepticism over the interviews , saying they lacked credibility because the confessions may have been obtained under duress the air force signaled months ago it did not believe general schwalier was to blame in an internal review that paralleled general downing s inquiry , air force officials said general schwalier s responsibility extended only to the fenced perimeter of the base beyond that , the responsibility for security belonged to the saudis the truck bomb exploded in a parking lot just outside the base s property photo brig gen terryl j schwalier was cleared by air force of neglect \( department of defense \)

despite a persistent gloom about the nation s schools , a comprehensive assessment of science and mathematics education , from elementary to graduate levels , finds significant progress in test scores , curriculum and academic preparation the report by the national science foundation , made public yesterday , found that elementary schools are devoting more time to math and science , more high school students are taking advanced science courses , and student achievement for all ethnic groups has improved over the last 15 years on standardized tests on the other hand , the report , which largely deals with material gathered from 1977 to 1993 , found that achievement varies enormously from state to state and from region to region some states , particularly in the midwest , perform at a level comparable to that of the best performing nations , including south korea and taiwan others , particularly in the southeast , perform at a level equal to the worst , jordan and the report finds continuing chasms in performance among racial groups black and hispanic students , who make up a rapidly increasing percentage of the school population , continue to lag dramatically in test scores , participation in the teaching force and in receiving degrees in math and science for example , the report said that of 366 colleges and universities that awarded doctorates in science and engineering , nearly twothirds awarded no doctorates to black students , and more than half awarded none to hispanic students and the number of black males receiving science and engineering doctorates , always a small fraction , has declined over the last 10 years in 1992 , blacks accounted for only 2 percent of such degrees still , the report mostly provides a much more positive view of the nation s schools and colleges and the direction in which they are headed than the conventional wisdom of incessant educational decline achievement is up , and there are clear signs that the system is changing for the better , said luther williams , assistant director for education and human resources at the national science foundation i think that has to bode well for the future but the signs of progress are more incremental than dramatic the overall trends are up for all groups , said terrence russell , executive director of the association for institutional research , an organization of higher education researchers based in tallahassee , fla that does n't mean there are n't big differences between different ethnic groups and different regions good is not best , but better is better than worse the report , the second to result from 1991 legislation requiring the national science foundation to make biennial assessments of the state of science and mathematics education in the nation , is a compilation of figures on tests , graduation rates , curriculum changes and other assessments , including national and international studies like the national assessment of educational progress it makes particular efforts to gauge recent progress in curriculum and standards on the naep test , the primary source on student achievement in the united states and most recently given in 1992 , performance on math and science tests has improved slightly for all ages and racial ethnic groups over the past 15 years , the report said for example , the percentage of 13yearold black students who were found proficient , scoring 250 out of 500 on the test , increased to 51 percent in 1992 from 29 percent in 1978 and there are signs that students are taking more demanding courses in 1980 , fewer than 20 percent of the states required two or more years of mathematics in 1992 , 86 percent did in 1982 , 79 percent of high school graduates had studied biology in 1992 , the figure was 93 percent for beginning algebra , the figures were 68 percent in 1982 and 79 percent in 1992 for chemistry in the same period they were 32 percent and 56 percent for advanced algebra , they were 37 percent and 56 percent but the report found what it called a startling level of diversity in academic achievement between states math scores for 13yearolds in the best performing states iowa , north dakota , minnesota and maine ranked with taiwan and korea the lowest performing states alabama , louisiana and mississippi and the district of columbia ranked with lowest rated nation , jordan , of 15 surveyed overall , disparities between black and hispanic students and white and asian students narrowed , the report said for example , since 1977 , the number of 9yearolds who scored 200 or above on the test increased by 24 percentage points for black students , 14 percentage points for hispanic students and 9 percentage points for white students scores for asian students were not broken out the gaps existed even among students of the same socioeconomic status on the naep science test , instead of the gap narrowing , the number of 13yearold black students reaching a proficient level grew more slowly than the percentage of white and hispanic students and , despite the increasing diversity of the nation s schools , there has been no corresponding increase in the diversity of the teaching force in 1992 , white teachers taught about 93 percent of 12th grade science and math students there were conflicting figures on the performance of male and female students on science tests , both had comparable scores in elementary school boys did better in middle schools and high schools , but the gap narrowed considerably from 1977 to 1992 but male students did significantly better than female students on scholastic assessment test and american college test scores

five miles down raritan bay , out by the brand new james t white clam depuration plant in highlands , the scene was considerably more cheerful the surf behind doris and ed s restaurant was thick with softshelled clams , and nearly as thick with hartsgroves eight of them , spanning three generations , stood waistdeep in the water all except 9yearold troy jr were jigging crossshaped hoes up and down like pogo sticks in the sandy muck , then scooping out basket after basket of bluegray steamers troy hartsgrove sr emptied his metal basket into a bushel bag and said that s 35 bucks right there ten minutes to get a really good idea of the ups and downs of fishing in new jersey today , though , talk to john vona he stood on the deck of the crystal ann at the dock outside a cape may packing house as 90 , 000 pounds of squid were pumped out of the hold of his boat as he watched countless limp white bodies fly up the conveyor belt to workers who would sort the 12 , 000 , oneday haul into 22pound boxes , mr vona seemed decidedly underwhelmed i 'd rather be fluking , he said , sounding a little bit like a bumper sticker new jersey s 300yearold commercial fishing industry has been utterly transformed in recent years traditional inshore fisheries like the ones mr isaksen and his fellow belford fishermen grew up in fluke , weakfish , porgy are either so depleted or so heavily regulated , or both , that it has become nearly impossible to make a decent living in them now bigger boats , like mr vona s , venture 60 or 80 or 100 miles out to sea and gather up enormous quantities of squid or ocean quahog a jumbo clam used exclusively by canners and other processors or hundreds of miles out for mackerel the result is this in the last five years , notwithstanding overfished stocks , government quotas , creeping coastal development and increasing political pressure from environmental groups and the recreational fishing industry , new jersey s 1 , 800plus commercial fishing boats have caught more seafood , more consistently , than at any time since the early 1960 s more than 177 million pounds of fish and shellfish landed here last year , enough to make the state with the puny 127mile coastline the country s ninth biggest seafood producer the value of the catch has risen steadily , too measured in constant dollars , the catch for the last few years has brought more money at the dock 953 million dollars in 1995 than at any time since world war ii with processing , retail sales and other multiplying effects taken into account , commercial fishing is now estimated to be worth about 600 million a year to the state s economy but this picture of growth is misleading according to a report prepared by rutgers university for the state department of agriculture last year , almost all the increase in catch has been in lowerpriced species , while catches of highvalue fish have declined menhaden or bunker , a bait fish that by itself accounted for the majority of the fin fish that landed here last year , is worth about five cents a pound atlantic mackerel , which has replaced fluke \( about 150 a pound \) and whiting as the state s leading edible fish , brought in about 12 cents a pound last year in 1993 , according to the national marine fisheries service , 80 percent of the nation s ocean quahogs \( 37 cents a pound that year \) , twothirds of its surf clams \( 45 cents \) , a third of its squid \( 30 cents a pound then , now down to 12 \) , and a quarter of its atlantic mackerel \( 8 cents \) landed in new jersey the state has become a leader in volume fishing of course , it s nice to be a leader in something employment in the fishing industry has been stable at about 2 , 700 jobs for at least five years , according to the department of agriculture the depression and massive unemployment found in former new england cod capitals or defunct salmon ports in the northwest is not seen here and new jersey has made the shift to a bulkbased seafood economy without becoming dominated by corporate fleets you sort of ca n't call a 100foot dragger with chilling capacity mom and pop , but that s what it is , said nils stolpe , executive director of the new jersey seafood harvesters association , referring to boats like mr vona s it s family owned , family operated people have grown up from smaller boats to bigger boats nevertheless , though the fisherman may still be master of his own vessel , he is hardly master of his fate these days
when the revival of william inge s 1955 play bus stop opens at circle in the square on thursday , the audience and friends wo n't be the only ones in attendance memories will take up quite a few seats for 478 performances , bus stop was the buzz of broadway the play that followed inge s pulitzer prizewinning picnic by two years , it was considered a surprise departure from his earlier , familybased dramas on the surface the story of four bus passengers marooned overnight at a kansas diner during a snowstorm , its real subjects are loneliness and the struggle to connect to another person bus stop may center on cherie , the club singer who is being abducted by the headstrong cowboy bo , but it is also about how all the characters have come to terms or failed to with their need to love and be loved the sheriff , the bus driver , his passengers cherie , bo , virgil \( bo s friend \) and the shakespearespouting dr lyman plus the restaurant s owner , grace , and her waitress , elma , address the problem in their own ways the current cast , directed by josephine r abady , the coartistic director of circle in the square , includes marylouise parker as cherie , billy crudup as bo , larry pine as virgil and kelly bishop as grace originally produced by robert whitehead and roger l stevens , with the legendary harold clurman directing , the production was notable for its warm reception , the exceptional closeness of its cast and for a series of tragedies that seem to have stretched almost to the present day let us revisit that first production the set , intentionally reminiscent of the paintings of edward hopper , is by the great boris aronson he has made it snow outside grace s diner in smalltown kansas the drifts have stranded cherie \( kim stanley \) bo \( albert salmi \) virgil \( crahan denton \) the alcoholic exprofessor lyman \( anthony ross \) the bus driver , carl \( patrick mcvey \) the sheriff , will masters \( lou polan \) the waitress \( phyllis love \) , and grace herself \( elaine stritch \) the music box program is chockablock with ads i dreamed i went to see 'bus stop' in my maidenform bra there is a note requesting ladies to remove their hats the cast who s who includes recent war service , and there is a reminder that the xavier cugat orchestra is appearing at the starlight roof of the waldorf in the march 3 new york herald tribune , the critic walter kerr announces that kim stanley has finally found a play as winning as she is in the new york times , brooks atkinson calls her performance superb and the production beautifully acted by june , theater arts magazine will publish bus stop a year later , the movie version will be released , starring marilyn monroe robert whitehead remembers we had first done the play in philadelphia kim stanley was very , very gifted , but the leading man was n't right he was physically effective , good at flinging stools around , but bo has to have a coaplete innocence mixed with something dangerous , a kind of unbridled lust for life he s not housebroken albert salmi had just closed in 'the rainmaker ' and i grabbed him he suddenly brought kim to life , and she knew it , knew the play had n't been working , that it did n't have its life force until the two of them were together i remember the enormous sense of relief when i felt we 'd achieved the inside of the play bill inge s truthfulness was absolutely marvelous he did n't have the size or colors tennessee williams had , or the social thrust of arthur miller , but there was a quietness that was moving and ultimately poetic we changed only a few thingp as we went along for instance , originally the professor like inge , an alcoholic struggling , not as the playwright did with his closeted homosexuality but with a weakness for young girls committed suicide yes , as inge would in 1973 those are the interesting things in life , are n't they , the frightening things opening night was a real love affair with the audience we did n't have big parties back then we all just went up the street together to some cafe to wait for the reviews of course , every night i spent a great deal of time down in kim s dressing room persuading her to go on she always had some reason why it was almost impossible then tony ross died just had a heart attack at home one day and did n't show up for the matinee that threw kim into a kind of panic , and she could n't go on we put in the understudy who was tammy grimes at the time kim left before her contract was fulfilled i have n't seen her for eight or nine years the last time i spoke with albert salmi was about five years ago i asked him , 'how do you feel about your career \? ' he said , 'i do n't feel much about it my family has made me survive , not my career , and i guess that s better than most' he shot himself not long after that , and also shot his wife jo ann kirchmaier , inge s niece and literary executor , remembers i was there opening night and i loved it ! this was n't about our family it was the first time i saw billy writing about someone i did n't know , although there was something of billy in bo s character bo was like he wished he could be billy was a manicdepressive , a very lonely man he did a lot of thinking elaine stritch remembers i do n't believe in favorites , but 'bus stop' was close to it it s amazing how clear to me it still is everybody connected to the company was stellar there was n't a bad egg in the basket just to watch kim stanley every night was a treat i was so caught up in the play , i went in every night feeling like i owned that diner , and i'm not talking about any of that method stuff and the closeness tony ross and i took the door down between our dressing rooms i had a long interval before coming back on stage after grace goes upstairs to her apartment with carl so i used to take off my costume and play cards with the stagehands at the first runthrough with a small invited audience , i lost track of time i must have been winning and when i heard my cue , i just grabbed a chenille robe off the wardrobe rack and put it on well , the audience thought it was terrific ! because supposedly grace goes upstairs with carl to raise hell , but you do n't know if they 're just smoochin' or sparks really fly the audience understood what must 've gone on when they saw the robe harold loved that , and kept it in the play where it has remained ever since kim stanley , in santa fe , nm , not far from tiny tularosa , where she was born , remembers the truth is , we had such a magnificent time we were all crazy about each other it was one of those rare perfect experiences in the theater for me cherie s a delightful part it s hard not to love that girl i was very close to mr inge he was a wonderful man complicated , like all us showbiz people the last time i saw him was very , very long ago but all these people are very much alive in my heart josh logan came backstage to tell me that he was going to direct the movie of 'bus stop' and that he was casting miss monroe as cherie i understood why she was very famous and she was absolutely right for the role those of us who had been at the actors studio with her knew she could act none of us took her for the lightweight the public did she never talked to me about 'bus stop' she was much too sensitive a person , and that would have been gauche tell the cast that i send them the best , and that they have a lovely , lovely play photos elaine stritch , left , and kim stanley in william inge s 1955 bus stop on broadway , where a revival opens on thursday \( arthur zinn bus stop \) \( pg 5 \) marylouise parker as cherie , in the current bus stop \( sara krulwich the new york times \)
san diego if you are a republican and trailing in the polls , it makes no sense to revive the dark memories of watergate , especially if you plan to make an issue of bill clinton s character the ghost of richard nixon was therefore not much in evidence here this week haley barbour , the republican national chairman , paid brief tribute to mr nixon s foreign policy successes and recognized tricia nixon and her husband at 10 am on opening day , when the convention hall was halfempty and the tv cameras were off thereafter , delegates in search of mr nixon had to settle for visits to the gop s memorabilia room , where for only 6 you could get your picture taken sandwiched between lifesized cutouts of him and elvis presley none of this is the least bit surprising but for a reporter who had covered mr nixon s comeback in 1968 , and had heard him speak often of his fondness for california , there was something at once eerie and sad about his neartotal exclusion from a gathering of the republican faithful in his home state , and in a place he once called his lucky city still , mr nixon s legacy was felt here in many ways patrick buchanan owes his start in politics to him , and bob dole may owe him even more but the strongest evidence of his influence , though not visible to the television audience , was the presence of a cadre of old nixon hands , veterans of the 1968 and 1972 campaigns , who gathered here to help create the kind of controlled , tightly scripted pageantry that mr nixon himself virtually invented most of these graying nixon types learned their skills as advance men , the people who get the candidate where he is supposed to go , assist the media , assemble the crowds and make sure the balloons drop on time here they were again , working for someone else but as one of them put it , the old man would have been proud to see us here a stroll by the command posts and trailers parked inside the convention hall produced a dozen sightings in as many minutes there were bill timmons and tom korologos , who ran the white house congressional liaison office mr timmons helped put this show together mr korologos is a senior aide to mr dole henry cashen , deputy white house counsel under john ehrlichman , kept the endless procession of convention speakers under firm control ron walker , a legendary advance man in the old days , was chief troubleshooter elsewhere on the premises were other nixon veterans who are likely to occupy major posts in the coming campaign donald rumsfeld , whom mr nixon brought from congress to the white house , is mr dole s policy director bob ellsworth , the former kansas congressman , was chairman of the vicepresidential search committee that produced jack kemp john sears is thought to be in line for a pivotal post in the kemp campaign mr ellsworth and mr sears ran mr nixon s preconvention campaign in 1968 , until john mitchell shoved them aside like mr nixon , both are survivors these and the other nixonites said they understood why mr nixon had been virtually erased from the party s institutional memory , and they showed no bitterness gerald warren , mr nixon s deputy press secretary and later editor of the san diego union , put it this way the party wants to heal , not reopen , old wounds under the circumstances , i do n't see what more the convention could or should have done not a single member of the nixon old guard has taken part in the buchanan campaign , even though mr buchanan was a fellow soldier in the earlier nixon wars they are pragmatic , nonideological people , and while they see some linkage between mr buchanan s combative us vs them posture and mr nixon s often divisive appeals to the silent majority in 1972 , they do not believe the president could have swallowed mr buchanan s harsh nativism on immigration or foreign policy joining up with mr dole was an easier matter though the relationship between mr nixon and mr dole was ambiguous and sometimes stormy , mr dole was the president s strongest senate ally in the early white house years and a loyalist during watergate beyond that , mr dole shares with mr nixon the same humble upbringing and the same political tenacity it is not surprising that mr nixon s proteges found themselves drawn to san diego their only regret was that the man who introduced them to the political game flew so far off course that even today he is denied honor in his own party robert b semple jr
warsaw , may 2 since they marched under the solidarity banner in the 1980 s , poles have been galvanized by few issues as much as the death penalty when a 19yearold university student who had witnessed an armed assault was shot to death on a warsaw sidewalk in march , some 30 , 000 people poured onto the streets carrying banners with slogans calling for death to his killers the murder of wojciech krol , an honors student who had stayed in warsaw that weekend to study instead of going home to visit his parents , brought to the surface the pentup frustrations of many poles over a rising crime rate and inadequate policing in postcommunist poland the demand for capital punishment , particularly on campuses , is an embarrassment for the government , now led by former communists , which is just getting around to revising the country s stalinistera penal code to smooth its way into the european union , which it anxiously wants to join , poland must abolish the death penalty hungary , the czech republic and romania have already done so poland imposed a moratorium on executions last november none have been carried out since 1988 , and no one sits on death row but the death penalty remains on the books while parliament debates a new criminal code president aleksander kwasniewski and prime minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz have said they favor abolishing the death penalty but the minority partner in the coalition government , the polish peasants' party , insists that hanging should remain in the criminal code and in universities , whether in dormitory bull sessions or in law school seminars , students are demanding an eye for an eye i was not surprised by the outpouring for the death penalty after wojciech s death , said pawel cichocki , a student at the engineering department at the polytechnic in warsaw , where mr krol was a student a friend of mine was severely beaten two weeks ago our feelings are running high poland has the highest number of prisoners per capita in europe for every 100 , 000 people there are 160 prisoners that compares with 84 in france and 523 in the united states , according to the sentencing project , a nonprofit group in washington public opinion surveys show a constant support of about 60 percent for the death penalty jerzy malinowski , 23 , a geology student who lives on the dormitory floor where mr krol s room was , explained why two years ago a friend of mine was murdered , he said we were coming back from a disco and four guys came up to us i managed to get away my friend was stabbed 12 times in the chest mr malinowski said he was angered by what he considered a light sentence for the killer because he was under 21 , he only got 6 years , he said the slaying of mr krol followed the killing in february of a 21yearold medical student in gdansk by a gang of drunken teenagers who threw him off a train , and the shooting of a 12year oldboy in lodz after the gdansk killing , more than 5 , 000 students and faculty members marched through the city s streets , bearing black banners and demanding tougher laws compared with some western european countries , poland s reported crime rate remains low in 1994 , for example , there were 2 , 347 reported crimes per 100 , 000 people in poland , compared with 6 , 169 in france but reports of crime , particularly violent crime , have surged since 1989 , leaving people who had been accustomed to communistimposed security alarmed the number of homicides doubled from 556 in 1989 to 1 , 134 last year , the police said the roman catholic hierarchy in poland has taken a stand that does not oppose the death penalty , but calls for it only in extreme cases while most polish judges 61 percent in one survey favor continuing the death penalty , some in urban centers say that a better way to deter crime would be to increase the efficiency of the police , prosecutors and the courts it now takes an average of two years between commission of the crime and sentencing when justice is so long delayed , the punishment loses its deterrent effect , said andrzej murzynowski , a law professor at warsaw university and chairman of the penal department of the polish supreme court mr murzynowski said he was trying to convince legislators that the death penalty should be abolished but in stages , so that poles can get accustomed to the idea that capital punishment is not necessary
to the editor as alderman of the 42d ward , where the magnificent mile is situated , i am vexed by paul goldberger s allegations that we are ravaging our heritage and destroying the architectural environment here in chicago in chicago , a tale of lost magnificence , june 16 the tone of his article is highly inflammatory , endeavoring to stir up controversy where none should exist this is insulting to all of us who have worked hard to insure the economic prosperity and esthetic beauty of chicago s central boulevard we are disappointed that mr goldberger is profoundly depressed because chicago s north michigan avenue has not preserved every single one of its mediumsize commercial buildings but rather has made way for large modern buildings he overlooks the fact that we have preserved many of these older buildings and maintained the midrise scale of the avenue in the 25 years i have served on the chicago city council , i have seen north michigan avenue blossom into an economic giant and a prosperous mercantile center rivaling fifth avenue i find it quaint that a new yorker would recommend that we keep this city in antiquarian limbo while the glass towers and commerce of his city reap money mr goldberger is depressed well , i am elated by the new north michigan avenue it is beautiful and prosperous , and the tourist dollars continue to roll in burton f natarus chicago
the 38th annual grammy awards , which were presented in february , hardly lacked media attention but one aspect of the televised ceremony was curiously overlooked the appearance of the 21yearold violinist maxim vengerov , whose teldec recording of shostakovich and prokofiev concertos had been nominated for a grammy for four minutes , mr vengerov s scorching performance of the concluding burlesque of shostakovich s first violin concerto reached a global television audience estimated at more than a billion people probably more than have ever heard any classical musician , except , of course , for those three tenors next sunday , mr vengerov will give a recital in avery fisher hall , a relatively intimate setting compared with the 6 , 500seat shrine auditorium in los angeles , the site of the grammy show speaking recently by telephone from his home in amsterdam , the violin prodigy , who was born in siberia , still sounded dazed by the grammy experience it was always my dream to be at this show , but i could n't imagine i could be there , he said why choose me \? in truth , mr vengerov was not the first choice itzhak perlman , a grammy nominee like mr vengerov , was scheduled to perform at the ceremony but he withdrew five days before , when his father suffered a stroke , which ultimately proved fatal mr perlman recommended mr vengerov instead mr vengerov was scheduled to perform in milan , italy , with the novosibirsk philharmonic and was determined not to cancel novosibirsk is the city where i was born and where i played my first concert with an orchestra when i was 6 , he said in thickly accented english so i'm very thankful to this orchestra and its conductor , arnold katz , because maybe if i had n't played my first concert with them , i would n't be invited to the grammys pierre cossette , the producer of the awards program , decided to try to accommodate mr vengerov s commitments we rehearse our show on wednesday morning , the day of the show , and there was no way he could get there , mr cossette said so we rehearsed the orchestra without him and meanwhile flew him from italy to california by private plane he came popping in about an hour before show time with no rehearsal none of us knew him , and we did n't even know he was just a kid mr vengerov , who is already a veteran of the concert stage , was unfazed a longtime fan of rap , he was excited to discover that his dressing room was next to the rapper coolio s in any case , the backstage atmosphere was hardly conducive to preperformance introspection it was a madhouse , said the clarinetist richard stoltzman , who , along with the vocalist and conductor bobby mcferrin , presented the classical grammys max was guarding his instrument so it did n't get crushed before he got onstage by the props , lights and cameras that were whizzing by everywhere when it came time to play , mr vengerov stood on a circular platform that was placed next to the conductor , zdenek macal once the violinist tore into the unrelentingly fast movement of the shostakovich , the orchestra and mr macal could barely keep up dramatically lighted from behind , mr vengerov radiated a demonic aura , and both the camera angle and the lighting served to accentuate the bow hairs that snapped and swirled about him no one could have predicted how the audience would react to this lastminute substitute for mr perlman that s a real tough audience to play for , mr mcferrin said sometimes it s hard to see any reaction from anybody present , not even a twitch of an eyelash it can be kind of deadpan but not this time after witnessing more than two hours of carefully packaged , hightech performances , the assembled masses seemed stunned by this display of oldfashioned musical virtuosity and heartfelt passion he absolutely blew that audience away , mr cossette said there was a major standing ovation everybody was right up on their feet it was a beautiful thing to watch mr vengerov had to fly back to italy after the performance , so there was little time to mingle with the other grammy nominees he did not even meet coolio mr stoltzman , who went to congratulate the violinist , had to search for him backstage i expected that he 'd be surrounded by a wave of admirers , mr stoltzman said but i found him in the basement , putting his violin away there were n't very many people patting him on the back i went over to him and said , 'gee , that was great' he looked at me and said 'do you think so \?

some bridge players work their brains harder than others at the card table one of the hardest workers is bob levin of aventura , fla , a former world champion who held the east cards on the diagramed deal from the 1995 international team trials in las vegas , nev he responded one heart to one diamond , and wound up defending four spades levin digested the information he had from the bidding it was clear that south had a strong hand with length in both black suits it was also probable that he held exactly two hearts he could not have a singleton , for west would have bid differently with five it was now highly likely that south was short in diamonds , and if he had none , there was little chance for the defense so when the diamond queen was led and south played low from dummy , levin made the remarkable play of putting up the ace he then shifted to a heart , and the defense took two tricks in that suit with a trump trick to follow note that if east had played low on the first trick , south would eventually have been able to throw hearts from dummy on his clubs and make his game that was down one , but levin s brilliance did not result in a gain for his team in the replay , north played in four spades , presumably having bid that suit in response to a takeout double now it was easy for east to lead a heart , for the same result , and no imps changed hands the greater new york bridge association s big apple sectional tournament begins tomorrow at the church of st paul the apostle , 10 columbus avenue , manhattan , with this schedule tomorrow , proam pairs 7 30 pm \( requires preregistration call \( 212 \) 7176364 \) saturday , betty kaplan swiss teams and stratified open pairs 1 pm and 7 pm diagram
a fairly basic tenet of economics holds that as worker productivity increases , so does labor s share of national income to some analysts , however , the experience of the recent past has stretched that rule to the limit so far this decade , workers are not reaping the benefits of greater productivity , they argue , even as profits have posted sharp gains and the stock market has soared to record levels the bottom line is that this has been a very powerful competitive revival for corporate america , said steven s roach , chief economist at morgan stanley , and an extraordinary environment for investors but the worker has not nearly enjoyed as prosperous an opportunity given that disparity , mr roach says that at some point labor will intensify its demands for a bigger piece of the national economic pie searching for signs of inflation , economists like mr roach have for some time been on the lookout for a rise in wage rates indeed , while the federal reserve noted that wage pressures were intensifying in some parts of the country , one of the big surprises of the current economic expansion has been how modest wage gains have been given the size of the productivity gains , wage rates might have been expected to climb although a gap between productivity and real wages began to appear in the 1980 s , in this decade it has grown to unprecedented proportions output per man hour has increased at a little more than 2 percent a year in the first half of the 1990 s , according to mr roach by contrast , real compensation per hour increased at an average annual rate of just sixtenths of a percent the contribution of the worker has risen more than three times the reward , he said those gains have resulted in rising corporate profits , which as a share of national income have risen two percentage points over the last three years , to 10 percent about half of that gain has come at the expense of employees in the same period , employee compensation as a percentage of national income has fallen by about a percentage point , to just under 74 percent sweeping corporate layoffs , which between 1991 and 1995 came to nearly 25 million jobs , help account for the rise in productivity , and also why labor has not been pushing for more never in our history have american workers been asked to do so much for so little , said allen sinai , chief economist at lehman brothers costcutting employers have all the power in this equation , he said workers have none rather , workers are more apt to pressure washington for relief mr sinai and others find that forecast implausible , in large measure , they argue , because labor is getting more than government statistics or mr roach suggest if true , that might explain why the worker backlash mr roach says could materialize has not already arrived indeed , respondents to a recent nbc news wall street journal poll said by nearly 2 to 1 that they were better off now than they were four years ago in a recent paper , robert j gordon , an economist at northwestern university , presented findings suggesting why that may be so after looking at wage , productivity and inflation data from 1963 through the second quarter of last year , mr gordon asserts that contrary to published statistics , real wages have not been flat , but have , in fact , gone up the reasons , he writes , are that productivity growth has been overstated , inflation has been overstated and growth in compensation understated correcting for what he sees as an upward bias in the consumer price index , mr gordon estimated that real consumption wages were 61 percent higher at the end of the second quarter of 1995 than they were in 1972 but in the paper and in a subsequent interview , mr gordon cautioned that his conclusions refer to widely varying experiences of more than 100 million households my story is that everybody is better off than what almost anybody else thought , he said rising corporate profits have helped to bolster stock prices , and workers , through investment vehicles like 401 \( k \) retirement plans and company pension plans , have much more of a stake in the performance of financial markets than before still , mr gordon acknowledged that while everybody may be doing a bit better than previously thought , gains at the top far exceed those in the middle none of these estimates include capital gains , he said , which is much of the way the rich have gotten richer the average person is doing better , but the gains at the top are better still mr roach is unmoved by many of these arguments the gap between productivity and real compensation may be a little bit smaller , he said , but i do n't buy the notion that it is a statistical mirage if you tell american workers that , i do n't think they will believe you graph sowing seeds of labor distress \?

washington , may 15 in a complete collapse of accountability , the government agency that builds spy satellites accumulated about 4 billion in uncounted secret money , nearly twice the amount previously reported to congress , intelligence officials acknowledged today the agency , the highly secretive national reconnaissance office , said last year that the surplus money totaled no more than about 1 billion congressional intelligence overseers said in december that the amount was about 2 billion they were misinformed the secret agency was unaware until very recently exactly how much money it had accumulated in its classified compartments to put the 4 billion in perspective , what the national reconnaissance office did was to lose track of a sum roughly equal to the annual budgets for the federal bureau of investigation and the state department , combined john nelson , appointed last year as the reconnaissance office s top financial manager and given the task of cleaning up the problem , said in an interview published today in a special edition of defense week that the secret agency had undergone a fundamental financial meltdown senior intelligence officials confirmed mr nelson s unusually candid account , and said the meltdown was fueled by excessive secrecy , financial incompetence and a lack of accountability at the agency all the money spent by the secret agency , a clandestine branch of the air force , is hidden through various false line items that make up the socalled black budget , which finances secret intelligence and military programs and is shielded from public scrutiny the existence of the reconnaissance office was itself a state secret , though badly kept , until 1992 the reconnaissance office issues secret government contracts to build systems and components for space satellites that take pictures , record radar images and eavesdrop on telecommunications it spends about 6 billion in secret money a year building the satellites for the central intelligence agency , the air force and the navy while technically adept , it was financially inept , senior intelligence officials said it had 15 different accounting systems in its 15 different program offices , each kept secret from one another everybody did it a little different , none of them talked to each other , and it was a mess , mr nelson told defense week this was literally a house on fire in many ways the financial incompetence of the reconnaissance office meant that one of the nation s biggest intelligence agencies misinformed congress , the director of central intelligence and the secretary of defense about how much money it had on hand , mr nelson said the agency s secrecy made congressional oversight next to impossible , intelligence officials said thus , the congressional intelligence committees kept appropriating money for the secret agency , unaware that it was building up a surplus of billions of dollars the reconnaissance office found itself in trouble in 1994 for constructing what several senators called a stealth building the senate intelligence committee protested that the agency had built itself a headquarters outside washington , costing more than 300 million , without disclosing the building s true cost and size the agency s financial managers explained the lapse by saying they had treated the construction project as if it were a covert operation , and had broken the financing for the building into indecipherable fragments to hide the cost
tokyo , may 12 to some acclaim and selfacclaim , the japanese government started a fund last year to make payments to women forced into brothels run by the imperial army the project was supposed to ease criticisms that japan had shirked its responsibility for wartime atrocities but these days the program is in a crisis , and instead of easing antagonisms with japan s neighbors , it may worsen them , while raising new doubts about japan s readiness to face its past the fund has raised only a fraction of the money that is necessary , its most prominent backer has resigned in protest at the government s behavior , and prime minister ryutaro hashimoto refuses to say whether he will honor a pledge by his predecessor to apologize to the former comfort women moreover , some of the women have complained that the project is so insignificant as to be an insult backers say that there is still a chance that more donations , which are being sought from the public and from corporations , will be raised in the coming months and that mr hashimoto will agree to apologize to the women but nearly everyone agrees that the project is at a turning point if the current government says we will not send you a letter of apology , we will not give our money , then the japanese future will become very difficult , mutsuko miki , the wellknown widow of a former prime minister and the most prominent backer of the fund , said in a telephone interview in that case , i do n't think japan will be able to stand on the world stage mrs miki , who has just resigned from the panel of backers of the fund , said she met with prime minister hashimoto this month and decided that his ideas were so different from hers that it would be meaningless to continue another longtime supporter of the fund , yasuaki onuma , a professor of international law at tokyo university , said it would be a catastrophe for japan if mr hashimoto failed to send out letters of apology mr onuma said that the program could still be saved but that it was at a crossroads it s up to the government , he said if the government clearly understands that the reputation of japan depends on the success of this enterprise , it will be resolved but if they do not understand , then we will have a terrible result more than 50 years after the end of world war ii , japan s wartime conduct remains a source of bitterness between japan and other asian countries , particularly china and north and south korea one of the most sensitive issues is japan s refusal to help the women , who were mostly teenage girls kidnapped from farms and villages and forced to work in frontline brothels and have sex with 20 or more soldiers a day by some accounts , there may have been 100 , 000 or more such women , although many died young and only about 500 have come forward in recent years and identified themselves most of the women were korean , but there were also filipinas , chinese and a few dutch the government has refused to assist the women , on the ground that in earlier years long before their existence became public tokyo had already settled all warrelated claims but embarrassed by calls at home and abroad , the government in july started a private asian women s fund , which was authorized to gather donations and make payments to the women the prime minister then , tomiichi murayama , said he would write a letter of apology to each of the women the fund s organizers said they expected to gather 10 million to 20 million but so far the fund has raised less than 35 million while many individual japanese have contributed , corporate donations have been far less than expected one problem is that some of the women and the organizations campaigning for them have denounced the fund , saying the government should compensate the women directly instead of relying on private contributions one group of women and their supporters called the fund an insult to the war victims and a desecration , and promised to denounce any japanese corporations that contributed to it backers of the fund say that direct government assistance is politically impossible , and that it is better to give the women some help rather than none at all government officials are reluctant to discuss the fund , apparently because of the difficulties it is in , but a foreign ministry official , takahisa tsugawa , suggested that it would look more promising later on when money begins to be paid out he added that the fund s ability to raise more than 3 million shows that the efforts have begun to bear fruit mr hashimoto has contributed to the fund , as have his wife and children he said at a news conference on friday that he would offer his utmost support to the fund , which he described as troubled by its difficulty in raising money but mrs miki says mr hashimoto indicated to her that he would not apologize as his predecessor had promised to do the government has changed , and now they are saying totally different things , mrs miki said an official in mr hashimoto s office said only that there had been no decision on whether mr hashimoto would apologize to the women
ibrahim alkhalil , iraq , sept 15 even as they perched among their suitcases on the way to the turkish border , the families aboard bus no 8 remained reluctant to tell their last names among iraqi kurds , these were the lucky ones , employees of american government agencies who began heading today toward resettlement in the united states but everyone on the bus had worked in the northern city of erbil , which kurdish guerrillas backed by iraqi tanks seized from a rival faction 15 days ago , and none was yet ready to believe that freedom lay ahead not until their convoy reached a onelane bridge that led across the khabur river and toward the relative safety of a turkish military camp did the shadow cast by the government of president saddam hussein finally appear to recede basim yousef dohoka , spelled out a man who until then would identify himself only as basim america gave us a promise , and we trusted them they have been taking good care of us in fact , as the first of the more than 2 , 000 kurds to whom the united states has promised refuge left iraqi soil , american officials were nowhere in sight they were said to be waiting near a turkish tank on the far side of the bridge to welcome the local administrators , clerks , translators and drivers left behind when united states personnel fled from northern iraq on aug 31 but an american diplomat in the reception team told reporters that the united states , with turkey s help , would move swiftly to transport the refugees to their new american homes he said the united states was making good on an obligation to protect its own we believe there is a potential threat to these people , said the diplomat , francis j ricciadone , deputy chief of mission at the united states embassy in turkey the potential threat is saddam hussein as the refugees set out today toward an uncertain future , many looked numb to leave northern iraq , they had to climb out of their buses and walk across the 100yard bridge , tugging children , lugging bags and clutching scrawled names and phone numbers that were all they knew of the united states but aboard bus no 8 , whose passengers had gathered anxiously in a dirt lot outside the city of dohuk , the mood began to lift as the convoy whisked its way without incident through checkpoints controlled by the kurdish faction that aligned itself with president hussein s army with a fear shared by the united states , most of those aboard were convinced that as employees of the american government , they would be hunted down if the iraqi leader used his alliance with the kurdistan democratic party to extend control over northern iraq , which western allies had declared a protected region for iraqi kurds after the 1991 persian gulf war to live is more important than anything else , said mr dohoka , who like everyone aboard left his house , his furniture and nearly everything else behind my son is 6 , and he started school this year god willing , he 'll start school again in the united states the united states is evacuating only current employees of its agencies and relief organizations under contract to them , angering other iraqi kurds who worked for american agencies in the past and believe that they are equally at risk but no one made any attempt to disrupt today s operation , which was organized largely by the kurds themselves all of the 449 men , women and children in the group that was the first across the border this afternoon had traveled from the iraqi town of dohuk , an hour s drive to the south the group included more than 300 people who had made their way to dohuk from erbil and sulaimaniya , further to the south at least one person in each family had worked for the office of foreign disaster assistance , an arm of the state department , beginning an exodus from northern iraq that by late monday is expected to leave empty all offices and operations of that agency and the military cooperation committee , a small headquarters maintained by the united states and its allies the european union has said it may undertake a mission of its own to pull out iraqi kurds who worked for its relief agencies , offering asylum to as many as 6 , 000 employees and their relatives together with the american move , such an operation would strip northern iraq of much of its besttrained and besteducated citizens officials of the kurdistan democratic party have insisted that their alignment with iraqi government forces in the assault on erbil was merely a tactical measure to counter iraqi kurds backed by iran they say they have no intention of allowing mr hussein to reassert his influence over northern iraq , and they provided the buses and security for today s evacuation there is no visible evidence of any iraqi presence in the region , and many of the international aid workers still in northern iraq contend that american concerns about security are exaggerated they have warned that the effective shutdown of the american military and relief operations will cripple efforts to assist the iraqi kurdish population but the partnership , even if shortlived , between the party and the iraqi government has traumatized many iraqi kurds , and even those whose eyes welled with tears this morning as they prepared to leave northern iraq made clear that they felt privileged to leave it will be hard for me to start over after all these years , said a 39yearold program officer for the american aid agency s office in erbil , who out of concern for relatives left behind identified himself only as shwan our future is not clear but there is no other choice those without children of their own were in many cases accompanied by parents or siblings , traveling in family groups so large that american officials estimated that the 2 , 000 to 2 , 500 iraqi kurds to be withdrawn would include only about 300 employees of united states agencies karman osman , 24 , who was a guard at the aid agency s office in erbil , was among the few traveling alone he carried only his prayer rug , slippers and a zippered vinyl bag i imagine the united states with no war , but with democracy , mr osman said it must be very beautiful the people there enjoy all the freedom , and no one asks you what your religion is map of iraq shows the location of dohuk
it s only an old sock , after all a stiff , shabby sock in which a key is put before it s thrown out the window to callers at a rundown apartment building in northwest london but in the remarkable hands of michael gambon and lia williams the stars of david hare s absolutely splendid skylight , which opened last night at the royale theater that sock acquires , with a few casualseeming gestures , as many shades of meaning as desdemona s handkerchief as the edgy , eternally restless businessman tom sergeant , mr gambon arrives at the flat of kyra hollis \( ms williams \) , his former mistress , with sock in hand and a whole wardrobe of fear and longing he does n't quite know what to do with so he twirls the sock , like an oldtime music hall performer , in a flashy , awkward invitation to reopen a dialogue that shut down into silence three years earlier it is obvious that the first and last thing these people want to do is touch each other instead , tom playfully brushes the sock against kyra s neck she grabs at it he tugs at one end she reluctantly tugs back then they give up the game the pause that follows resounds with their unspoken question where on earth do we go from here \? neither mr hare , the author of such incendiary plays as plenty and a map of the world , nor mr gambon , the great english actor , is averse to grand gestures and skylight , a royal national theater production that arrives from london with its two original stars , definitely has its share of those passionate statements of belief , fullvoiced cries of pain and the angry , desperate flinging of books and cutlery but under the exquisite , carefully calibrated staging by richard eyre , the national theater s departing director , it s the fumbling , aborted gestures that speak loudest and that tear at the heart long after the play is over skylight is the story of an unbridgeable gulf between two people an idealistic , innercity schoolteacher and the upscale restaurateur for whom she once worked who , on one level , were made to be together it is certainly mr hare s most heartfelt statement on an age that seems to thwart all hope of sustained connections , whether between lovers , social classes or thatcherites and socialists the exasperation this inspires has infused all of mr hare s works but usually he has begun with a panoramic view of a society or an institution \( the church , in last season s racing demon \) , then zoomed in on the individuals within it , often to overly schematic effect here , his starting point is with individuals and while their story opens windows on the paralyzed , sickly england in which the play is set , mr hare never betrays the complexity of his characters or the currents that both bind and isolate them the result is more fluidly organic than , and every bit as articulate as , any of his previous works it is also , by far , his most emotionally accessible play throughout skylight , tom and kyra are locked in a wrenching dance of desire and frustration , reaching out , shuffling forward and then quickly drawing back , like children fascinated by a fire these rhythms are most literally realized in mr gambon s sly , sad footwork watch how he tentatively props , and then withdraws , a wellpolished shoe on the rung of a chair in which ms williams sits , or his almost balletic scuttle across the stage , as tom seeks to impress the woman he lost but ms williams s more contained kyra , who is 20 years younger than tom , finds her own , equally affecting cadences of advance and retreat , of opening into a luminous vulnerability and then slamming the door on it this is a couple for whom even the most commonplace subjects are riddled with danger words catch in their throats like razor blades when kyra remarks simply that she likes old movies , adding , they have something we do n't , it is clearly the wrong thing to say the dialogue onstage has reached another stalemate , and its participants have to start all over again the back story of tom and kyra is certainly thorny enough to make even casual talk a dangerous proposition for years , kyra was tom s invaluable business associate , a babysitter of his children , a close friend of tom s wife , alice , and also tom s mistress when alice discovered the affair , kyra bolted from the sergeants' lives when she sees tom again , alice has been dead of cancer for a year kyra s reunion with her former lover is prefaced by a visit from tom s 18yearold son \( played with winning adolescent woundedness by christian camargo \) , who tells her something of the hell into which his father has since descended as tom will later say of his wife s illness and its consequences , in a tone of blistering bewilderment you suffer that s what you do there are no shortcuts death and infidelity , and the guilt they engender , would seem to be enough to take on for one play but mr hare , being mr hare , offers quite a bit more to consider tom and kyra are , in a sense , variations on political types he has presented before the dynamic capitalist who defines himself by accumulation \( like the souldevouring press lord in pravda , written with howard brenton \) and the idealist who flees the corruption of the commercial world \( as in the heroine of the secret rapture \)
clive , iowa , feb 4 almost all the candidates for the republican presidential nomination have labored to cultivate this state s powerful christian conservatives but what once appeared a testament to those conservatives' strength may in the end weaken their voice in the caucuses here next monday conservative supporters are parceled out among several candidates , and that has created a vacuum for steve forbes , the multimillionaire publisher whose social views christian conservatives consider suspect , if not unacceptable that s a concern , ione dilley , the chairwoman of the iowa christian coalition , said today scattered forces are not as strong as those who are walking hand in hand the christian coalition is beginning to distribute thousands of voter guides detailing the candidates' views on issues like abortion at the grass roots , many voters still seem confused about the positions of some candidates , particularly those of mr forbes while the ads and the flat tax are propelling him right now , i do n't think most people know where he stands on other issues , tom allen , pastor of point of grace ministries here , said before services today mr allen , who has not yet picked a candidate , said he did not know mr forbes s social views knowing those views would be very important to me and i think to every christian , he said in 1988 , pat robertson surprised his republican opponents by finishing a strong second to bob dole here , because of the support of christian conservatives but this year , they do n't have all their money on one horse the way they did in '88 , said dennis goldford , a professor of political science at drake university beyond simply scattering the religious conservatives , the race for the nomination here could be an important measure of the role such voters will have in determining the republican party s agenda in the general election campaign while many candidates this year are courting the religious conservatives , only patrick j buchanan , the former commentator , and alan keyes , a former state department official , make opposition to abortion a key element of their stump speeches before all groups this whole abortion thing is a stain on the truth of america s existence , mr keyes thundered at point of grace ministries today and we will remove this stain from our land , or our freedom and our republic will die ! in addition to mr keyes , who so far has drawn only singledigit support in public opinion polls of likely caucusgoers , senator phil gramm of texas and mr buchanan are widely considered the top choices of conservatives while the christian coalition does not endorse a candidate , ms dilley personally endorsed senator dole , and he has been working to shore up support on the right mr dole , the frontrunner , flew into dubuque on saturday to declare that his first day in office as president would be american family day but while he inveighed against abortion in dubuque , a conservative stronghold , when he appeared only four hours later before voters in indianola , outside des moines , he did not mention abortion in his speech even in dubuque , mr dole declined to reassure religious conservatives that he would conform to their desires and pick an antiabortion running mate so far , christian conservatives say , the scattering of conservatives and the confusion over mr forbes have worked to his benefit but supporters of other candidates say that this week , campaign workers in telephone banks will be trying to point out to voters that mr forbes may not suit them this is where your county organization really comes into play , if you 've got people in the county making these advocacy calls , said dan boddicker , a state representative from tipton , in eastern iowa , who is supporting senator gramm he said callers would say things like , steve forbes might be a fiscal conservative , but have you thought about how moderate he is on other issues \? in recent days , mr forbes has tried to stake out clear positions on some social issues , for example declaring his opposition to samesex marriages but even that statement seems to leave some conservatives unsatisfied that s good , ms dilley said all he needs to do is get into it a little more and say why and will he support some kind of laws opposing such marriage none of the candidates appear to have raised more doubts in the minds of religious conservatives than mr forbes i'm afraid that he s a closet liberal , eric darling , a gramm backer and the owner of an electrical services business who attends point of grace , said of mr forbes if he got in office , you just do n't know what you 're going to get he s an extreme unknown photo bob dole , campaigning yesterday in dubuque , iowa , a conservativestronghold , spoke against abortion , but focused on other issues later \( jim wilson the new york times \)
what is the true measure of a yankee fan s devotion \? is it the willingness to bed down on a concrete mattress through a chilly night amid the snoring of beerbloated strangers \? or the mettle to court the wrath of spouses , parents or employers for the chance of a seat in the distant clouds of the upper deck \? by either yardstick , joseph ferrer must be judged worthy his girlfriend , due to deliver the couple s child at any moment , had forbidden him to camp out at yankee stadium in the line for tickets to the next round of the playoffs but he went nonetheless , with an upholstered desk chair and two packs of parliaments , to wait from 4 pm saturday to 9 am yesterday , the heady moment when 32 , 000 seats to two games went up for grabs i took a risk , said mr ferrer , 28 , of the bronx , referring not so much to his bid for tickets as to the possibility that he would miss his baby s birth by 11 am , he knew he had not , because he had finally summoned the nerve to call home and check i thought my girlfriend was going to kill me she was screaming and screaming , mr ferrer said but he wore a smile as he recounted this , and with good reason the fingers on his right hand curled around four coveted passports to box seats for wednesday s game the new york yankees have ascended to the american league championship series for the first time in 15 years , and that milestone was marked yesterday by a furious rush on tickets to the first two home games against the baltimore orioles tomorrow and wednesday as the sun scaled the sky , a jostling circle of bodies looped all the way around the stadium and out to the horizon the huddled masses included a few toddlers in strollers and a few disabled people in wheelchairs as fans unfolded their rickety lawn chairs , unfurled their raggedy blankets and showered cigarette butts and paper wrappers on the ground beneath them , the scene they created resembled nothing so much as a refugee camp , albeit with an unusually linear configuration for at least one day , said nelsy perez , 31 , of corona , queens , i empathize with the homeless according to the police , the crowd was 10 , 000 strong , and it was a decidedly happier lot than the one that descended on the stadium a little over a week ago for tickets to the yankees' home games against the texas rangers that time around , yankee officials announced only 15 minutes after the 30 , 186 tickets went on sale that there were none left the reason for the rapid sellout was the simultaneous distribution of tickets at three yankee clubhouse stores in manhattan and westchester and 185 ticketmaster outlets yankee officials later changed the system the 32 , 000 tickets being offered yesterday were available only at the stadium so even tardy pilgrims on the nether reaches of the line had cause for some optimism and despite heavy drinking , evident in the bloodshot eyes and empty beer cans that came into view with the morning light , they remained peaceful and patient it s much better this time much more organized , said gino dalesandro , 38 , of park slope , brooklyn , who added that there was shoving and screaming during the last ticket sale he camped out overnight then and netted a faraway perch in the bleachers he camped out again on saturday and landed box seats i feel redeemed , he said the line lurched forward all day long and into the evening by 6 30 pm , it had dwindled to about 50 , though newcomers kept trickling in to replenish it despite the ample ticket supply , there was still grumbling from people who had arrived before dawn , been told by police officers that they were undoubtedly too late and gone away , only to hear on the radio in the afternoon that there was reason to head back the box office closed at 8 pm , but was to reopen at 9 am today , still selling tickets for games 1 and 2 at 4 pm today , tickets for games 6 and 7 , which will be played in new york oct 15 and oct 16 if the series lasts that long , will go on sale only through ticketmaster phone service but for games 1 and 2 , fans began showing up at the stadium as early as 9 am saturday within hours after the yankees defeated the rangers about 5 pm saturday , the line outside yankee stadium swelled to about 3 , 000 people , many toting elaborate accommodations , provisions and diversions for the long , nippy night there were tents in a rainbow of colors from olive to hot pink , downfilled sleeping bags and portable grills there were boom boxes , batterypowered television sets , playing cards to shuffle and footballs to toss some people had shuffled on foot from only a few blocks away , while others had traveled hundreds of miles tim brecht , 26 , a transplanted yankee fan who attends a technical school in baltimore , had watched the yankees defeat the rangers in a bar there , then hopped in his car with a friend and drove three and a half hours to the stadium we did n't expect the line to be this long , he said some questioned their own sanity what kind of cuckoo clocks come out and sit in line for 13 hours \? asked ron hayeck sr , 51 , of succasunna , nj , who had committed to just such a wait the answer , in his case , was the kind who indulges his son ron hayeck jr , 25 , had dragged dad into it , selling the adventure as a special fatherandson moment although the line was quiet much of the time , segments of it occasionally burst into spontaneous yankee cheers , apropos of nothing but people s thirst for diversion by 8 30 am , the crowd had grown to 10 , 000 and everyone had snapped to attention , folding up their blankets , pressing closer to each other in a crush toward the ticket windows desiree perez , the first person in line , found herself mobbed by television cameras as she handed a crisp stack of 20 bills to a ticket seller the best available ! said ms perez , 24 , who is from the fordham section of the bronx and is not related to nelsy the best ! each person in line was limited to four tickets , whose prices ranged from 20 to 45 , and she ended up with four box seats behind home plate for tuesday s game so did nelsy perez box seats , baby , box seats ! she yelped in a highpitched voice as she bounced up and down like a pogo stick her squealing could still be heard long after she faded from view but not everyone experienced such glee far back in the line , jim mcgovern gave up at 11 am , unable to take the tedium any longer last night , it was ok , said mr mcgovern , 23 , of orange county , who had driven with friends to yankee stadium about 11 pm it was exciting , and i was drinking and drinking and drinking then i sobered up , and the voice of reason kicked in i thought 'who am i kidding \? this line is like 8 , 000 miles long ! ' mr mcgovern said he knew he still had a decent chance of nabbing tickets , but decided the sacrifice was too great all these people have been on line for 14 hours drinking beer , mr mcgovern said everyone s breath stinks the guy standing next to me i swear , he has n't showered in the last fiscal year when the guy next to him threw up , i said , 'that s it' photos twentyfourhours and a kiss later , desiree perez , the first person in line , and her fiance , david mendez , had their yankee tickets in hand \( steve hart for the new york times \) \( pg a1 \) about 10 , 000 fans , some of whom waited overnight , were in line yesterday morning at yankee stadium \( steve hart for the new york times \) \( pg b2 \)
nanjing his manner was friendly , but his words had a hard , metallic edge to them pardon me for speaking so bluntly , said liu junhai , a junior at nanjing university , pausing on a walk across the leafy campus to respond to a visitor s questions about student attitudes i do n't consider that the united states is very friendly toward china , he said after all , you have just sent two aircraft carriers to within a few hundred miles of the chinese coast and even closer to taiwan mr liu , 22 , is a business major , and he seemed all business as he explained himself in a way that reflected the strong patriotism some call it nationalism of chinese students today we have received a lot of propaganda from the central government that taiwan is part of china and the united states should not interfere in china s internal affairs , he said so it seems to me the role the us is playing as a world cop is comical it is none of your business , so why are you putting your foot in it \? again apologizing for the unfriendly tone of his remarks , mr liu added , we have a saying in chinese for something that seems out of place it is like the dog chasing the mouse mr liu s remarks and those of a number of his classmates sampled on an afternoon walk around one of china s most prestigious centers of higher learning suggested that just as americans are more inclined these days to think the worst about chinese intentions toward taiwan or in confrontations on trade and human rights , the chinese seem similarly inclined to think the worst of american intentions i do n't think the united states wants to see another soviet union in the world , in other words , another superpower or another country on its same level , said huang jie , a 20yearold german major hers was a grievance that many chinese voice today , a sense that behind washington s threats to impose trade sanctions on china for copyright piracy , behind its pressure on human rights , behind american and european objections to china s entry into the world trade organization is a strategy to contain china or to prevent its rise as a great asian power it almost seems out of place these days to speak of the friendly relations that marked the first 10 years of deng xiaoping s reforms , coinciding with mr deng s landmark visit to the united states in january 1979 that was the year that china s paramount leader visited the white house to reestablish full diplomatic relations before jetting off to tour america , even stopping in houston to wear a cowboy hat and ride in a rodeo at the astrodome i do n't think it is a question of being friendly or not , ms huang said nowadays , i think a country s relations with other countries are decided by economic interests not too many years ago , millions of chinese students , repelled by the corruption and inflation engendered by communist party policies , came out of their campuses to demand democratic reforms in the demonstrations of 1989 , leading to a violent military crackdown ordered by mr deng and carried out by a hardline faction led by prime minister li peng now , university students remain committed to these lofty concepts , but the emphasis has changed today , we are swimming in a different sea , said a legal scholar in beijing who explained that chinese students today are less inclined to place the blame for everything with the communist party or the government in beijing , and more likely to find fault with other forces in the world , particularly the united states when beijing went all out to win the contest to be named the host of the 2000 summer olympics , rightly or wrongly , many blamed the united states for china s failure i think china should first become stronger , said lei san , a 22yearold computer sciences major here then we can concentrate on building democracy in 1989 , when students filled tiananmen square in beijing and put up a statue that they called the goddess of democracy , mr lei was only 15 if there is no economic base , he continued , then there will be nothing to build democracy on ms huang added a different perspective the majority of students want to develop both economic and political reforms , she said , because people cannot live on bread alone one thing seemed clear from these youthful expressions the communist party leadership is benefiting from the wave of patriotic spirit or nationalism that is rolling through the student population not far from this campus , busloads of chinese schoolchildren arrive each day to tour the museum built in memory of the victims of the japanese 10th army in world war ii the invaders swept into this ancient city , whose name means southern capital in chinese , in november 1937 and began a campaign of rape , pillage and killing that left as many as 300 , 000 dead the museum director , zhu chengshan , said visits to the exhibition more than doubled in the last three years our purpose is to provide patriotic education for children and young people , and not to let them forget history as we strive to make the country stronger , he said mr zhu was assigned to the museum from the nanjing propaganda department in 1992 , the year that prime minister li issued national guidelines to enhance the patriotic education of china s youth , part of the concerted effort by communist party leaders in beijing after the tiananmen crackdown to win back legitimacy as well as the hearts and minds of students we intend to use patriotism as a unifying force because china needs stability , mr zhu said in some places , it appears to be working photo a heroic memorial on the campus of nanjing university seems tomirror the new patriotic mood of students , seven years after the unrest of 1989 \( patrick e tyler the new york times \)

love , again by doris lessing 352 pages harpercollins 24 the task doris lessing has set herself in love , again is a difficult one she has set out , like gabriel garcia marquez in love in the time of cholera , to create an anatomy of love , to make an inventory of love in all its forms young love , old love , lustful love , platonic love , love as an affliction and love as a hedge against mortality and despair the results , however , have none of the magic of mr garcia marquez s luminous novel , in large part because the story ms lessing has chosen to relate in love , again is unbelievable , inadvertently comical and clumsily rendered ms lessing asks us to believe that a 65yearold woman not only falls into a state of longing and lust , but that she also becomes the love object of several younger men , including a 40yearold movie star , a 35yearold director and a 26yearold stud so , who is this sexagenarian sex kitten \? ms lessing s typically omniscient narrator tells us that sarah durham is a founding member of a small london theater called the green bird her husband died when she was in her mid30 s her two children are grown and living far away as a young woman , we 're told , sarah had more than her share of boyfriends , but for the last 20 years has lived a quiet life devoid of the upheavals of romance everyone thinks of her as sensible sarah all this abruptly changes , however , when sarah begins work on a new play about the tragic life of a beautiful quadroon named julie vairon , who moved to france in the 1880 s , fell in love twice , was abandoned twice and eventually committed suicide as sarah embarks on a new production of julie vairon in france , her own love life , eerily , starts to mirror julie s sarah develops an intense friendship with her coauthor , stephen ellingtonsmith , a wealthy patron of the arts , who happens to be desperately in love with the long dead julie she develops a terrible crush on the beautiful young man , bill collins , who plays one of julie s lovers she learns that the play s other male lead , andrew stead , is desperate to go to bed with her and she falls passionately in love with the play s director , henry bisley , who reciprocates her feelings but is reluctant to cheat on his wife such improbable developments , ms lessing s narrator suggests , may be a result of julie vairon s strange , witchlike powers from beyond the grave , she has infected everyone with the madness of love sarah herself marvels at her predicament and thinks in a group of chimps , the senior female is sexually very popular ms lessing s prose does nothing to make sarah s entanglements more convincing gone is the wonderful psychological nuance displayed in the golden notebook and the martha quest novels in its place are characters who sound like walking volumes of bartlett s quotations , trading allusions to proust , goethe , stendhal , shakespeare and browning in place of conversation what s more , ms lessing describes these characters in embarrassing romancenovel cliches sarah , we 're told , feels her body bursting into flame when she thinks of bill her body had filled at once with a most horrible desire a reckless desire when she sees bill with a younger woman , pain sliced through her knives had nothing on this redhot skewers were more like it , or waves of fire she was dissolved in longing , ms lessing writes she could not remember ever feeling the rage of want that possessed her now surely never in her times of being in love had she felt this absolute , this peremptory need , an emptiness that hollowed out her body , as if life itself was being withheld from her ms lessing s penchant for writing about love in these panting , melodramatic terms has the effect of making her characters seem ridiculously selfpitying and selfabsorbed sarah babbles on about spending a season in hell she looks at her lovelorn friend stephen and thinks , this is the grief you see on the faces of survivors of catastrophes , staring back at you from the television screens of course , ms lessing s heroines have always tended to define themselves or discover their identity through their own problems and the problems of people they care for , and sarah is no exception her misadventures in love at the age of 65 propel her into a reexamination of her life and her desires in earlier lessing novels , such inventories of a heroine s self were rendered in meticulous emotional detail , and they were used as a kind of commentary on the society in which that heroine lived for some reason , this does not happen in love , again , and as a result the novel feels perfunctory and contrived , as well as implausible in the extreme photo \( ingrid von kruse \)
washington , sept 18 investigators from the national transportation safety board , saying they are convinced that none of the physical evidence recovered from twa flight 800 proves that a bomb brought down the plane , plan tests intended to show that the explosion could have been caused by a mechanical failure alone the investigators acknowledge that they have no evidence pointing to a mechanical malfunction rather , they say , the failure to find proof of a bombing , after more than two months , lends indirect credence to another theory , that an explosion in the boeing 747 s center fuel tank might have been been sufficient to destroy the plane if you get a fuelair explosion in that tank , how does it vent itself \? said a senior investigator who insisted he not be named how does the airplane open up \? that s what we have to come to grips with boeing , on the basis of its own calculations , has contended that there would not be sufficient energy in such an explosion to bring the plane down but safety board officials say they are unpersuaded they plan computer simulations and lab tests , and they may even try putting fuel in the center tank of a scrapped 747 and blowing it up james k kallstrom , the deputy director in charge of the federal bureau of investigation s new york office , said yesterday that the safety board tests of the center fuel tank do not reflect any new consensus among law enforcement investigators that a malfunction destroyed the plane they should do all the tests in the world to try to ascertain what caused this , mr kallstrom said just as we should do , from the standpoint of our bomb technicians and forensic people those procedures are complimentary to each other , and they have been done simultaneously all the investigators have their own private hunches about the most likely cause of the crash , he added and mr kallstrom acknowledged that ntsb investigators , unlike most federal law enforcement officials , place more credence in the malfunction theory behind the different approaches is a growing sense of surprise and frustration that proof of the cause of the crash still has not been found , even though more than 100 divers have been in the water nearly every day since the crash on july 17 the fbi and the safety board have different missions that lead them to favor different theories on the fbi side , there is a grim determination to catch the criminals responsible , presuming they exist , for a crash that killed all 230 passengers and crew meanwhile , the aviation experts want to make sure they are not overlooking a mechanical flaw that , if it exists , could threaten hundreds of other boeing 747 s and they are anxious to keep control of the investigation the safety board remains in charge unless the fbi declares the crash to be a criminal act at the safety board , a senior official said that it would be incorrect to imply that there is conflict between his agency and the fbi over this approach the safety board s investigators say they believe that not even the metal parts that bear microscopic traces of explosive residue prove that a bomb was involved in fact , a senior ntsb official said , if there was a bomb , investigators probably would have seen classic signs of it by now , including metal that is pitted and bent by highenergy shock waves likewise , he said , the fact that they have not found any parts of a missile puts that theory in more doubt as a result , several safety board officials said , the board plans to run tests on other boeing 747 s in commercial service to see if investigators can find levels of plastic explosive similar to the tiny samples the fbi found in the flight 800 wreckage explosives experts say traces are common in public spaces where people who work with explosives have been present but the ntsb s central question is whether the 50 to 100 gallons of jet fuel sloshing around in the 12 , 800gallon center tank , located in the lower part of the fuselage where the wings come together , would have enough energy to do all the damage they have observed on parts now in hangars in calverton , li the fbi s strong belief that a bomb caused the crash is based on these pieces of circumstantial evidence the plane s flight data recorder did not contain even a hint of an impending mechanical calamity , the jetliner split in two in a pattern remarkably similar to that of other 747 s that were bombed out of the sky and forensic tests of the wreckage confirmed traces of two chemical ingredients of semtex , a favorite explosive of terrorists the safety board officials acknowledge all of that some even say that it still looks , on a circumstantial basis , like a bomb but the agency s top officials say that on the basis of their experience the center fuel tank explosion could produce the same set of facts the new analysis is a sign that an understanding of the crash is still evolving a month ago , some investigators thought that because parts of the tank showed no blast damage , it had not exploded the thinking now is that an explosion in the tank would punch a hole in it somewhere , rather than blowing the tank apart , and engineers will need to know how big a hole , and where , and what consequences would follow the safety board intends to continue working closely with the fbi and the navy retrieving wreckage from the ocean floor for the remaining weeks of the dive season , probably until the end of october between now and then , they are considering seeking second opinions from underwater experts on the scanning work done so far this could include using outside experts to review sonar logs , to assure that there are no objects on the bottom that were missed in the first searches , and might include new scans demonstrating that the crash could have occurred simply from a fuel tank explosion would not prove that that happened in fact , it would leave open the major question of what could ignite the tank investigators have several theories but no evidence for a mechanical ignition source according to safety board experts , the vapor in the tank could be set off by a spark so small that it would not be visible to the human eye in daylight a possible source is the wiring in the fuelmonitoring system but getting such a spark requires two separate failures a break in the insulation of the wiring , and a failure in a part that is supposed to limit the energy in those wires to a quantity 10 times too small to make the necessary spark the tank also has three fuel pumps , but their wiring is outside the tank engineers are studying whether the pumps could somehow conduct current into the tank where it could cause a spark so far , they have found only two pumps the safety board investigators stress that they still do not know what made the plane crash they add that their planned analysis , which will probably last into midwinter , could end up showing the opposite that burned , bent parts already in hand could not have been produced by a fuel tank explosion alone it is also possible , they say , that a diver could raise a part tomorrow that would unambiguously show bomb damage according to executives in the aviation industry , the safety board has already begun asking around about the availability of a scrapped , but intact , 747 fuselage for an experimental explosion of the center fuel tank a spokesman for boeing , russell d young , said that if tests were planned to see if the center fuel tank could cause all the damage , it would be an effort by the safety board to advance the investigation to the level where you do n't leave anything to the imagination
cigar made a noble but losing farewell to racing in new york yesterday when he was beaten by a head by skip away in the 1 million jockey club gold cup it was only the second time in his last 19 races that the 6yearold super horse had been outrun , but it also was the second time in his last three starts so , age , luck and fast horses may be catching up to him he gave it a special poignancy by staging a valiant rally through the homestretch , but missed by the length of skip away s head and while it took two horses to spring the trap that ended cigar s 16race winning streak at del mar in august , this time it took just one very swift , very tough 3yearold as they streaked to the finish , skip away was fighting on the inside to keep his lead and cigar was charging on the outside to snatch it and flying at their heels came two other 3yearold stars , louis quatorze , two lengths behind cigar , and editor s note , one length behind louis quatorze i 'd just be whining if i made excuses , said bill mott , who trains cigar for allen paulson of california i do n't feel uncomfortable about anything that s happened i thought he ran a pretty darned good race he had a little more left to do at the halfmile pole than he normally has to , but that does n't mean we 're making excuses jerry bailey , who rode cigar through his recordtying winning streak , put it bluntly i ran second i ran into a horse who ran an exceptional race i have to tip my hat to the winner i knew it was going to be tough coming home i give him the cue , and he usually responds today , when i asked him to run , he struggled but he never gave up will they meet again in a return match at the breeders' cup in toronto on oct 26 \? it will be cigar s final race before he retires to the life of a stallion but skip away , owned by carolyn hine and trained by her husband , sonny hine , was not nominated when he was born so , his owner would have to pay a supplemental fee to enter him in the breeders' cup classic 12 percent of the purse of 4 million , or 480 , 000 , for a shot at the winner s prize of about 21 million i wo n't say he is n't going to the breeders' cup , sonny hine said but i do n't know what we would gain some people i train for have offered to put up the money to go to the breeders' cup i think it s a bad gamble , but they do n't we 'll see how he pulls up , and go back to kentucky , he said , sounding like a man who wanted to have his arm twisted anything can happen the colt who outran the great cigar has been racing every landmark race , including the triple crown he ran 12th in the kentucky derby , but won the blue grass in record time , ran second in the preakness , second in the belmont , first in the ohio derby , first in the haskell , third in the travers and first in the woodbine million by the time he reached the gold cup , he was installed as second choice to cigar , and he went off at almost 61 with a rich record and worlds to conquer as expected , the pace was set by louis quatorze , the winner of the preakness , trained by nick zito but it was a slow pace they ran the first quarter of a mile in 24 seconds , the halfmile in 473 5 skip away ran second , step by step cigar ran third , easily , confidently but bailey , who pressed the speedy siphon at del mar , may have waited too long to press the leaders at belmont park by the time they entered the homestretch , skip away had replaced louis quatorze in first place and then , there came the mighty cigar , making his move but when he did , skip away still had plenty of strength left to deliver because the pace had been so moderate and when the real race began , the race down the stretch , cigar was chasing a relatively fresh horse it was a fairly leisurely pace for horses of that caliber , mott said if we had to go back and do it over again , maybe jerry would place him closer but you ca n't go back i do n't feel like he did n't run his race i do n't feel like jerry did a bad job riding him , or that i did a bad job training him skip away ran the mile and a quarter in 2 002 5 under shane sellers , paid 1360 to his backers and earned 600 , 000 for carolyn hine her husband shrugged afterward , and said , as any trainer might she pays 10 percent the stage for the gold cup was set elaborately by a cluster of three other stakes on an extravagant day of racing at belmont booked as the breeders' cup preview weekend it featured allstar casts searching for titles with four more stakes scheduled for today but if people were looking for clues to next year s triple crown , they found confusion instead the 125th running of the champagne stakes , a traditional milestone on the road to the kentucky derby , was won by ordway with the favored traitor second and gold tribute third ordway , a son of salt lake , owned by william punk and philip dileo , seized the lead in the homestretch and held it against a determined move by traitor , who became the derby favorite by winning the futurity three weeks ago he is trained by david donk , he paid 17 for a 2 bet and he earned 240 , 000 from the purse of 400 , 000 traitor , owned by 84yearold alfred gwynn vanderbilt , one of the pillars of new york racing , remained very much in the picture as the juveniles raced toward the wars of 1997 but his trainer , mary eppler , said he wo n't be going to the breeders' cup we 'll put him away , and get him ready for next year in the 175 , 000 kelso , four horses jammed their way into the photo at the finish , but the longshot same old wish was in front by a whisker he is a 6yearold owned by the friendship stable , which made many friends when the 341 outsider poked his neck in front to edge out the favorite , da hoss , who in turn beat out volochine by a neck , and volochine beat out dowty by a head for third next came the 500 , 000 turf classic invitational with at least three star runners from europe but none of them could catch diplomatic jet as he flashed home in the stretch , less than a length in front of awad with marlin third the winner , who took the man o'war at belmont three weeks ago , is trained by jimmy picou and owned by fred hooper , who turns 99 years of age today photos the jubilant jockey shane sellers raising his crop high yesterday after his horse skip away defeated the favored cigar , right , ridden by jerry bailey the trainer bill mott , left , talking with the jockey jerry bailey after cigar placed second \( photographs by steve berman for the new york times \) \( pg 3 \)
once again the knicks are faced with the daunting task of crossing the river jordan new york trails chicago , two games to none , in a fourofsevengame playoff matchup that is much too bitter to be called a rivalry this is a feud like a pair of starcrossed lovers locked in a fatal embrace , the knicks and the bulls have enmity that is in the blood chicago s head coach , phil jackson , played for the knicks during the 60 s and 70 s jim cleamons , a chicago assistant , played for them during the late 70 s in 1988 , with chicago on the verge of greatness , the bulls traded charles oakley to the knicks for bill cartwright , who had been relegated to backing up patrick ewing at center cartwright earned three championship rings , leaving ewing and oakley to chase the rapidly setting sun i think that s where it started , said derek harper , who joined the knicks in 1994 i remember watching them play , and you could tell then there was something deeper going on my wife is from chicago she was always trying to get me to go to a chicagonew york game that stadium was so hard to play in there was always a crazy energy there crazy , indeed there was the bizarre spectacle tuesday night in game 2 of ewing going after cleamons in the fourth quarter yesterday , cleamons was fined 2 , 500 for initiating the confrontation there were a number of smaller brush fires among players finally , in a recreation of the ego feuds between jackson and pat riley , jackson and jeff van gundy , riley s successor , are taking shots at each other van gundy chided jackson for a lack of professionalism jackson blamed van gundy s substitution patterns for the knicks' fourthquarter fizzles in both games van gundy called chicago s ron harper motormouth and said the bulls do a lot more talking now that they have michael jordan back than they did when big brother was away you got 23 , you can say whatever you want , van gundy said he can back it up anthony mason referred to the bulls' frequent taunting as poison tactics the bulls say the knicks are whining the bulls are eager the knicks are clearly frustrated so far , the river jordan has been too deep , too wide for the knicks to cross in 1989 the knicks lost to the bulls , 42 , in the eastern conference semifinals in 1991 the knicks were swept by them , 30 , in the first round in 1992 the knicks lost to them , 43 , in the conference semis and in 1993 they lost to them again , 42 , in the conference finals the knicks finally got by them in 1994 but jordan was n't there he was retired , playing baseball now the knicks must win four of the next five games from a team that has lost 10 games all season i know a lot of our fans are thinking , win one game and we 'll be satisfied , van gundy said we think we can win the championship the knicks' thread of hope is that they played well enough to win in games 1 and 2 of this series but stumbled in the fourth quarter of both games of course , the reason for the knicks' fourthquarter tumbles is that chicago choked the life out of their offense on thursday , when the national basketball association announced its alldefensive team , it was no coincidence that jordan , dennis rodman and scottie pippen were named new york s hope is to exploit the bulls in the middle it has n't happened the knicks fell short in games 1 and 2 when chicago s superstar came through new york s lone star did not on thursday , van gundy issued the challenge for ewing to be a more dominant presence he called on the guards to give ewing the ball in better position and said they had to work harder to get open shots for themselves we do n't have to play a perfect game to beat chicago , van gundy added just a solid game there are a lot of holes to plug in this dike are the knicks a couple players away , or do they need a complete overhaul \? and does that reality change whether the knicks lose the next two games or win four of the next five \? after practice yesterday , ernie grunfeld , the general manager , said the team has a plan and a vision larger than one playoff series but this really is n't the time for that , grunfeld said the only thing we 're focusing on is this series right here in front of us the real river jordan empties into the dead sea what fitting imagery photo phil jackson \( associated press \)

in the racial climate of 1996 , these marchers say , standing still is the same as lying down it s not fair , mr parker said of an executive order , issued by mr foster last month , to end race and sexbased preferences in state hiring and contracting among those programs over which the governor has control it s not right then mr parker walked on this was not a million man march , only a symbolic local reaction to an act that was in itself largely symbolic the governor s executive order has no effect on programs that are protected by louisiana or federal law , and those programs account for most of the state s affirmative action operations parading by the small wooden houses of blacks who live by the river , the marchers motioned for the onlookers to come along most of those watching waved back , and one man cheered , but none fell in step indeed , as the marchers made their way through mount airy on thursday , the day after they had set out from new orleans , they numbered only about 20 , all of them from the starting point , walking toward the state capitol in baton rouge and a protest there on saturday the marchers joined about 6 , 000 protesters at the baton rouge rally , the associated press reported , while about 175 counterdemonstrating whites gathered about 12 blocks from the capitol there were no reports of confrontation between the two groups the counterdemonstration was organized by the national association for the advancement of white people , founded by david duke , a former leader of the ku klux klan mr duke , who is running for the united states senate from louisiana , addressed the crowd , asserting that affirmative action discriminates against whites some marchers said their small number was not important others were disappointed , but none would concede that the era of the grassroots protest had passed that method , they said , even in a modern age of emailed press releases and faxed declarations of outrage , is the best way to bring issues of race into hearts and living rooms , since you have to believe in something badly to blister your feet and history has proved that if even only a few people come out to sweat and sing , reporters will sooner or later be on them like a duck on a june bug i wish there had been more people , said avery c alexander , a state representative from new orleans who is a 30year veteran of civil rights marches but when you talk to someone in the year 2030 , there will be a million people who will say they were here one difficulty in getting people out might be that the issues have become more subtle mr alexander , who is in his 80 s , marched for the first time when louisiana wanted to do away with free milk for babies in the 1960 s this is little different , he said , and to pretend otherwise is the greatest lie ever told forty years ago we were struggling for something with great resolve , said pat bryant , an organizer of the trek who rode ahead of the marchers in his car , keeping watch for trouble , guiding them now we are struggling to retain what we won if times have indeed changed since the 1960 s , said mr bryant , in one way nothing has we see the very same forces who tried to marginalize us before , he said , only with different tactics now mr foster , a republican , announced his executive order while also declaring a state holiday for the rev dr martin luther king jr the governor said he believed that dr king would have supported him he just wanted an end to all discrimination based on color , mr foster said mr bryant said the cause was simpler 40 years ago , when he was baptized into the civil rights movement as a child , trying to integrate the swimming pool at morrow mountain state park in north carolina his father was a carolina minister who marched in the early civil rights days he showed me how to be a man , said mr bryant , who now lives in new orleans and is executive director of gulf coast tenants , a group that battles inequality in housing and other services his father also showed him the value of the march as a tool , and mr bryant said the tool still worked blacks have used economic boycotts and other weapons to fight racism , he said , and it may take a black economic boycott of louisiana to make mr foster retreat but there will always be marches as the spiritual backbone of the effort , he said although it may have been dwarfed in size by civil rights marches of the past , the new orleanstobaton rouge march mirrored them in many ways the marchers were fed along the way by churches , which also provided them places to sleep they moved to the sound of spirituals and they carried simple homemade signs that demanded fairness behind them , moving at a crawl , was a short caravan of cars with window signs that said , join us it gets hot in this part of louisiana , even in february , and the sweat rolled off the marchers among them was a cadre of middleaged men who for 50 miles carried a paper banner , four abreast , and never tore it once where else can black people be , said mr bryant , but marching \? photo state representative avery c alexander , top left , marched tobaton rouge , la , and was

when detective arthur masinski and his partner , thomas bellino , gave chase to four men who were fighting with baseball bats on staten island last month , neither knew where the case would lead the men fled in a sport utility vehicle , but were captured a few blocks away none of them confessed to being the owner of the vehicle , and for good reason the real owner was john f kennedy jr using a hidden vehicle identification number , the police determined that the vehicle , a typhoon , was reported stolen from mr kennedy s neighborhood , tribeca , in march 1993 the man caught driving the vehicle , mark capichana , 29 , of bensonhurst , brooklyn , surrendered yesterday and was charged with possession of a stolen property through his personal assistant , rosemarie terenzio , mr kennedy , 36 , said he had no comment richard asher , a spokesman for pontiacgmc division of the general motors corporation , said there are only about 4 , 500 such vehicles nationwide , as the typhoon model was discontinued after 1993
los angeles , april 1 the los angeles county district attorney s office , expressing concern over accusations of jury tampering in the o j simpson murder trial , is looking into whether an anonymous letter that resulted in the dismissal of a juror was fabricated the juror , francine floriobunten , was dismissed last may by judge lance a ito after he received a fivepage letter written by someone who identified herself only as a receptionist at a los angeles literary agency it asserted that a juror matching ms floriobunten s description about 40 years old and white was planning to write a book about the case and that her husband had approached the agency it is obvious to me that this woman and her husband came to a conclusion of mr simpson s guilt and sold the book with that agreement , the anonymous informer wrote on may 12 since her dismissal , ms floriobunten , a 39yearold telephone worker , has steadfastly denied that she ever considered writing a book , maintaining that the mysterious letter was an act of sabotage neither judge ito nor the prosecutor s office investigated the source of the letter during the trial sandi gibbons , a spokeswoman for the district attorney s office , said today at this time we 've received information and are looking at the information we will review it to determine whether we need to open an investigation she declined to comment further mr simpson was acquitted of charges that he murdered his former wife , nicole brown simpson , and her friend ronald l goldman even if prosecutors find that jury tampering took place , he cannot be retried because of constitutional protections against double jeopardy but the accusations of behindthescenes machinations , which prosecutors had complained about but not proved during mr simpson s trial , could affect the wrongfuldeath lawsuit filed against him by the victims' families if it could be proved that mr simpson knew about tampering in the criminal trial , that could diminish his credibility in the civil case , said stephen yagman , a santa monica civil rights lawyer who specializes in wrongfuldeath lawsuits much of the information prosecutors are examining was apparently developed during an investigation by the cbs television program 60 minutes , which reported its findings on sunday night the 60 minutes report supported ms floriobunten s view of the incident and implied that mr simpson s defense team may have been involved in the letter s fabrication today larry r feldman , a santa monica lawyer who represents two of mr simpson s lawyers , johnnie l cochran jr and robert l shapiro , said the letter certainly appears to be suspicious , and both mr cochran and mr shapiro welcome a complete and thorough investigation they both categorically and unequivocally deny any attempt to influence or tamper with the jury according to 60 minutes , the letter said the unidentified agent had negotiated with ms floriobunten s husband for a book that the juror would write called standing alone a verdict for nicole the letterwriter said she was a 20yearold whose family lived in germany during world war ii but 60 minutes said that among 58 literary agencies in los angeles , it could find no receptionist fitting that description none of the agencies said they had had contact with ms floriobunten or her husband at the time the accusations were made , judge ito consulted prosecutors and defense lawyers , and then questioned the jurors to determine whether they had heard about a possible floriobunten book deal according to court transcripts of those interviews , as word of the investigation spread among panelists , another juror , farron chavarria , passed a warning note to ms floriobunten yet a third juror told the judge that she saw ms floriobunten reading a newspaper on which ms chavarria had scribbled when judge ito questioned ms floriobunten directly , she denied involvement in a book deal and said she had never seen a note alerting her to judge ito s investigation the judge later told lawyers during a closeddoor hearing that ms floriobunten had outandout lied about this communication eleven days later , on june 5 , judge ito dismissed ms chavarria ms floriobunten later told reporters that she recalled seeing something scribbled on a crumpled page of the wall street journal but that she had not read it during her tenure on the panel , ms floriobunten became the subject of intense outofcourt speculation after another dismissed juror , jeannette harris , said that she was among the white members who had racially polarized the panel photo an anonymous letter cost francine floriobunten her seat on the o j simpson jury last may \( reuters \)
philadelphia , march 9 it was a most disheartening experience for the temple owls they stood toe to toe with massachusetts , ranked no 2 in the nation , in the atlantic 10 tournament championship game at the civic center tonight , hit umass with their best shot , and the minutemen did n't flinch instead , umass weathered a furious temple rally at the start of the second half , then bombarded the owls from long range to defeat temple , 7561 it was the fourth consecutive time temple \( 1912 \) had lost to umass in the a10 tournament final and the minutemen s fifth consecutive tournament championship it was also the perfect launching pad for the minutemen s run at the national collegiate athletic association basketball championship they are sure to be given a no 1 seeding in the tournament with the victory the minutemen improved to 311 and set a school record for the most victories in a season umass also became only the second school in ncaa history to win five straight outright league regularseason and tournament titles north carolina state , which won the southern conference regular season title from 194751 and the tournament championship from 194752 , is the only other team to have done it umass coach john calipari was underwhelmed by the accomplishment it s one of those things i 'll enjoy 20 years from now , calipari said i did n't even mention it in the postgame we want to win a national title all the other things that happen along the way are byproducts calipari made it sound as if the victory against temple was so much cereal filler in dog food however , it may have sent a wakeup call that the minutemen needed before getting into the ncaa tournament had it not been for guard carmelo travieso s 3point shooting prowess , the minutemen might have been sunk temple controlled the lane with forward marc jackson scoring 24 points and pulling down 9 rebounds , but they had no answer for travieso , who had a gamehigh 21 points he got it by hitting 7 of 13 attempts from 3point range whenever the minutemen sagged , travieso , who was voted tournament most valuable player , was there to pick them up with a bomb from outside he had tied a school record with eight 3pointers the last time the minutemen played temple umass center marcus camby , who scored 12 points and had 6 rebounds , did n't come alive until the last 10 minutes of the game three of camby s five blocked shots came during a fourminute stretch when the minutemen went from being down , 4441 , to going up , 5446 that s what we expect him to do all the time , calipari said he s a shot blocker he can leave his man and go get it offensively , we 've got to get him more involved temple coach john chaney , who again lamented the fact that outside of levan alston his guards are substandard , saw too much of travieso and camby when you look at the people they have they look like the noname gang , chaney said until you get out there and they 're bluechippers travieso is a great player camby is easily the best player in the country , bar none he added they hit 10 of 17 threes and they were way out they had an answer for our defense when most people do n't have an answer temple fell behind by 3530 at the half when travieso hit a 3pointer with 16 seconds to play in the first period the owls came roaring back during the first six minutes of the second half on the strength of 7 straight points by jackson and took a 3938 lead their first of the game on a layup by center william cunningham with 16 minutes 2 seconds to go the owls extended the lead to 4438 on a three pointer by forward lynard stewart with 14 54 to play umass called a timeout calipari and tyrone weeks got into a heated exchange , and weeks also screamed at several of his teammates all i said to him was do n't get upset with me if you 're frustrated with yourself , calipari said whatever else was said ignited a fire under umass camby went on a shotblocking tear , the minutemen fired up and made five 3pointers and they went up , 5848 , on a free throw by weeks with 7 54 to play the owls were spent at that point we can do what we do , but we ca n't do it for 40 minutes against great teams like umass and kentucky , chaney said maybe we could get five bibles , throw them on the floor and hope the other players pick them up and read them
mountain view , calif , sept 30 emitting highspeed streams of campaign oratory meant to fan the irritation that many in the hightechnology industry feel toward president clinton , jack kemp came courting in silicon valley today , pushing the dole candidacy s promises of lower taxes and entrepreneurfriendly government speaking here at the headquarters of netscape , the internet software company , mr kemp praised the innovative , competitive spirit that fuels this swath of technology companies , and promised rules and laws that would help it continue to boom and in a telephone call from florida , amplified for the tshirted engineers and suited executives gathered in netscape s parking lot , bob dole himself promised to be on silicon valley s side those pledges were aimed at several moves that mr clinton , who won election four years ago with the technology industry s help , has made since taking office , particularly his veto later overridden of a bill making it harder for shareholders disappointed by a drop in stock price to sue company executives but the issue that made jim barksdale , the chief executive of netscape , endorse mr dole last week and welcome mr kemp today was the problem that technology companies are having getting the federal government to ease export restrictions on encryption technology it puts us in the awkward position of losing tens of millions of dollars a year in sales because of an antiquated restriction on our software , mr barksdale said in an interview after mr kemp s talk here it s as if the information superhighway is getting a roadblock about 10 yards after you get on the ramp mr barksdale is among more than 200 silicon valley executives who have endorsed the dolekemp ticket , which received another lift today when the chief executive of oracle , larry ellison , met mr kemp at a technologyoriented public school to demonstrate the network computer , a cheap , laptopsized computer meant to hook up every student and teacher in a school system to the internet and to one another \( mr ellison did say afterward , though , that he considered the school event bipartisan and that his attendance there was not a dole endorsement \) for all the pique at mr clinton , silicon valley has customarily voted democratic and is expected to do so again this year ken khachigian , a top dole adviser in california , said the silicon valley campaigning was aimed at shaving points from the clinton margin in the state as a whole rather than winning over a majority of the valley s voters the democratic leaning helped explain a certain lack of enthusiasm among many of the 20something engineers and programmers at netscape , who occasionally applauded mr kemp but without the cheers and shouts of a typical political rally people around the bay area are pretty liberal , said phil peterson , an engineer , so there was some testy response to the endorsement by mr barksdale but none of this did anything to dim the enthusiasm emanating from mr kemp , an idea lover who seemed in his element in this intellectdriven territory silicon valley proves that the ultimate source of wealth is not land , labor or capital , as important as they are , he said at netscape the greatest source of wealth is the mind the pitches that he and mr dole made to the gathered workers included the ticket s proposal to cut the capital gains tax in half , a matter of particular appeal to the venturecapitaldependent startup companies that occasionally strike it rich here mr dole and mr kemp both accused mr clinton of pandering to special interests by vetoing the bill restricting shareholder lawsuits although congress overrode that veto , a current california ballot initiative would allow more leeway for such suits within the state on recent visits to california meant in part , it has seemed , to mend his relations with the barons of silicon valley mr clinton has come out against that ballot initiative that is not enough for some executives , however it s hard to name things the current administration has done for this valley over the last four years aside from visit it and talk about it , said floyd kvamme , a venture capitalist who helped organize mr kemp s visit and we need action from washington photo on a campaign visit to netscape headquarters in mountain view , calif , jack kemp took a look yesterday at a notebook listing more than 200 silicon valley executives who have endorsed the dolekemp ticket \( jim wilson the new york times \)
washington , nov 13 they crouched in makeshift booths in dank , secret parts of wartime england , poring over the coded radio traffic flowing from the commanders of nazi germany with some brilliant coups , and much plodding labor , the british codebreakers tracked the progress of the german army on its march across europe then came the summer of 1941 and the german invasion of the soviet union now the content of the coded messages used by the german commanders of the ss and police units that followed the frontline troops was shockingly different from routine intelligence about troop movements july 18 1 , 153 jewish looters shot aug 27 regiment south shot 914 jews the special action staff with police battalion 320 shot 4 , 200 jews aug 31 2 , 200 jews shot those messages , many historians now believe , were a shorthand about the beginnings of the holocaust but in a striking display of official secretiveness , only in recent days have the contents of the radio intercepts finally been made public in washington for historians and holocaust researchers , they provide a clue to one of the vital missing links of the history of the era who in the west knew at the time that genocide was beginning \? what is perfectly clear is that british intelligence had absolutely definite information , not about all of europe , but certainly about occupied parts of the soviet union , prof richard breitman said mr breitman , a historian at american university here , was among a group of american scholars who requested the declassification of 13 million wartime documents from the national security agency under the freedom of information act the agency , which was created after the war , released the documents to the national archives professor breitman said in a recent interview that 282 pages of radio intercepts from ss and police commanders in belarus and ukraine were among the documents taken together with earlier british research , he said , they establish that the british knew that jews were being targeted for atrocities as early as september 1941 more than a year before britain or the united states publicly acknowledged the plight of the european jews even before the german invasion of the soviet union , polish resistance and jewish groups had been telling britain and its allies of atrocities against civilians in occupied poland by late 1941 , professor breitman said , the british knew a lot about the shootings in the soviet union and had concluded that it was perfectly obvious that the nazis were executing every jew they could lay hands on although britain and the united states shared intelligence during the war , it remains unclear when the british passed on this information , including copies of the documents , to the americans , who entered the war in december 1941 after the japanese attack on pearl harbor the documents reaffirm that in the wartime german hierarchy , responsibility for the mass killing of jews lay not only with elite ss units , but also with municipal police units the order police supposedly drawn from less fanatical germans the disclosure , moreover , raises the troubling question of why the transcripts , still classified in britain , were not released earlier to assist in the prosecution of war criminals the documents have opened a new fault line among historians of the nazi era in the united states , britain and germany over questions relating to the very definition of the nazi genocide and the allied response to it is it reasonable , half a century later , to assume that the british codebreakers would extrapolate from the messages that nazi germany planned the destruction of the european jews \? and , if allied intelligence had drawn that conclusion , why was the beginning of the holocaust the object of a coverup \? the transcripts draw a chilling picture of events from july to august 1941 , as german ss and police units moved through the soviet union , chronicling their achievements with a blend of precision and horror , at once terse and boastful explosive reports of nazi killings on aug 4 , 1941 , for example , a german commander reported up until aug 3 , ss cavalry brigade liquidated 3 , 274 partisans and jewish bolshevists own losses none even at that time , the transcripts were evidently viewed as so explosive that british intelligence analysts marked them to be kept under lock and key never to be removed from the office significantly , though , the flow of detailed information relating to atrocities was interrupted on sept 13 , 1941 , with a coded order from berlin on the same network that all future reference to executions be delivered by courier , not by a radio system vulnerable to interception from now on , the message from kurt daluge , commander of the order police in berlin , insisted , executions should be treated as most secret matters of the reich that order itself , decoded on oct 9 , 1941 , provided ample evidence that the germans themselves attached such importance to the atrocities as to classify them alongside the highest state secrets
silk stories by grace dane mazur 237 pp lumen editions , box 1047 , cambridge , mass 02238 paper , 1595 sexual awakening is surely among the most difficult of subjects in fiction by the time you are grown up enough to write about it , you 've lost the perspective you once saw it from , to say nothing of the particulars grace dane mazur , in the first story of silk , gives us as fresh a rendering of a young woman s coming of age as any i 've read or read lately , at least she is good , too , at mapping out the complex geography of family life , calling up with convincing detail what it s like to be a child doing the hard work of sorting through the inscrutabilities of adult behavior some of the mysteries that cass , the child in question , encounters are easily comprehensible to a more experienced eye there s a mattress in the basement that moves perplexingly from place to place in the cellar she likes to play in , always coming to rest in the room with a lock on the door but there are also some inscrutables that would be fairly peculiar by any measure aunt marika goes out into the woods , hitches up her skirts \( to reveal that she does n't wear underwear \) , walks out onto the branch of a willow tree and dips her buttocks into very cold water , swaying back and forth , humming to herself it s never clear whether aunt marika sees her 10yearold niece watching from her hiding place in the bushes , but if she does , she does n't let on this odd little ritual , incredibly enough , is repeated every day soon , cass is jumping naked into the water herself and beginning to mentally undress the other members of her family at the dinner table her mother , arriving just in time for the soup , prompts this reflection she too had a body , now , under her dress , and my mind stripped her as she walked , with the stiffness of new sadness , to her chair cass imagines her father , dark and hairy and surprising under the table , and her teenage cousins , seated at the end of the table , are transmogrified into a raucous heap , teeming with breasts and thighs and legs , testicles and penises this skates perilously close to the ridiculous , but it does n't read that way in the context of the story part of the reason is that cass s perceptions are grounded in other narrative preoccupations she shows other characters dealing with the consequences of death , drawing boundaries , keeping secrets , dissolving a marriage ms mazur builds her story with such assured precision , layering color and texture , finely balancing showing and telling , that we are thoroughly on her side by the time we get to this semicomical climax the characters introduced in this first story reappear in different guises throughout the interwoven narratives that make up the first half by far the better half of the book one of the subjects ms mazur deals with most interestingly through her shifting group portrait is the radical operation of time on perspective when we next see cass , she is 22 , staying at her aunt marika s apartment in paris , sitting for her portrait the intuitive kinship she once felt for her exotic aunt has been replaced by a cool mistrust living with her now , she finds her aunt surprisingly and intractably foreign cass retrieves her earlier feeling by a strangely circuitous route , falling into an affair with marika s lover , a polish emigre named stasek the climax , once again , is precipitated by a howler of a dinnertable scene , in which stasek shows cass how to hide the raw pig fat aunt marika s crazy friend is urging upon her poaching her aunt s lover is only the beginning of the liberties cass takes with her relatives , however within a few short pages she is sliding into bed with her own brother , thomas none of these couplings is in the least premeditated they seem merely to metabolize , independently of will or volition the catalyst in the case of thomas is an obscenely large thorny fruit from malaysia , more reptilian than vegetal , like the egg a dinosaur might lay unable to think of an appropriate birthday present , cass buys the fruit from a vietnamese grocery , mistakenly understanding its name to be de rien \( of nothing \) her brother , delighted with the gift , explains that it is called durian , and requires ripening there is a stretch of nine hours when the taste of this kind of durian is at its peak before that , it s sour , and after , it s fermented when the dangerous fruit finally comes into its own , it proves to be of decidedly mixed character smelling powerfully of swamp , but endowed with the heavenly taste of peaches and almonds the flesh is so divinely sensual that it felt forbidden to be fingering it ms mazur is clearly revisiting the garden of eden here , but with a modern twist there are no consequences \( not consequences , at least , as the old testament would have defined them \) thomas and cass go on sleeping together for a year , until she gets pregnant , has an abortion and discovers that she has fallen in love with someone else in a brief aside , she mentions feeling guilty , but there s not much evidence elsewhere in the story \( or stories , since the narrative covers more than one of them \) to support this what grace dane mazur means to suggest , here and elsewhere in the stories of silk , is that connections between people have a life of their own , doggedly pursuing their own mysterious trajectory the skillful marshaling of sensuous detail is intended to emphasize the strong connection to nature this is what happens when we follow our instincts , silk seems to assert the question lurking behind these stories might be framed thus what happens if we jettison all givens and allow nature to take its course , letting the senses come first \? it s a question that has been asked before , and since the 1960 s we 've seen some of the consequences of trying it out few of these are acknowledged here , however i ca n't help feeling that there is a large degree of selfishness in the odd insouciance that many of ms mazur s heroines affect and despite the interesting writing and delightfully entertaining comic moments , i am grateful that i can close the book and keep the selfcentered churls inside well , some of them at least
crotononhudson the hudson national golf club , which has been open for business on weekends only on its hilltop site here , has reached a turning point in its efforts to begin full operations that may be good news for those who view the new luxury course as a tax boon for the village , but environmentalists here are wary the village planning board will meet wednesday at 8 pm to consider hudson national s revised programs for waterquality monitoring and drainage control as well as other issues related to the company s deviation from construction plans originally approved for the 260acre site i think this will have a happy ending , said dr stuart z cohen , the waterqualitycontrol consultant to the planning board we see the light at the end of the tunnel while the planning board may be close to allowing the golf club to open full time , environmentalists are still not satisfied with the club s efforts to repair damage resulting from construction in two adjacent nature sanctuaries we 're not happy , and we 're a little frustrated now because they 've been allowed to open , said anne h swaim , the staff naturalist at the brinton brook audubon sanctuary , which occupies 128 acres directly north of the golf course ms swaim said the sediment from the course had been draining into a pond in the sanctuary , and that there had been a marked increase in algae growth in the brinton brook stream corridor as a result karen jescavagebernard , president of the croton arboretum and sanctuary , a preserve situated to the south of the golf course , said the 20acre nonprofit sanctuary , made up of half wetlands and half woods , had suffered repeated environmental impacts , mostly due to flooding and sedimentation she said it was especially important to safeguard the sanctuary s wetlands because the waters drain into the hudson river hudson national , which has been ordered to stop applying pesticides and fertilizers until waterquality issues are settled , ran into trouble with the village soon after construction started on the 30 million course in 1994 there were a great many infractions , both minor and large , said bruce m donohue , another consultant to the planning board mr donohue , owner of environmental design consulting in westport , said the club s main violation was the extreme clearing of trees and ground cover , which led to erosion and muddy runoffs after winter storms the muddy streams washed out driveways in surrounding neighborhoods in addition to depositing sediment in the sanctuaries marc c bergschneider , chairman of national fairways of greenwich , which owns hudson national , said the clearing was a mistake but called the construction changes an expected thing he said , it s a very complicated process with extraneous events you ca n't control he said the company would seek approval for the golf course in its present form at the meeting on wednesday neighbors describe the course as extremely beautiful and compare it with an african savanna , or treelees grassland the club sits atop a winding private road , which climbs to a crest overlooking the hudson river on one side and rolling hills on the other the initial membership fee in the club is 137 , 500 yearly dues are 8 , 000 mr bergschneider said the course , which was designed by the awardwinning golf architect tom fazio , would be restricted to 360 members so far , there are 200 members on a brilliantly sunny morning recently , staff members worked on the grounds , readying the temporary clubhouse for the fourth of july weekend kent a cayce , director of golf operations , said future plans included turning an old stone manor house on top of the hill into a permanent clubhouse and building 10 bungalows for overnight visitors on a promontory overlooking the hudson currently , logs , gravel and construction debris are piled on the promontory dr cohen said that despite earlier disagreements with hudson national , everyone wants a championquality golf course that will produce revenue for the town no one wants the golf course to die village officials , including those who expressed concern about the longterm effects of pesticides and fertilizers , said they were now optimistic about the safeguards things are coming to a successful and agreeable conclusion , said ann h gallelli , a village trustee who serves as a liaison to the planning board by and large , the golf course is a very popular thing it s going to produce about 400 , 000 in tax income for the school district and the village fran allen , a planning board member , said the efforts of dr cohen , who is president of environmental and turf services in wheaton , md , had been crucial in bringing the golf course and the village to an expected agreement speaking from maryland , dr cohen said hudson national had agreed to nearly all 20 of his recommendations regarding monitoring for pesticides and fertilizers in surface and ground water of special importance to the village , ms allen said , is hudson national s agreement to the stipulation that any significant residues found in the water from now on can be attributed to golf course activities , unless the club proves otherwise dr cohen said he also expected the golf club to agree to a revised drainage control plan before wednesday s meeting we 're going through it painstakingly hole by hole , he said ms swaim said brinton brook sanctuary was still waiting for the golf club to replant bordering trees and shrubs , which were lost in the clearing process ms jescavagebernard said board members of the croton arboretum would attend the planning board meeting wednesday and continue to press their demands we want the golf club to correctly complete remedial plantings , she

a lot of rain has fallen so far this year , meaning plant growth in many places has been rather astounding impatiens are gigantic lawns are lush and velvety green beans and onions are bulging there is something else as well mushrooms are popping up everywhere abundant moisture means funguses in the lawn around the compost pile , even in driveways woodland paths , especially those covered with wood chips , are alive with them so are flower borders and every so often some can be seen in sunny meadows the spores for these curious forms may lie dormant for many years until conditions are just right although certain species of mushrooms are known to appear throughout the year , the advent of high humidity this season has encouraged many more unlike most of the plants we generally deal with , funguses do not have chlorophyll that is , mushrooms do not have the usual green color that permits plants to manufacture the simple sugars used for nourishment because of this omission , mushrooms have to take their nourishment from the ground from compost , animal dung , rotting wood and leaves they push down filaments called mycelium to take up the nutrients they need sometimes , when rotting leaves are turned over , this white mycelium can be seen , making patterns on the dark background although many of the common plant diseases , including rose black spot and potato blight , are the result of funguses there are some big pluses to relate gourmets could certainly recite some and , thanks to molds , the world has been able to make use of penicillin one of the most curious phenomenons regarding mushrooms , especially in the spring , is a circular pattern of growth , resulting in a sort of fairy ring quite often this ring will show up in the lawn or in a particular section of a wooded area over the years , this ring may become larger as the mushroom myceliums span outward to absorb more nutrients quite often this fairy ring s appearance matches the size of an old tree stump , fallen log or old septic tank for most of my growingup years the curious funguses were referred to as toadstools it was not until college that the word mushroom took over , as a proper name one might be curious about the derivation of the earlier expression though beatrix potter and her wonderful children s books might be thought responsible , one can determine that toadstool may have come from the old english name for toad , which was tadde the funguses were known as todestoles and that may have been corrupted over years of use in the arco guide to collecting and studying mushrooms , toadstools and fungi the author alan major writes , the word may have simply originated from the rural belief that toads were venomous , that fungi developed from poisonous substances in the earth and that both occurred together in shady , damp and 'unwholesome' places' one thing was certain , however the word toadstool had a special meaning it was always used to denote caution and still is to all intents the name designates mushrooms that are known to be poisonous in recent times , the study of mushrooms has become a great hobby with many people small groups go on weekend hunts and utilize field guides to help them identify the species some funguses are beautiful to see a few are quite colorful many are rare and worth a special hunt one of the most popular field guides , well illustrated with good color plates is found in the peterson field guide series mushrooms by kent h and vera mcknight the guide includes 510 species found in the continental united states and canada the authors have even inserted a few recipes in the back for utilizing the tastiest morsels one recipe bears the title fillet of sole with shaggy manes but as is well known , many species of mushrooms are poisonous and none should be eaten unless they have been positively identified too many sad stories have been related about mushroom poisoning , often stemming from overconfidence on the part of amateur botanists who are sure they have identified a particular species one of the particular hazards is finding mushrooms in woodlands or ravines that look exactly like the ones we used to eat in the old country the consequences can be dire indeed only the experts know for sure the identity of edible species they can select the edible , safe species to enjoy the general rule for any mushroom exploration is look and admire , but do n't eat or , of course , homeowners and gardeners can rely on mushrooms sold at the produce stores , which are stocking more varieties these days these merchants buy their stock from commercial growers specializing in particularly appealing sorts of funguses drawing
hawarden , iowa , feb 1 the small group of voters gathered in the library of the local high school listened respectfully but seemingly without great enthusiasm as senator richard g lugar outlined his views on a tax overhaul , gun control , illegal immigration and abortion but when the subject changed to agriculture , things perked up jokes and barbs were exchanged as mr lugar and his audience discussed target prices for grain , pork exports to asia , corn futures and mr lugar s own 604acre farm in indiana it s not a hobby farm , mr lugar said with pride we make money every year we take it very seriously accounting for about 20 percent of iowa s employment , farmers and workers in farmrelated industries are a major force in the state s economy as well as in its politics and , as was evident in a recent campaign swing through des moines and northwest iowa , including this small town and sioux city , mr lugar is hoping to tap into the farm vote to help lift his flagging campaign for the republican presidential nomination while congress this week is debating a farm bill that would gradually eliminate many of the government s agriculture subsidy programs , few of the republican candidates , with the exception of mr lugar and senator bob dole of kansas , have had much to say about farm issues when asked why agriculture issues have taken a back seat in this year s campaign , mr lugar said in an interview none of the other candidates even have a slight familiarity with the issues agriculture issues are very complex , and farmers here are very sophisticated people they understand better than most all the complexities i supposed the other candidates would be reduced to saying , let the free market work or i'm against controls or some other bromide of that variety mr lugar is chairman of the senate agriculture committee , and his role in setting farm policy will be on display this week as he pushes the farm bill , which is scheduled for a senate vote this week the bill would end most farm subsidies over seven years , would allow farmers to plant more acres and would give them more of a choice of what they can plant it is very popular among most farm groups in iowa but as has been the case for much of the senator s campaign , whatever his views and accomplishments might be on agriculture , mr lugar s message is being drowned out in a sea of television commercials promoting other candidates , most notably steve forbes and his plan for a flat tax i still have that fundamental problem , mr lugar said they need to know that we 're there even on tax issues , mr lugar s message is not reaching much of an audience he has proposed a plan that is much more radical than mr forbes s flat tax replacing the current income tax system with a national sales tax but given mr forbes s lavish advertising campaign , mr lugar s idea has not been part of the debate for 10 million to 20 million , i could popularize my idea , too , mr lugar said on tuesday at the iowa pork producers convention in des moines the reason the flat tax is generally more popular is that it s been marketed with extraordinary multiples of any other policy that i have seen in the campaign photo senator richard g lugar , campaigning this week in iowa , ishoping to tap into the farm vote to energize his flagging presidential campaign mr lugar , who owns a farm , heads the senate agriculture committee \( associated press \)

madrid , march 5 jose maria aznar may sound dull and nasal to many spaniards , but in a crisis he knows how to keep his head last april , 40 pounds of explosives intended for the conservative leader blew up just yards short of his bulletproof car mr aznar climbed from the wreck largely unscathed , brushed off his clothes and walked to a nearby hospital on sunday he was tested again when he lived up to his pledge to run spain s longtime prime minister , felipe gonzalez , out of office but when the final results were in , instead of celebrating a sweeping victory , mr aznar , a former tax inspector from madrid , found himself caught in a labyrinth the narrow conservative victory has disappointed many aznar supporters and elated the socialists , who had feared a more humiliating defeat in the end , mr aznar got 388 percent of the vote , only 14 percent more than mr gonzalez , a difference of 340 , 000 of the more than 25 million votes cast on television and in news conferences , mr gonzalez has been beaming like the winner , and mr aznar has looked despondent never has a defeat been so sweet , and never has a victory been so bitter , a smiling mr gonzalez said today twenty seats short of a parliamentary majority , mr aznar , leader of the popular party , will have to stoop and make deals with heads of other , smaller parties none are people whom mr aznar is known to admire some he has scorned openly typically , mr aznar has seemed unperturbed announcing that he had won , he said that the country has begun a new chapter in its history spain s political shift to the right is indeed a major turnabout after 13 years under socialist rule but asked how mr aznar was feeling , one of his aides said he is fine he s in a fine mess in private , his aides concede that spain s new era may bring much bickering and possible instability when cartoonists have portrayed spain s two principal politicians , they have drawn the socialist mr gonzalez , a somewhat pudgy but seductive orator from seville , as a snake charmer mr aznar , a slightly built castilian and an awkward speaker , has been depicted as a marionette yet what binds these two very different men now is their dependence on the same wellknown spanish political figure , a catalan for the past 30 months , while mr gonzalez was leading a minority government , he was beholden to jordi pujol , president of the catalan regional government , whose party had the votes he needed in parliament now it is mr aznar s turn to depend on the catalan s 16 seats to form a government even then he may have to turn to the canary islands or another small regional group mr pujol , a former banker , is said to savor the role of kingmaker but so far his answer to mr aznar has been no in the way stands what friends call the forthright manner of mr aznar and critics describe as his lack of political savvy for the past 30 months he has been unrelenting in his criticism of mr pujol s support of the gonzalez government he has been attacking us for the past three years , said pere esteve , a catalan political leader this cannot be fixed in two days the only thing that has changed since march 3 is that they have stopped insulting us begging for support and having to make concessions is hard for a man as proud as mr aznar , according to his friends he takes pride in his own tenacious efforts to bring young people into the party and pull it away from the far right his friends have often heard him say that he has never asked anyone for favors , so he is not indebted to anyone miguel angel rodriguez , his press chief , said that his independence helped him survive when mr aznar took over the rightwing popular alliance in 1989 and renamed it the popular party , he got a telephone call from a senior member of the roman catholic church hierarchy , asking him , as a catholic politician , to issue a public statement against abortion his reply was , 'i shall , if you will seek votes for the popular party in the sunday mass , ' mr rodriguez said even on the eve of the elections , mr aznar was reported to have not made any cabinet preparations he has never promised anyone anything , said one of his collaborators , except his wife when he married her mr aznar spends his spare time largely with his wife , ana botella , a lawyer like him , and their three children he also plays a weekly game of paddle tennis with his friend pedro ramirez , the editor of the conservative daily newspaper el mundo , which has dug up most of the corruption and political scandals involving the gonzalez administration one question often asked here is why the solemn and stiff mr aznar has a large following among women he is not the classic spanish macho and he has a lot of integrity , said cristina loring , member of a prominent madrid publishing family amalia gomez , a member of parliament from mr aznar s party , said as a woman , i feel very good in this party he has promoted many women he believes in equality mr aznar , 43 , was born in madrid and comes from a family of conservative political journalists a grandfather of mr aznar was an important chronicler of franco s side in the civil war and both his grandfather and his father held government jobs during the franco dictatorship this family history may be one reason why mr aznar insists so often that his conservatism is modern , close to the center , with no links to the dark demons of spain s fascist past on the eve of the elections , mr aznar was asked on nationwide television if it was true that there was a whole jurassic park of old , hardline rightists hiding behind him , waiting to jump out after the elections mr aznar , not finding this funny , replied solemnly , in spain the far right no longer exists photo his reputation for being uncompromising helped jose maria aznar , the popular party , to oust prime minister felipe gonzalez , but the same trait is a disadvantage as the conservative leader seeks coalition partners \( agence francepresse \)
washington , april 21 the political action committee once headed by speaker newt gingrich , gopac , worked on behalf of republican state and local candidates without submitting required reports in some states the political action committee , which concentrated on assisting lowerlevel republican candidates , acknowledges that it was active in aiding state and local republican campaigns in 1990 mr gingrich stepped down as its leader in may 1994 but the associated press checked 18 states where gopac said it had spent money in that year and found no reports on file with state elections officials in four of them colorado , new york , texas and wisconsin incomplete reports were available in five others georgia , california , michigan , missouri and mississippi gopac s executive director , lisa b nelson , said the group had filed proper reports wherever they were required , but she could not explain why some states had no such records , which they are required by law to keep it could be that the files of some of these states are as incomplete as some of our records are , ms nelson said in late 1990 , gopac sent its members a mailing detailing its 1990 election activities on behalf of lowerlevel candidates in colorado , gopac contributed 9 , 700 to seven statelevel political candidates , it said colorado election officials have no record of those donations , despite rules that all contributions exceeding 25 must be reported new york officials have no record of two 2 , 500 contributions gopac gave republican campaign committees in that state , even though laws require that pac donations of 1 , 000 or more be reported records in mr gingrich s home state of georgia show that gopac reported spending 6 , 000 there in 1990 , none of it for individual candidates but gopac s own report for 1990 said nine georgia candidates had split a total of 10 , 000 in campaign contributions in that year gopac also filed no disclosure forms in texas , despite a state law that requires reports from any pac that makes more than 20 percent of its total contributions there or gets donations of more than 100 gopac s records show that 42 percent of its 1990 contributions went to texas and that numerous donors gave 100 or more common cause , the political watchdog group , plans to ask the house special counsel , james m cole , to investigate whether gopac fulfilled state reporting requirements , said the group s president , ann mcbride gopac had previously attracted questions about its work on behalf of candidates for federal office but a federal judge dismissed in february a government lawsuit accusing gopac of illegally aiding federal candidates in 1990

it started when some residents of fifth avenue looked out their windows one day and saw a blue and orange jungle gym in the park across the street central park , that is no sooner was that problem resolved than park enthusiasts were horrified by another proposal to install several information kiosks in the park , each with maps , directions and a donor s name that did it now it is allout war between the central park conservancy and a small but vocal band of opponents there have been gatherings in fifth avenue apartments and fliers appearing in lobbies people are talking in exclamation points and trading faxes an emergency meeting is set for next wednesday to mobilize for a showdown at city hall there are going to be movie stars and god knows what , said richard l feigen , the new york art dealer , who lives on fifth avenue we are talking about major people here he argues that the conservancy , a philanthropic group that manages the park with the city , acts too independently it has such power it has become effectively a city agency why do they have such power \? to which karen putnam , head of the conservancy , sighs a sad sigh , since the group is subject to what is probably the most exhaustive review process imaginable for everything it does in the city s most pampered park i guess it is ironic , she said yesterday it is also inaccurate the parks commissioner , henry j stern , is less polite there s wild hysteria about this and it is based on a distortion , he complained i think the conservancy has picked up a couple of enemies among the richies that surround the park , and they are stirring things up we even got letters from barbara walters and mary tyler moore not that the proposal for these new kiosks has been a secret the conservancy first proposed putting better directions in the park four years ago central park is a big place and sometimes people get lost , what with frederick law olmsted s graceful , curvilinear paths that go there when they seem to go here so , said the city and the conservancy , let us give the people help maps and directions on attractive kiosks the idea subsequently won advisory approval from five community boards and the landmarks preservation commission the plan was scaled back to take objections and recommendations into account now , instead of more than 41 kiosks , there will be 23 , and they will all be inside the park in strategic locations none on the perimeter the threesided kiosks of black painted steel on a granite base will stand 6 feet 8 inches tall and about three feet wide the information kiosks , the first 12 of which are being underwritten by a grant of 200 , 000 over four years from the new york times company foundation , will each include a credit to the donor the lettering will be a maximum of two inches high the credit was the conservancy s idea because all such gifts are similarly acknowledged , ms putnam said neither the foundation nor any prospective contributor asked to be credited , she emphasized critics , including landmarks west , the municipal art society and the sierra club , anticipate graffiti and object to the size of the kiosks , but it is the credit line that most infuriates them now it s the times , but i said to henry , 'what if mcdonald s or burger king is next , on every single one of these things \? ' mr feigen said once advertising starts , you cannot put parameters on this brendan sexton , president of the municipal art society , agreed we see this as crossing the line , he said it is using the park for promotion he called the conservancy effective , but a victim of its own independence some habits of a democracy that a public official might acquire , the conservancy has not had to acquire for that accusation william lukashok , of community board 5 , has one word bogus he is head of his board s parks committee , and he said , we were given ample opportunity for review that s how it works the plan for the jungle gym went through the entire review process , too , raising hackles only after it appeared in the playground at 76th street and fifth avenue , its howard johnson colors marring some views of the park the group quickly collected 10 , 800 for a dark green replacement changing the kiosk designs will be more difficult , since the plan is going to the city art commission for final consideration on dec 9 it will be a stormy meeting down there , mr feigen predicted i promise
it is n't every day that a firstclass sqan lake floats into town but sonia arova and thor sutowski offered nothing less in their striking staging for ballet south on sunday afternoon true to form , the brooklyn center for the performing arts , with its consistently adventuresome programming , introduced still another unknown company to new york city at brooklyn college the beauty of this production lies in its essence , the ability to capture the spirit of a 19thcentury classic that too often is betrayed or corrupted by wrongheaded tinkering much of ms arova s and mr sutowski s fouract version is rechoreographed , but they have met the highest standards they have topped their cast with gifted russiantrained recruits and done wonders with a corps that they have trained remarkably at the alabama school of fine arts in birmingham ms arova , nonetheless , is not your ordinary fine teacher bulgarianborn , she studied in paris with olga preobrajenska , who knew how to pass down a capsulized version of her own training at the russian imperial ballet ms arova belongs to the grand generation of postwar international ballerinas she danced mainly in companies in europe but local audiences saw her with american ballet theater in the 1950 s and as rudolf nureyev s partner 'n his new york debut in 1962 ms arova went on to become artistic director of the norwegian ballet before she and mr sutowski , a dancer and choreographer , settled in birmingham in 1976 a husband and wife team , they have trained excellent dancers at the staterun school of fine arts , including wes chapman and kathleen moore , now at american ballet theater obviously , they have been equally successful with ballet south an outgrowth of a civic troupe , the company turned professional in 1981 under its original name , the state of alabama ballet no one could mistake it for a major company but this swan lake has taste and style the choreographic changes , linked to several musical interpolations , are never jarring ms arova , the company s artistic director , and mr sutowski , associate artistic director , have drawn from a variety of other productions but maintain their own originality in acts i and iii , patrick badua is repeatedly given bravura solos to show off his magnificent springy jump and strong technique although listed as benno , prince siegfried s friend , his role harks back to the jester and tutor of other productions the pas d' trois in act i here begins with music that tchaikovsky wrote originally for act iii anne mueller , cari roussanoff and edgar badua danced the new choreography in unison in the adagio , and ms roussanoff had a difficult solo from the same score the solos for mr badua and ms mueller and the coda were performed to the music balanchine used in tchaikovsky pas de deux the dancing had the verve of the waltz in the same act here the choreographers were effective in their interplay among a corps , three couples and the prince as siegfried , edouard smirnov , formerly with the bolshoi ballet , was impressive in his noble line , confident partnering and strong sovietstyle pirouettes f he needs more projection , his elegance was always visib'e whether he was partnering tatiana ledovkikh , also once with the bolshoi , as odette , or her evil counterpart , odile , portrayed by olga toziakova , originally from the perm ballet in russia usually , the same ballerina dances both roles but double casting , as in this case , is not new , and the contrast between the two dancers was shrewdly dramatic miss ledovkikh s swan queen is blond , tall , slim , beautifully stretched in her dancing her odette in act ii is cool rather than deep but firmly etched upon the eye the more technically demanding role of odile showed ms toziakova as more of a rough diamond yet her dynamic forcefulness is apt and her fouettes at the end polished the national dancep in act iii have been turned into neitherfishnorfowl numbers the women often wear heels and do character steps while the men wear ballet slippers and do classical steps this composite approach works somet'mes sometimes it does not what is always effective is the corps work , as young women of all shapes and sizes show off a brilliant clarity and detail in their footwork , stand centered on toe and dance with a pure classical style no wonder t'e production \( with sets borrowed from ballet west and attractive costumes by igor roussanoff \) has a happy ending there is none of the usual suicide business rothbart , the evil magician \( christopher demellier \) , is defeated , and the apotheosis 'usic reconciles odette and siegfried in the here and now photo tatiana ledovkikh and edouard smirnov , center , and members ofthe ballet south troupe in swan lake \( nan melville for the new york times \)
school officials are still slogging through the thick book of curriculum standards that the new jersey department of education released last month but at least one recommendation to teach foreign languages to every child starting in kindergarten has already created a ruckus the proposal fits into a new set of curriculum standards that the state department of education is hoping to adopt this spring new jersey is under a state supreme court order to equalize spending in its 600 school districts by september , and the standards are part of the state s strategy leo f klagholz , the commissioner of education , plans to use the standards to determine exactly how much education should cost each district besides foreign languages , the standards cover the arts , health and physical education , literacy , mathematics , science and social studies but the language category has stirred the most controversy , mostly because educators around the state are worried that they will never have enough money to provide language instruction in every classroom although most high schools and many middle schools in new jersey teach foreign languages , only a handful of elementary schools do so there is no question that every student would benefit from learning a foreign language , said david nash , a spokesman for the new jersey principals and supervisors association in trenton but if we are really serious about this , there are implications for the length of the school day and especially for staffing none of the 56 curriculum standards specify how schools must teach various subjects , but they broadly outline what students are expected to know to pass standardized tests in the fourth , eighth and twelfth grades for example , fourth graders should be able to express emotions and describe people using short phrases and sentences in a foreign language , while eighth graders should be able to give directions and describe places in detail by high school graduation , students will be expected to converse with increasing linguistic accuracy , among other things some education department officials say the standards will not require every elementary school to hire new language teachers , because they will be able to use technology and provide existing teachers with basic training but lynn maher , a spokeswoman for the new jersey education association , the largest teachers' union , says new teachers will be essential if the program is to succeed there s no research that says you can learn a language with cdrom , and inservice training is an inappropriate way of teaching a language , she said teachers who are certified in a certain language are the ones who should be teaching that language in an interview last week , mr klagholz said the language standards might be refined or even overhauled before the state board of education votes on them in may but he stressed that before education officials fret over the details , they must decide whether foreign languages really belong in the state s core curriculum the right sequence is deciding first whether this is an essential part of a kid s education , he said then we can get to the practical issues , including how to reorganize to include world languages in every grade \( after that , there is the problem of making sure wealthy districts do not offer many more language classes than poor ones , in keeping with the court order to equalize spending we do n't want some districts to have eight languages and others to have just one , mr klagholz said \) like a number of states , new jersey has seized on foreign language instruction as a way to increase children s understanding of other cultures and their chances of finding a job in an increasingly global economy but other states that have introduced foreign language standards have struggled to find enough teachers for every elementary school north carolina , which has required language instruction starting in kindergarten since 1987 , has started intensive teachertraining programs and recruited a number of foreignlanguage teachers from abroad , said fran hoch , who oversees language programs in the north carolina department of education the need for spanish teachers is especially acute , she said , since that language is by far the most popular north carolina has struggled to keep its foreign language program afloat , ms hoch said , because the state has not been able to provide sufficient funds at its peak , 60 percent of public school students were studying a foreign language , she said , but the number has dropped to 50 percent and probably will not increase standards mean the schools will do a much better job because they 're being held accountable , said david edwards , executive director of the joint national committee for languages , a lobbying group in washington but because of money problems and teacher shortages , the standards are not always enforced in new jersey , a few districts offer language instruction at the elementary level , but classes are generally offered once a week mr edwards says he doubts that elementary schools will be able to offer anything more substantial in the next few years if you had asked me two years ago , i would have said the chances were great , he said but all of a sudden , the political pendulum has swung back to tax cuts and deficit reductions , and

norwich , conn , aug 21 david cone s thoughts were on much more than balls and strikes tonight in this picturesque little ball park in the heart of eastern connecticut and why not \? three and a half months ago , cone had no idea what was wrong with his pitching hand then came visit after visit to doctors and batteries of tests through it all , the numbness would not go away then came the speculation that cone might have risked serious injury by pitching may 2 , just eight days before he would undergo veingraft surgery to remove the aneurysm that was finally discovered beneath his right armpit i 've thought back to the time when i first heard the word aneurysm , cone said hours before he was to make his first rehabilitation start for the yankees' class aa affiliate , the norwich navigators , in what has turned into a remarkable comeback story i was wondering if i 'd ever throw a ball again i remember laying on the examining table , with a catheter stuck in my groin injecting dye into my body , and hearing that word aneurysm , wondering , 'what the heck does this mean \? and will i ever throw a baseball again \? ' once i found out the nature of the injury and educated myself , i knew that this day would come it was just a matter of when that time came today at 7 16 pm in thomas j dodd memorial stadium when the yankee righthander took the mound in a game for the first time since his surgery on may 10 the aneurysm seemed like ancient history tonight cone threw 54 pitches in four innings and walked off the mound to a standing ovation from the 7 , 056 fans in this 6 , 000seat stadium the biggest crowd this park has seen i was thinking this is the way it is supposed to be , cone said when asked what was going through his mind as he walked back to the dugout after he had registered the last of seven strikeouts in his appearance against the binghamton mets , which lasted less than an hour tonight was huge for me i'm very pleased i mixed in everything i had cone had admitted before the game that he was nervous this is a big day for me , he said it was for everybody even without cone , it s a big game for us , said navigators manager jim essian , whose club lost last night s game , 52 , and lost ground on the mets in the chase for the eastern league northern division s final playoff spot having david cone out there just adds to it which would explain the overflow crowd , the buzzing in the stands hours before game time and the news media jammed into makeshift working quarters everyone is very happy just to see him pitch , said neil blinderman , a season ticketholder here at the center of it all , of course , was cone , the 33yearold righthander whose performance was being watched by the yankee physician stuart hershon and the assistant general manager brian cashman cone arrived at 4 20 pm soon , his wife , lynn , and 25 family friends would be at the park , too it all contributed to a carnival atmosphere , all part of the circus of being a professional star there were the requisite coneheads in the stands even phil geisler , binghamton s starting left fielder , added to the scene by whirling around in front of the mets' dugout with a cone on his head while cone was taking his warmup tosses maybe i should have noticed , cone said with a laugh after geisler proceeded to hit two doubles off him cone s awkward nervousness was at a crescendo right before his first pitch it was difficult to tell , though cone was sharp tonight about the only thing cone was missing was three or four miles an hour on a fastball that topped out at 90 mph the first pitch he threw was a fastball that binghamton right fielder scott pagano popped to center it took cone just six pitches to drop down and fire a slider past shortstop kevin morgan for the first of his strikeouts two pitches later , cone surrendered a homer off a fastball to first baseman brian daubach that sailed over the 16foot fence in right field that , the two doubles cone allowed to geisler and an errant pickoff throw that led to binghamton s second run were about the only mistakes cone made at times , my fastball was flat , cone said when it was , it got hammered aside from that , cone had great control , his slider popped and he used his splitfinger fastball as an out pitch against lefthanders he struck out the side in the fourth in all , cone faced 16 batters , retired the side in order in the third and faced a threeball count only once the last two innings , i was right where i wanted to be , cone said the first two , i was a little rough around the edges but it was a good way to finish his next outing will be monday , when he will be held to 75 pitches he may be allowed to throw as many as 90 pitches in his final class aa start the yankees' latest revised timetable calls for cone to then face the toronto blue jays at yankee stadium on sept 6 that is the plan as cone said today , the yankees always seem to change their minds but whenever he arrives back at the stadium , it will be none too soon for his employers or for cone and when cone finally dons pinstripes again , it will cap one of the more improbable stories of 1996 this injury was at one time thought to be potentially lifethreatening , remember \? tonight was the first step back , a more relaxed cone said afterward i pitched again this year i got to do what i love again and it felt great inside pitch katsuhiro maeda , the ballyhooed , hardthrowing , 24yearold righthander with the fuchsiadyed hair is 21 for norwich with a 362 earned run average this season after being signed from japan though he has just 20 strikeouts in 37 2 3 innings pitched , maeda s fastball has been clocked at 93 mph and he is not short on confidence when asked when he expected to make the majors , maeda said , through an interpreter , i'm ready , but they have n't called me photos david cone pitching last night for the norwich navigators the yankee pitcher is working his way back from the surgery he had on may 10 \( associated press \) \( pg b15 \) david cone , making his first rehab start since surgery , watching a home run leaving the ball park last night \( george ruhe for the new york times \) \( pg b17 \)
indianapolis , may 23 the five drivers seated on the podium at the indianapolis motor speedway spanned the spectrum of motor racing and , at the same time , symbolized what the 1996 indianapolis 500 is about rookies , of all sorts and of all levels of experience at one end was joe gosek , a 40yearold ovaltrack racer from oswego , ny , who could turn and shake hands with 39yearold michele alboreto , a veteran of the glamorous international formula one circuit at the other end were fermin velez , a spaniard who was racing a ferrari in upstate connecticut last memorial day weekend , and michel jourdain jr , a mexican who has n't reached his 20th birthday and in the middle \? none other than slick racin gardner \( and there s not a single nickname in there \) , a 24yearold las vegas , nev , racer who has driven over 500 miles an hour , more than twice as fast as the quickest lap turned here at the indianapolis motor speedway but that was in a straight line out here , gardner said today , it seems like you 're going a little bit faster that s because , as gardner noted , he has to keep turning left if that were the only instruction gardner and the 16 other firsttime indy drivers in the 33driver lineup needed to remember for sunday s race , everyone would be feeling a lot better about the prospects of a safe event concern about safety has become more heightened here in the last week scott brayton , the most experienced driver entered in the race , was killed last friday when a tire deflated and his car crashed \( the marion county coroner s office announced today that brayton died of a basal skull fracture \) two rookies were hurt in other crashes at a meeting this morning , race officials gave the freshmen their orientation they told us that the track is going to look different with all the crowds in it on sunday , velez said , that it s going to look narrow the united states auto club officials , led by the chief steward keith ward , also warned them about the extreme air turbulence generated by the 33 cars as they head toward the first turn in a tight pack \( the big mess in the air , as velez put it \) i 've been told it s like a completely different experience , said richie hearn , 25 , a rookie from canyon country , calif , who will start 15th it s like you have n't been here all month the rookies heard lectures they also saw videotapes of the last six indy 500 starts , most of which were very ragged , especially the one last year , which many people believe led to the firstturn crash that almost killed stan fox the message would have sounded familiar even to drivereducation students do n't tailgate although to hear hearn describe it , the lesson might not have sunk in that was the biggest thing at the meeting just keeping your distance from the row in front of you , hearn said one hundred feet , or 100 yards , or something i do n't remember four rookies in particular gosek , gardner , scott harrington and brad murphey will be driving in their first major indycar race sunday driver inexperience and the relatively advanced age of some of the cars are the biggest concerns for sunday s race and soon after the final practice session began today , those worries looked to be wellgrounded in 23 minutes of greenflag time , there were two oil leaks , an engine failure , a minor pit fire and a crash paul durant s car , the oldest one in the race , stopped out on the track with the engine problem two minutes later , buzz calkins of denver , the rookie who won the inaugural indy racing league event jan 27 at walt disney world , hastily exited his car in the pits after it caught fire while his crew members were trying to fill up his fuel tank they poured buckets of water on the car s engine cover to douse the fire , and nobody was injured but it cannot be a promising omen when a fire starts while a team is refueling under much more leisurely conditions than they will face during the race youthful enthusiasm being what it is , though , optimism appears to have barely dimmed calkins , 25 , remarked that the rookies have n't wreaked the havoc everyone thought they would to be true , there have been a few incidents , he said , but nothing out of the ordinary  2 drivers barred from practice concord , nc , may 23 \( ap \) jeff gordon and dale earnhardt were among 16 drivers held out of cocacola 600 practice today after nascar inspectors found inferior tubing in their cars' roll cages the same discovery prompted nascar officials to temporarily bar another eight busch grand national drivers from practicing for saturday s red dog 300 , also at charlotte motor speedway the diameter of the tubing in question was within twohundredths of an inch of meeting the sanctioning body s requirements safety concern is the issue here , the nascar spokesman kevin triplett said , adding that no fines were imposed on any of the teams because it appeared the tubing may have come from the same supplier and that the supplier may not have known it did not meet specifications photos a day at the track at indy arie luyendyk , at left , walkingthrough the pit area yesterday , and danny ongais , right , in the car of the late scott brayton \( associated press \)
washington , june 13 invoking its precedents against the use of race in legislative districting , the supreme court today invalidated one congressional district in north carolina and three in texas as the product of unconstitutional racial gerrymanders all four districts had been drawn after the 1990 census to give minority voters more electoral influence the twin 5to4 rulings took a big , although still inconclusive , step toward answering the question raised by two earlier rulings whether any districts drawn with race in mind will overcome the presumption that using race , at least as a predominant factor , is unconstitutional the rulings , in 1993 and last year , made majorityblack districts open to legal challenge by disaffected white voters and subject to searching scrutiny under the 14th amendment s guarantee of equal protection lawyers representing black voters said today that more and more , it appeared that no districts would pass muster the noose is tightening , elaine jones , directorcounsel of the naacp legal defense and educational fund , inc , said in an interview laughlin mcdonald , director of the southern regional office of the american civil liberties union , predicted the result would be the bleaching of congress as well as state and local legislative bodies , as new districts drawn across the south to increase minority representation fall under legal attack the approach the court took in the decisions today appears to commit it to an intensive , casebycase review of these districts the decisions encompassed 189 pages and , in the texas case , included a detailed analysis of the three challenged districts , in a plurality opinion by justice sandra day o'connor rejecting pleas from the four dissenters to reverse course and back away from applying the strictest constitutional scrutiny to majorityblack districts , justice o'connor said we see no need to revisit our prior debates the court s precedents acknowledge voters as more than mere racial statistics , she said the rulings produced widespread confusion in both north carolina and texas , where the incumbents from the four affected districts are all seeking reelection and where primaries have already taken place and filing deadlines are passed now that the districts have been declared unconstitutional , the special threejudge federal district courts that presided over the litigation in each state will have to decide whether to permit the november elections to proceed under the existing lines , whether to draw new lines themselves , or whether the state legislatures must be summoned back into session it s unclear where we are headed now , said rep eddie bernice johnson , the incumbent in one of the majoritydistricts in texas , the 30th congressional district , which is in the dallas area the other affected districts are the 29th in texas , a majorityhispanic district in houston that is represented by a nonhispanic democrat , gene green the 18th in houston , a majority black district represented by sheila jackson lee and the 12th in north carolina , a majorityblack district that follows a narrow 160mile course along interstate 85 , represented by mel watt the second majorityblack district in north carolina , the 1st , was also challenged , but the court dismissed that challenge because none of the white plaintiffs actually lived in the district the court spoke with a splintered rather than clear voice today there was no majority opinion in the texas case , bush v vera , no 94805 , which served as the lead case of the pair justice sandra day o'connor wrote a plurality opinion for herself , chief justice william h rehnquist , and justice anthony m kennedy justices clarence thomas and antonin scalia , who agreed that the texas districts were unconstitutional , refused to sign justice o'connor s opinion because it held open at least the theoretical possibility that a district could take race into account and still be constitutional all racial classifications by government must be strictly scrutinized and , even in the sensitive area of state legislative redistricting , i would make no exceptions , justice thomas said in a concurring opinion that justice scalia also signed both justices john paul stevens and david h souter wrote dissenting opinions , each of which was also signed by justices ruth bader ginsburg and stephen g breyer the north carolina decision , shaw v hunt , no 94923 , was less equivocal , with chief justice rehnquist writing a relatively brief 19page opinion that was joined , without separate concurrences , by the other four who made up the majority in the texas case the difference was due in part to the fact that the court had no need for a close review of the facts in the north carolina case , which had been before the justices under the name of shaw v reno in 1993 the 1993 decision held for the first time that a district drawn to provide a black majority , and challenged by white voters , was subject to the strictest scrutiny under the 14th amendment s equal protection guarantee that is , that it could be justified only by a compelling state interest and had to be narrowly tailored to serve that interest in the 1993 ruling , the court had sent the north carolina districts back to the district court in raleigh to see if they could be justified under that standard
kabul , afghanistan , dec 18 when it came time for ghulam mohammed to die today , he raised his eyes toward the deep blue afghan sky then he stretched his bound hands out before him , palms upward , and gestured swiftly up and down , as though toward heaven amid the murmuring of the crowd , it was impossible to hear the words that came tumbling from mr mohammed , who was about to become the first person to be executed publicly in kabul since the taliban religious movement captured the afghan capital 12 weeks ago he might have been praying or he might have been making a last desperate plea for mercy from the man advancing toward him with a raised kalashnikov rifle under the sharia , the islamic code of justice imposed by the taliban in the threequarters of afghanistan under their control , mr mohammed was entitled to entreat his executioner for a reprieve and the executioner , whose pregnant wife and three small children mr mohammed was convicted of killing last year , was entitled to forgive the condemned man in that case , mr mohammed would have walked a free man from the kabul soccerfield that had been declared his place of execution on this chilly winter day but the bereaved man , mohammed alif , had waited for this moment ever since the evening last december when he arrived home to find his entire family slain so he walked the last few paces briskly , dropped to one knee , leveled the automatic rifle at mr mohammed standing 30 paces away , and fired as the twosecond burst stuttered across the field , the crowd of 3 , 000 men , almost all hardened taliban fighters , broke out with something like a stifled cheer , a dull ha , ha , ha that seemed like a counterpoint to the bullets that struck mr mohammed mr mohammed fell backwards , arms akimbo , and lay quite still , filigreed cotton skullcap still in place but a taliban cleric walked forward , glanced down at the fallen man , and beckoned mr alif forward to insure that mr mohammed could not have survived , mr alif stood at his victim s flank , pointed the rifle at his chest , and fired another twosecond burst through mr mohammed s traditional kneelength shirt the body twitched , the crowd offered another stifled cheer , and a doctor examined the fallen man to verify that the execution was complete for the taliban , the grim tableau seemed both a celebration of their unbridled power and the triumph of their form of islamic radicalism by chance or not , the point on the soccer field where mr mohammed died , is about 150 paces from the concrete traffic post where , at first light 83 days before , the taliban began their conquest of kabul by castrating , shooting and finally hanging the last communist president of afghanistan , najibullah if that event shocked a world inured to the violence that has blighted afghanistan for a generation , it set the tone for what followed taliban leaders , mostly village men indifferent or hostile to the yearning among many people in kabul for a more tolerant life , set about imposing a rigid social code that forbade women to work , closed all schools for girls , and issued a host of other edicts that made kabul a sprawling urban version of an afghan village , where attitudes towards women and pleasure have altered little since the days of medieval kings the hope of many in kabul , and of the small community of foreign aid workers who have tried to alleviate the hunger and hopelessness that endless cycles of war have brought to many in this city of more than a million people , was that taking power in the capital would somehow temper the taliban it was a hope that found an echo as far away as washington , where clinton administration officials , after suspending diplomatic contacts with the taliban in protest against the movement s harsh start in kabul , began saying by midnovember that the world should engage with the taliban if it wished to moderate their policies some in kabul still cling to similar hopes , but they are fewer by the week as the taliban entrench their control a military counteroffensive by two allied armies of more moderate muslims has stalled north of kabul , and been driven back beyond artillery range taliban pledges in october to review the ban on women working have come to nothing , and the ban has even been reinforced in recent days by a decree warning our afghan sisters against any attempt to seek work with foreign aid organizations , a favored employer among the 150 , 000 women who worked in the capital until the taliban takeover otherwise , if they are chased , threatened and investigated by us , the responsibility will be on them , the decree declared , according to an english translation that was delivered on monday to offices of the united nations , the red cross and a score of private aid organizations that have offices here last week , the same organization boasted over radio shariat , the taliban station , that taliban men had beaten 250 women on kabul streets in a single day for breaking the dress code , which requires the wearing of a headtotoe shroud with a lace grille over the eyes that is known here as a burqa
london , feb 9 it was about 6 55 pm when the security guards at the beaufort court , one of the sea of buildings in the canary wharf complex here , were told there had been a bomb threat and were ordered to evacuate offices but it was too late kevin grant , one of the guards , was starting to direct the evacuation when the explosion , which ripped through an underground parking lot about 200 yards from the building , picked him up and hurled him against a wall i was chucked across the room , he said , standing near the scene of the explosion several hours later , shivering from the cold and still in mild shock the whole building shook on the ground floor alan esherwood , another guard , was standing near the glassdoored entrance when it shattered there was a loud bang and a gush of wind , and suddenly the windows and doors and everything came through , he said i just pulled my coat over my head mr grant said none of the several dozen people still at work in the building appeared seriously injured by the explosion most casualties were caused by exploding glass falling onto passersby below workers throughout the docklands , whose sleek glass office buildings have become a symbol of thatcherera efforts to renew britain , were shocked by the explosion , which came as the work week was ending the whole building shook as if a huge gust of wind were whipping it around , said kareem fahmi , an account executive at the advertising agency ogilvy mather who was working at his computer i thought it must be a hurricane mr fahmi and his colleagues made it to safety , but found that others had not been so lucky glass blanketed the street , and in one building every window seemed to have been blown out i saw one person outside , completely covered in glass , he said interviewed by a local television station in the emergency room at the royal london hospital , neil parker , 16 , said he and his pregnant girlfriend had been thrown to the ground by the blast his arms and hands were covered with blood , and he said of the victims he had seen , there was blood all down them and their clothes were wrecked as he waited for treatment , other victims , bleeding , bandaged and dazed , were carried past on stretchers or pushed through in wheelchairs several hours after the blast , the area was teeming with rescue workers , doctors , ambulance drivers and police officers the smell of smoke stung the air canary wharf itself had been barricaded , and several train stations were closed some office workers , dependent on public transportation , were beginning long trudges home some residents of the nearby neighborhood said that even after years of bomb attacks in london , they were unprepared for this one because of the ceasefire announced 17 months ago by the irish republican army we thought it was an unexploded bomb from the war , said one resident , who identified herself only as christine at the tradewinds bar and restaurant , the owner , linda holmes , was serving drinks when the bomb went off we were still pulling pints when the bomb exploded , she said the windows were blown in , the radiator fell off the wall , and the ceiling came down ms holmes said that she did n't understand why , if the police had advance warning , she had not been told of the bomb threat what we want to know , she said , is why we were n't evacuated
despite piling one gain upon another in 1995 , managers of mutual funds that invest primarily in american stocks did something in the first quarter of this year that they were unable to do most of last year outperform the market average mutual funds that specialize in domestic equities rose 56 percent on average in the first quarter , according to morningstar , the chicago fund trackers that beat the 53 percent total return , including reinvested dividends , of the standard poor s 500 index , the benchmark for most equity fund managers , and marked the fifth consecutive quarter of gains international funds , helped by a resurgence in emerging markets , gained the same as their domestic counterparts but shareholders of bond funds , whose returns last year rivaled those of stock funds , suffered one of the worst markets in two years the average taxable bond fund fell 058 percent in the first quarter , while municipal bond funds lost an average of 156 percent even the winning equity performances mask a growing divergence among fund returns , differences that , if they continue to grow , could mean an increasingly rough ride for investors consider that the equity fund numbers pale in comparison to what might have been while the s p 500 rose more than 5 percent , big stocks gained at a much faster pace the dow jones industrial average recorded a total return of 99 percent , nearly double the broader market average much of the first quarter s gains were apparently fueled by the deluge of cash into mutual funds domestic equity funds collected more money in the first two months than they had in any previous threemonth stretch with demand for stocks soaring and many american companies continuing to repurchase their shares , fund managers are looking well beyond the biggest stocks for shares to buy the lists of best performers over the latest quarter and year are littered with funds that invest heavily in small initial public offerings , and are remarkably devoid of the biggest and most widely held funds , which have been attracting most of the new cash from 401 \( k \) retirement plans i do n't know why there are n't more largercap names in there , said james mccall , manager of the pbhg large cap growth fund , lamenting the lack of similar funds on the lists of the quarter s top performers the money flows into mutual funds are very strong , and managers have to put money to work quickly often the only way they can do that is to buy big names and foreign dollars flowing into the market also like largecap companies but funds that focus on the biggest stocks have performed moderately at best so far this year some , like the fidelity magellan fund , the country s biggest , looked downright dismal the magellan fund rose 17 percent , placing it near the bottom in its category the divergence between the funds receiving the most money and those performing the best might eventually breed unrest among american investors what history shows , however , is that investors rarely pull back from mutual funds before the market turns even in 1987 , money started flowing out only after stock prices fell , said melissa r brown , director of quantitative research at prudential securities when you get big surges of money flowing into the market , that s when the market seems to peak none of those cautions , however , seem to dim the ardor of the fund managers who lead the list of winning stock funds in the latest quarter randall e haase , comanager of the alliance capital quasar fund , the bestperforming diversified stock fund in the latest quarter , said the recent outperformance of largecap stocks gives him hope that the smaller stocks he prefers will move back into the spotlight the quasar fund reaped much of its 1875 percent firstquarter gain from what mr haase called contrarian bets on two sectors that had been badly beaten down in recent years natural gas drilling contractors and airlines looking ahead , selected stocks in similarly outoffavor industries , like retailing and , more recently , solidwaste disposal , could be further contributors to the quasar fund s success , mr haase said those winning ways date back beyond the most recent quarter the fund has gained 646 percent over the last year , better than all but three other diversified stock funds tracked by morningstar we try to keep away from companies that have big valuations and that are story' stocks , he said we do n't buy microbreweries , we do n't buy 'concept' restaurants , we do n't buy satellites and wireless cable companies as a result , we 've been able to keep away from many bombs and disasters which is not to say that the fund , which outperformed its next closest competitor by more than three percentage points , avoids initial public offerings a big winner has been diamond offshore drilling , which went public in october at 24 and has since doubled but even there , mr haase said , the quasar fund bought the offering at a time when drilling stocks were out of favor , and the deal was not in demand
washington , aug 23 the trumpets will blare across the citadel s stark campus on monday , just as they have since the mid1800 s but to some , this year s starting reveille may sound more like taps as the citadel prepares for another school year , the small but defiant south carolina military college that spent three years and many millions in a fight to keep one woman out will execute an abrupt about face to embrace coeducation after all the heaveho of three years of combat , the abrupt end to the school s allmale tradition is suddenly being portrayed as a boon to the school the addition of female cadets , citadel administrators have said in recent weeks , will increase the pool of candidates , reenergize the institution and help to prepare all citadel students to meet the challenges of the 21st century in fact , it was a matter of survival beginning monday , four women will march not under a court order , as shannon faulkner did alone briefly last year , but at the invitation of a college forced into compliance by a nearunanimous supreme court decision in a similar case and faced with the triple threat of dwindling enrollment , a worsening financial profile and a reputation seriously tarnished by the uproarious celebration that followed ms faulkner s departure after her first week as a knob \( for the way the cadets look after their heads are shaved \) in 1995 we are of course , hoping that this time things go very smoothly , said terry leedom , the school s spokesman we had sent letters all across the state and we went back to the 300 or so women who had made inquiries we are now emphasizing that we are now coed the four women who are expected will not arrive in the immediate wake of a bitter and highly personalized court battle as ms faulkner did their names do not appear on tshirts , bumper stickers and banners there is no fund dedicated to defeat them in court they did not even have to go to court this time , they are welcome participants whose entry has been so sudden and so unpublicized that many people close to the case do not even know their names these women are the sort of women that , if they were men , the citadel would be salivating to recruit , said valorie vojdik , a new york university law school professor who has fought the coeducation battle since its start they are really motivated , and they want the military discipline two of the four have allowed the citadel to identify them nancy mace , an 18yearold from goose creek , sc , a military enclave outside the school s home base in charleston is the daughter of a retired army general who is 1963 citadel graduate and the younger sister of one of the first women to attend west point another sister went to a coeducational military college in georgia kim messer , 18 , of clover , sc , also grew up in the military , as the daughter of a noncommissioned officer and a third female knob who signed up just last week shares both a military background and strong citadel connections the fourth , from a washington suburb , lays no claim to a military family but she arrives with a measure of citadel support unthinkable in the case of ms faulkner her application drew the sponsorship of several citadel club members from the northern virginia area who , impressed with her drive and credentials , raised money to help pay her way students are due on campus early on saturday for two days of academic orientation but the real start comes on monday when the military system goes into effect and , along with it , a routine of psychological harassment and rigorous physical demands purposefully structured to break new students down school officials have said they will do all they can to help blend the new students into the corps yet there will be nothing ordinary about them the only women among roughly 1 , 770 men or the tightly sealed universe they will enter at a time when college students are accustomed to more freedoms than ever , theirs will be a fouryear study in discipline so strict that getting off campus requires a special pass finding a few minutes to themselves will be near but impossible , and being caught in even minor transgressions could mean rapid expulsion theirs will be a culture in which picking up school uniforms involves going through a haze maze eating a meal means surviving a barrage of shouted insults , and making a misstep will bring not only correction but a torrent of abuse they join a culture so wedded to its every detail that the school handbook written exclusively for men notes , for instance , that the proper answer to a question about how much milk is left inside a carton \( how is the cow \? \) is the response sir , she walks , she talks , she s full of chalk , the lacteal fluid extracted from the female of the bovine species is highly prolific to the x degree , sir ! with the x indicating the number of glasses left any other answer could draw a severe reprimand the citadel has long venerated sheer virility and rigid obedience to its rules over academic achievement the author william styron , in a short story that mentions a citadel graduate , casually dismissed it as a place where the intellectual level was on a par with that of a night school for the mentally retarded indeed , the acting president , gen r clifton poole , joined the school as a vice president for academic affairs with the mission of shifting the emphasis toward the classroom but the mandate has proved hard to meet
los angeles , sept 30 among other things , the national league playoffs are about rushed laundry , dirty laundry , position rivalries , brother acts and a socalled monopoly of arms the braves and dodgers will play twohour games , the padres and cardinals will play chess games and lefthanded pitchers need not apply st louis and san diego are the teams with the drycleaning issues , literally and figuratively the padres left dodger stadium on sunday in first place and wearing the stench of champagne with their threeoffivegame series against the cardinals opening tuesday afternoon in st louis , their equipment manager had to remove spots from 25 uniforms overnight but there is dirtier laundry san diego s rickey henderson has a history with st louis s tony la russa , st louis s andy benes has a history with san diego s management and none are on speaking terms henderson is still seething because his former oakland manager , la russa , called him a parttime player last season henderson is frothing to play left field ahead of the power hitter greg vaughn in order to make la russa pay as for benes a former san diego no 1 draft pick he never suspected the padres were committed to winning he asked out , they accommodated him last season and he signed with st louis and now look who is coming to busch stadium san diego s hendersonvaughn decision in left is mirrored if not magnified by the one the cardinals have at shortstop , where the retiring ozzie smith will have to wait until tuesday to learn if he will be in the starting lineup for st louis s first postseason game since 1987 la russa said today that he had still not decided whether smith or royce clayton would start smith , whose 19year playing career included the last 15 with the cardinals , was honored during an ozzie smith weekend salute that drew 144 , 000 fans to busch he would like nothing better than to start tuesday , just as he did when the cardinals made the playoffs in 1982 , 1985 and 1987 if ozzie was starting just because it s the playoffs and there s a national television audience and all that , i think ozzie would be insulted , la russa said he would want to play because he s the best player at the position for that game smith , 41 , and la russa had their differences early in the season when it became apparent that clayton , 26 , would be the team s primary shortstop this year but after those early brush fires , smith has offered little resistance to a reduced role royce has a lot of ability he brings to the situation , la russa said ozzie does , too it s been like that all year long that s why we 've had success meanwhile , the cardinals are hoping center fielder ray lankford will be able to play by saturday s game in san diego lankford will miss the first two games after suffering a torn rotator cuff in his left throwing shoulder while making a diving catch friday night lankford , who led the team with 100 runs scored and 35 stolen bases , will be replaced in center by either willie mcgee or john mabry , who is usually a first baseman st louis took 8 of 12 meetings with san diego this year , and its earned run average against the padres was an overwhelming 278 but the cardinals' game 1 starter , todd stottlemyre , was 03 with a 750 era in his nine postseason games with toronto their game 2 starter , benes , gave up 13 runs in 14 innings in the last postseason for seattle so , their most reliable pitcher may be the only lefthanded starter in the series donovan osborne , who slashed a hand on a jagged bottle of champagne in st louis s celebration meanwhile , the bravesdodgers series which opens wednesday in los angeles will be a virtual arm olympics atlanta has had a monopoly on starting pitching and has the 24game winner john smoltz , but the dodgers' team era is shockingly comparable ramon martinez , who starts game 1 for los angeles , won his last seven decisions and was 31 against the braves but the braves own something the dodgers do not a lefthanded starter \( tom glavine \) , and maybe two \( denny neagle \) this means that atlanta s lefthanded power fred mcgriff , ryan klesko and the switchhitting chipper jones will see a steady diet of righthanded starters \( martinez , ismael valdes and hideo nomo \) if nothing else , the national league playoffs are about several functional as opposed to dysfunctional families there are the gwynn brothers in san diego \( tony and chris \) , the benes brothers in st louis \( andy and alan \) and the worrell brothers \( tim of the padres and todd of the dodgers \) just be glad atlanta does n't have a smoltz twin , tony gwynn said photo royce clayton , left , john mabry and brian jordan during a cardinals workout yesterday in st louis in preparation for today s playoff game against the padres \( associated press \)
new discoveries about the earliest signs of alzheimer s disease in the brain may one day offer a way to make the diagnosis well before the disease has produced senility , allowing people to make plans for their futures while they are still lucid although such a diagnosis is not possible at the moment , studies with two brain imaging techniques , the pet scan and mri , have shown early changes in the brain that seem to be precursors of alzheimer s disease in one study , dr gary small , a psychiatrist at the university of california at los angeles , recruited 42 volunteers who were concerned about mild problems like misplacing household objects and who had a parent or sibling who had had alzheimer s disease the volunteers were as young as 41 , with an average age of 60 dr small and his colleagues made pet scans of the volunteers at a time when all of them were able to function normally in their lives , but were also beginning to notice troublesome lapses in memory the lapses showed up on tests , for example , as slight difficulties in repeating a list of 10 words or in drawing a geometric figure seen a few minutes before three years later , the same people were given the same series of neurological tests , and the results were compared with those of their earlier pet scans those who in the meantime had undergone rapid mental deterioration suggesting the development of alzheimer s disease had pet scans that revealed a common trajectory the results were published in the december issue of the american journal of psychiatry in the earliest stage the pet , \( positron emission tomography \) scans showed a lessening of brain activity on one or another side of the neocortex , the brain s topmost layer , in the parietal region just beneath the crown from there the pattern of diminished activity spread systematically as the disease progressed it begins with a difference when you compare the right and left sides of the brain at the parietal area , dr small said you see a worsening of function on one side or the other in righthanded people , if activity is poorer on the right , you 'll start to see a deficit in spatial memory , like for shapes if it s on the left , you 'll see poorer memory for words over time , dr small found , pet scans track a systematic rippling of the decrease in brain activity from the crown , spreading next down either side and the back of the neocortex , and then to the front toward the temporal cortex , just behind the temples the temporal cortex is where the hippocampus is , which is critically involved in memory , dr small said if you do an mri of people with alzheimer s disease , you get an anatomical portrait of shrinkage finally , spreading beyond the temporal cortex , the decreased brain activity reaches the prefrontal cortex behind the forehead , which is the seat of the mind s executive activities , like decision making and planning the pet scans appear to offer a way to discriminate the progression toward alzheimer s from the normal brain changes typical of aging with normal aging you see a general atrophy of the brain over decades , but not specific to these areas , nor nearly so great in magnitude the changes associated with alzheimer s disease may be detectable as much as two or three years before a clinical diagnosis is possible , dr small said this window could be of great importance , since once the symptoms of the disease begin to be noticeable , mental declines are rapid , often progressing to senility within two or three years it makes good sense to look for early brain markers of alzheimer s disease that are detectable before you see the symptoms themselves , said dr neil buckholtz , acting associate director of the neuroscience and neuropsychology of aging program at the national institute on aging but while the data are promising , researchers say it is premature to put the pet scan method into regular use there s great individual variation in brain patterns , said dr eric reiman , a psychiatrist at the university of arizona school of medicine we wo n't know if this has a clinical role until more and larger longitudinal studies are done right now this is more useful as a research tool than a clinical one last november at the meeting of the society for neuroscience in san diego , dr reiman reported results from another study at the good samaritan regional medical center in phoenix pet scan images of people at high risk for alzheimer s disease showed brain abnormalities similar to those reported by dr small , which were discernible before the gross mental lapses symptomatic of the disease had begun the hope is that the pet scan may one day be offered to people who have higher than normal risks of developing alzheimer s disease because a parent or sibling had it , or who know they have a newly discovered genetic marker for susceptibility to the disease , the apoe4 allele , or variation , on chromosome 19 several laboratories are in a scientific race to establish a method to use brain imaging to make early diagnoses of alzheimer s disease three labs are doing longitudinal studies using mri , which may be more useful as a diagnostic tool than the pet scan , dr buckholtz said with mri you pick up an early atrophy in the hippocampus in people who go on to develop alzheimer s disease the mri may be a more practical diagnostic tool because there are more of them around the country the pet scan uses harmless radioactive isotopes to reflect the amount of glucose used by the brain the more glucose an area of the brain uses , the more active it is mri , or magnetic resonance imaging , uses magnets and radio waves to detect subtle electromagnetic fields in the brain the result is a a precise anatomical snapshot of the brain an early diagnostic indicator of alzheimer s disease may be extremely useful , according to results from a 16year study of 170 older , healthy men and women who were recruited as a comparison group for a project on alzheimer s disease and normal aging in the study , dr john morris and his research team at washington university in st louis asked family members and friends for evaluations of mental ability of those in the comparison group members of the group were also given cognitive tests each year the brains of the 25 in the comparison group who have died were analyzed their average age at death was 71 autopsies found that eight of them had changes in their brains typical of alzheimer s disease , though none of them had done so poorly on their last cognitive assessment that there was any suspicion of the problem this suggests that alzheimer s disease has a presymptomatic phase , where lesions have appeared in the brain but have not reached the critical threshold for cognitive declines to appear , dr morris said commenting on the importance of such studies , dr small said about 85 percent of those 65 or older complain of not remembering names , and about twothirds complain of misplacing things i'm starting to experience the problem in my 40 s our question is , when is this just normal aging and when is it a precursor of worse to come \? photos

differences the darkest area in the lefthand image reflects the highest metabolic rate metabolic activity in this area is significantly depressed in the alzheimer s patient similar differences appear

for years , dr john silber , the former president and now chancellor of boston university , has served as a role model , mentor , colleague and friend to dr peter diamandopoulos , the embattled president of adelphi university yesterday , dr silber took the witness stand to vigorously and sometimes combatively defend dr diamandopoulos s salary and benefits dr silber praised his friend s talent and argued that adelphi was more difficult to administer than harvard harvard is a very complex place , but it does n't take nearly as much effort to run harvard as it does to take over an institution like adelphi , dr silber said it s the difficulty of the job that should determine pay , he said just as in industry , you pay handsomely for those who can achieve a turnaround in an institution , dr silber said there is a premium paid for such talent adelphi s trustees granted dr diamandopoulos 523 , 000 in compensation in 199394 , which the chronicle of higher education ranked as the second highest compensation among the nation s college presidents that year the top position was held by dr silber , at 564 , 020 dr silber long known for his prickly style in academia and politics disputed those rankings that s false , but it was in there , he said of the compensation report i wish it were true it should be true unfortunately , i rank about ninth i say that with great embarrassment he did not specify which college president salaries were omitted from the list his testimony came in a hearing before a new york state board of regents panel reviewing a request from dr diamandopoulos s opponents that adelphi s trustees be removed the critics accuse the trustees of wasting money on his compensation , mismanaging the university and allowing conflicts of interest , with some trustees doing business with adelphi dr silber said he intended to hire dr diamandopoulos as boston university s executive vice president in 1985 but then encouraged him to take adelphi s offer to become its president dr silber recalled his friend hesitating about adelphi s fiscal problems he said this situation may be hopeless , dr silber recalled i said , 'peter , this is the only kind of job worth taking if you 're offered the presidency of harvard , your chances of making a significant contribution are nil they do n't need your help' but at adelphi , dr silber advised him , you have a chance to really leave your mark on that place but dr silber had his doubts about adelphi and initially declined to become a trustee it was not clear that anything could be done to save that institution from bankruptcy , he said , but i became interested as i saw him build that board and turn the situation around and give adelphi a coherent academic identity , which i thought it sorely lacked i began to believe it was possible for peter diamandopoulos to succeed in his plans to save adelphi , dr silver said every year , dr diamandopoulos has operated the budget to create a surplus that by itself is superb i served as a sort of unpaid consultant to peter , dr silber said , adding that , i advise the president on the telephone about four times a week in 1989 , dr silber joined adelphi s board and serves on eight committees and subcommittees , including the executive compensation panel that recommends dr diamandopoulos s pay and benefits but dr silber missed adelphi s board meetings for about two years , according to questioning by amy gladstein , a lawyer for the committee to save adelphi , the group seeking the removal of the trustees part of that period was in 1990 , during his unsuccessful campaign for governor of massachusetts i was well apprised of what was going on through frequent telephone calls , dr silber said he also testified that while he had not donated money to adelphi , as some other trustees have , i have made huge contributions in time asked what universities were comparable to adelphi , dr silber said none posed the same challenges but the closest was his own university i think the problems that peter diamandopoulos faced were very similar to the problems i faced at boston , he said but adelphi was worse because of the intensive , gratuitous abuse inflicted by the faculty union on dr diamandopoulos and prior presidents , dr silber said the compensation must be enough to make him willing to accept that kind of psychic pain , he said you have to give him the incentive to stay the attacks hurt dr diamandopoulos s morale , dr silber said he has certainly metaphorically cried on my shoulder , which is perfectly understandable , dr silber said dr silber defended dr diamandopoulos s sabbatical benefit a sixth of a year s pay for every year worked and scoffed when ms gladstein asked if the president was required to file a report on his work dr silber compared that to asking einstein to file a report he also defended the manhattan condominium that adelphi spent 14 million to buy , renovate and furnish for dr diamandopoulos to use in addition to his free home on the adelphi campus in garden city , li the trustees also gave him the right to buy the condominium for 905 , 000 the board was worried that dr diamandopoulos would become homeless upon retirement , dr silber said ms gladstein asked why dr silber did not advise dr diamandopoulos to take the money he saved from his free campus home and invest it for his retirement residence it would be so insulting and outrageous , i would n't consider it , dr silber said in one of many tart comments in his testimony , dr silber discussed dr diamandopoulos s 125 million life insurance policy and the life expectancy that his own insurance policy was based on i'm sure it s been shortened by today s events , he said photo dr john silber , boston university chancellor , at hearing yesterday \( jack manning the new york times \)
oakland , calif , sept 4 dwight gooden strained and struggled to locate the strike zone against the athletics tuesday night and then manager joe torre strained and struggled to describe the pitcher s fragile status as more glowing than gloomy no matter how optimistic torre sounded , the evidence of another abysmal start was on the oakland coliseum scoreboard after the yankees lost , 109 torre was a convincing witness when he noted that the a s did not pummel many of gooden s pitches and that shortstop derek jeter s two errors on the same play turned an inningending double play into a threerun inning the manager insisted that gooden had better movement on his fastball , barely missed with his pitches and was too pumped up maybe the weary gooden is concerned about being bypassed if the yankees employ three starters in the postseason he was too fine , torre said he was trying to make a perfect pitch i think he 'll be all right a concise gooden , who put the yankees in a 62 hole , added sometimes things do n't go your way if we played that game over , every pitch i threw i 'd do the same way while throwing an unfathomable 132 pitches in four and twothird innings , gooden was raked for eight hits , three walks and five earned runs as much as he was hampered by jeter s miscues , center fielder bernie williams rescued him from yielding at least four more runs with two spectacular catches his arm is fine , torre said he had good stuff he was jumping at hitters he was fidgety as all get out he was choking the ball gooden , whose troubles have been treated differently from kenny rogers s , said he was not too anxious , but recognized the desperate need to improve there s no room for mistakes , said gooden , whose 468 earned run average is the highest it has been since june 4 you have to step it up you have to dog it out and go with what you have right now , gooden does not have much after recording his sixth nodecision in eight games , gooden has logged 159 2 3 innings the yankees should be worried because he had thrown only 49 1 3 innings in 1994 and none in '95 even though the yanks did not concede it , gooden is a fatigued pitcher trying to rediscover the formula that made him effective for four straight nodecisions \( 00 , 205 era \) from july 28 to aug 12 he has thrown 254 pitches in his last two starts but will start on schedule sunday against toronto gooden knows he must find it soon , but he is unsure if the right arm that did not face hitters for almost two years while he was suspended for violating baseball s substance abuse policy will cooperate over gooden s last four starts , the yankees have revealingly slipped him an extra day of rest twice , and he is 11 with a 1100 era and has not lasted more than five and twothird innings in any outing if the postseason started today , torre would undoubtedly pick david cone and andy pettitte as his first two starters and probably choose jimmy key ahead of gooden if torre used four starters , gooden might be chosen before rogers because the 20 million outcast has relieved and because the yankees are bothered by his carefree attitude i'm not thinking about personal things , gooden said i 'll do what i can to help the team i ca n't say i 've got to pitch well in the postseason we 've got to get there first
the compaq computer corporation stunned industry analysts yesterday and sent technology stocks into a tailspin after it announced that earnings for the first quarter would be below expectations because of sluggish sales in february the announcement , which followed similar warnings on thursday from lsi logic , a major semiconductor manufacturer , and intuit , the leading maker of personal finance software , fed fears that the recent bull market for technology stocks might be coming to an end compaq s disclosure was all the more surprising because the company , which is the world s leading seller of personal computers , said that it was suffering from weak demand in what was thought to be its strongest business selling desktop computers and pc servers to corporate customers the company said that it would be forced to lower prices and to spend more on promotions to maintain its share of the market compaq declined to detail the spending and pricing changes , saying they would be announced on monday , when it is scheduled to make some product announcements but the lower profit margins will mean that earnings for the quarter , which ends on march 31 , will be around 80 cents a share , the company said that would be significantly below the average wall street target of about 98 cents a share , according to a survey of analysts by zacks investment research , and unchanged from the comparable quarter a year earlier the announcement sent shares of compaq plunging 175 percent , or 8875 each , to 4175 , in heavy trading yesterday on the new york stock exchange other technology stocks were also battered , even though the overall market rallied 35 ibm fell 450 , to 118125 dell computer dropped 4375 , to 30 cisco systems slid 2 , to 4550 intel slipped 275 , to 560625 , and microsoft lost 31875 , to 9550 intuit plunged 24 percent , or 1625 , to 5050 , in nasdaq trading i think that today was a rather pivotal day for the technology sector , said drew peck , an analyst with cowan company in boston many analysts including mr peck had said that the sector was going through a temporary inventory glut as a result of high expectations for computer sales during the holiday season but now , mr peck said , the industry s sluggishness appeared to be more serious there is no way what you are seeing out there now can be pinned on too many dram s and too many motherboards , he said , referring to two of the principal components that go inside personal computers it s deeper than that the weakness in compaq s corporate sales dashed hopes that business buyers would make up for the disappointing retail sales over the holidays mr peck said that many corporate managers were delaying their buying decisions until a new version of microsoft s windows nt operating system is released at the end of this year but david wu , an analyst with the chicago corporation in new york , said that overall server sales were still strong but that compaq was losing share to hewlettpackard hp is causing a lot of damage out there , he said their prices have been significantly below compaq s , particularly at the high end of the pc server line compaq is the clear leader in sales of pc servers with 36 percent of the market as the desktop computer business has become more competitive in recent years , driving down prices and profits , compaq has depended more and more on server sales for its earnings servers made up 22 percent of the company s revenue last year but 50 percent of its profit , according to analysts larry sennett , a hewlettpackard spokesman , seemed to confirm that the company was gaining share our growth rates since the start of the year are exceeding forecasts , he said , adding that the company had not yet decided whether it needed to lower its prices in response to compaq nevertheless , hewlettpackard shares were not spared from the selloff in technology issues yesterday they closed at 95125 , down 5625 in its statement , compaq said that it expected sales growth in the first quarter to be about 35 percent more than the 296 billion of sales it registered in the first quarter of 1995 but discounts and increased expenses would force gross margins below 217 percent , the level the company had in the fourth quarter of 1995 while market conditions will continue to be competitive , we fully intend to expand our business and grow our market share profitably in 1996 , eckhard pfeiffer , compaq s president and chief executive , said in the statement compaq expects sales , margins and profitability to improve in the remaining quarters of the year but several analysts lowered their earnings estimates for the company yesterday mr wu , who had been forecasting earnings of 490 a share for the year , cut his estimate to 410 and reduced his recommendation on the stock to hold from buy the odds are that things will get better from here , he said but starting at such a low level , it will ruin the year the challenge for compaq now , he added , was to squeeze more profit out of its operations as its gross profit margins decline the company that compaq should emulate , mr wu said , is none other than hewlettpackard hp has shown how to operate at a low gross margin , he said it is not a miracle to have higher operating margins with a lower gross margins graph compaq shows daily closing stock prices for compaq

orlando , fla , march 6 patrick j buchanan may be going down , but he is going down swinging a pitchfork even as he acknowledged today that senator bob dole was almost sure to win the republican presidential nomination , mr buchanan was quoting huey long and plotting a searing protest candidacy that he himself might call american visigothic i'm going to get a pitchfork ! mr buchanan hooted on his campaign plane late tuesday night , reviving a cherished image of rebellion from his glory days in new hampshire , as the extent of mr dole s victory in eight primaries began sinking in i'm going to look like something out of 'deliverance , ' getting off that bus with that pitchfork ! mr buchanan today rejected the idea of mounting a thirdparty candidacy but over and over and , it seemed , louder and louder he declared his intention to keep rattling the republican party right up to its national convention in san diego we 're going to fight until hell freezes over , mr buchanan yelled to about 400 supporters under a sweltering tent in tampa this afternoon , and then we 're going to fight on the ice ! as a sign that he does not plan to give mr dole a free ride , mr buchanan has readied a television advertisement for texas attacking the senator as out of touch with public anxiety about jobs both texas and florida vote on tuesday all day , mr dole was like the punching bag that mr buchanan s father ordered him to slug 1 , 600 times a week when he was a boy anticipating lamar alexander s endorsement of the senator , mr buchanan used one of mr alexander s oftrepeated criticisms of mr dole to poke at the frontrunner this morning before a few dozen supporters assembled in the versailles restaurant in miami s little havana as lamar alexander , the fellow who goes around in the howdy doody shirt , has told you , as lamar alexander says , he has no ideas , mr buchanan said along with a fleeting sense of himself as the frontrunner , mr buchanan s sense of humor was something of a victim of his thirdplace finish in the arizona primary last week but as he returned today to his role from the 1992 campaign as party scold and satirist , the sharp jokes poured forth , salting a stump speech that had grown routine in little havana , mr buchanan described hearing something squawking behind him as he left his hotel this morning it was a parrot , he said , and evidently one with a penchant for stealing the most famous buchanan lines he was talking about a cultural war for the soul of america we 're going to name that parrot bob dole in conversations with reporters today , mr buchanan argued that even if he did not win many delegates , his popular support would guarantee him a powerful role at the convention he 'll be looking at the votes , mr buchanan said of mr dole and that s what they said to bush last time they said , 'why do we got to deal with this guy \? ' and they said , 'well , the guy got three million votes , and we have to deal with his three million voters' so we 're going all out but he continued to hold out the hope of some sort of break that would reignite his candidacy a deus ex machina , in playwright terms , mr buchanan explained he said that if mr dole did not adopt some of his ideas on trade and other issues , the senator would probably face a thirdparty challenge clearly , there is a tremendous movement behind buchanan that is not only inside the republican party , but it s among independents and democrats , and if you have a clintondole race , there will be a vacuum in american politics , he said but he said he would not run as a thirdparty candidate i'm not going to do anything to reelect bill clinton , mr buchanan said that would vitiate a lot of what i did his supporters seem to have lost none of their zeal for the candidate mr buchanan was peppered with shouts of right again , pat ! at his rally in tampa , where he was introduced as the absolute most perfect nominee for the republican party and mr buchanan seized on the enthusiasm to draw a distinction between his campaign and mr dole s you go to a dole rally and think you 're stepping into a funeral parlor , he said at a news conference after the rally , mr buchanan turned jack f kemp s endorsement of steve forbes whom he has repeatedly referred to as forbesby into an attack on mr dole he is a man of ideas , mr buchanan said of mr kemp , and he realizes this party cannot nominate an individual who is bereft of ideas mr buchanan said mr dole had saved his candidacy by defining mr buchanan as an extremist we 're going to define bob dole as the tax collector of the welfare state , he said , as the guy who has raised taxes 16 times , more than clinton ever dreamed of as the guy who repeatedly sold out american workers for the benefit of his corporate friends as someone who talks about right to life but votes for fetal tissue research and so on mr buchanan tailored his message only slightly for florida s voters today , adding fidel castro s appearance at the united nations on its 50th anniversary to his list of complaints about that organization aiming for high ground , mr buchanan repeatedly said today that , unlike his opponents , he was more interested in carrying his cause forward than in winning high office we 're about changing america , changing the republican party , moving the center of gravity in american politics , mr buchanan said at his hotel in miami this morning that s what i think this is about that s why we get in high spirits even after we lose it takes us a couple of hours , but we come right back photo in a hot tent in tampa , fla , yesterday patrick j buchanan keptthe oratory strong , saying , we 're going to fight until hell freezes over , and then we 're going to fight on the ice ! joe mullane and charles white were among those there cheering him on \( associated press \)
belgrade , serbia , nov 27 the serbian president , slobodan milosevic , ignoring protesters in the street , and flouting warnings from the west , pressed ahead today with a new round of voting intended to give his ruling party the victory it was denied at the polls the opposition coalition called for a boycott of today s vote , labeling it a farce after opposition victories were nullified by the government while most polling stations , including the one where the president voted , were deserted , more than 50 , 000 people braved cold rains to take to the streets in protest again , shutting down the center of the city the opposition coalition , known as zajedno , stepped up its protests here by hurling bricks and rocks through the plateglass windows of the staterun television building and the governing party newspaper , politika university students , who have now taken over all city university buildings , burned an american flag in front of the united states embassy to protest what they said was inappropriate support by washington for the serbian leader the united states has not pushed mr milosevic in the last year , in part because of his cooperation in the peace talks in dayton a student leader , zarko mihailovic , said , as a country that says it supports democratic values we expected more from america in washington , the state department did condemn serbia s antidemocratic practices on tuesday we are urging that the decision to annul municipal elections be overturned by president milosevic , said nicholas burns , the state department spokesman western diplomats , some of whom met with president milosevic this morning , said he appeared calm but opaque none walked away from the meeting with any clues about what the serbian government would do next but they said president milosevic acknowledged the seriousness of the crisis and listened to warnings from the west that resorting to violence to put down the protests would harm his relations with the outside world opposition leaders , meanwhile , have been holding meetings with union leaders , including the leaders of the transport union , in an effort to gather support for general strikes while workers have turned out in some industrial cities like nis to back the opposition s call for the president to step down , in the capital , bluecollar backers have not joined the protests opposition leaders said tonight that the support of belgrade s working class was pivotal if the coalition hoped to push the president from power our main task now is to bring the workers in belgrade into the protest , said a senior opposition leader , who spoke on condition of anonymity several hundred special police , sheltered from the rain inside buses and vans , sat in the parked vehicles along the edge of tasmajdanski park they wore gray flak jackets , carried gas masks in pouches strapped to their hips and were armed with automatic weapons at one point this afternoon it looked as if a confrontation might develop the jeering crowd , which usually follows a circular route in its march , began to shout , let s go to dedinje ! referring to the posh , hilly suburb where the president has his home but the marchers turned back when they were blocked by some 1 , 000 heavily armed police officers the opposition coalition asserted victory in 15 of the country s 18 largest cities in runoff polls held on nov 17 but the governmentappointed electoral commissions nullified almost all of the results and called for a third round of voting on tuesday , serbia s supreme court turned down an opposition appeal to overturn the ruling the opposition decided to contest the third round in three towns , jagodina , pirot and uzice , where the disparity in the official count and the actual count was not great zeljko avramovic , a political commentator on the staterun television , criticized the protesters today , saying , this is n't politics , its vandalism , as he picked his way through the shards of glass outside the television building where protesters had broken the windows how can anyone say this kind of action represents a political debate \? what pity can you have for people who resort to this kind of thing \? all this is going too far the opposition cannot control the crowd and has unleashed mobs on belgrade during the protests this afternoon , the city s only independent radio station , radio b92 , went off the air for two hours the silence stunned many in the city who rely on the radio for coverage of daily events university students , many of whom had been listening to the broadcasts on portable radios in the streets , roared their anger and disapproval calls poured into the station , many from demobilized soldiers , who volunteered to come to protect the station it was turned back on , said veran matic , editor in chief of the station but it did not go off by accident when we sent our technicians to the transmitter , the police turned them away this was a test it is a sign that many in the ruling party would like to end this protest with a conflict they believe the police could easily crush in march 1991 , the president faced large street protests after security forces killed two people in a riot in downtown belgrade the protests built for several days but dissipated after the serbian government gave in to the demonstrators' key demands the protests never resumed this is not the first time the president has had to deal with this kind of chaos , said mr avramovic he knows how to deal with these gangs the government is not in jeopardy public order will be restored photo protesters in belgrade tipping a garbage bin into the offices of the national newspaper , politika , yesterday , demonstrated instead of voting in the third round of elections called after opposition victories were nullified \( associated press \)
the collected scorn heaped on the music of sibelius over the years could fill a companion volume to nicolas slo nimsky s famous lexicon of musical invective what is unusual about antisibelius bile is that it has so often stemmed from fellow composers virgil thomson called the second symphony vulgar , selfindulgent , and provincial beyond all description benjamin britten looked at the fourth symphony and said that its composer must have been drunk rene leibowitz , a disciple of schoenberg , called the fifth the worst symphony ever written bartok thought none of the symphonies would last theodor adorno , typically venturing farther than most , accused sibelius of fascistic nature worship repeatedly dismissed as a shallow nordic pictorialist , sibelius has also had his defenders , and over the course of the 20th century his influence has grown stronger alban berg , breaking from the schoenberg party line , found things to like in several sibelius pieces morton feldman loved the opening of the fourth symphony , its long and obsessive scrutiny of four ambiguous notes contemporary figures from john adams to wolfgang rihm to magnus lindberg \( the most impressive of contemporary finnish composers \) have admired sibelius not as a painter of pictures but as an original thinker , one who evolved radical methods of interweaving orchestral sonorities and mobilized harmonies at the edge of conventional tonality one contribution toward a more serious image of sibelius has been the cd survey of the composer s complete works on the swedish label bis the project began with sibelius s bestknown orchestral music then it ventured , with less fanfare , into occasional and minor pieces but in the last couple of years , bis has turned to unpublished manuscripts , producing major discoveries incidental music for the tempest and everyman original versions of the violin concerto and the fifth symphony , and an unknown early tone poem entitled the wood nymph the sheer boldness of this music is sometimes shattering in effect sibelius finished the wood nymph in 1894 , after his early choral symphony kullervo briefly put , the story is of a handsome lad bereaved by an insincere nymph the idiom is roughhewn , brutally direct much of the 20minute piece is given over to long , relentlessly churning ostinatos despite a few shaky transitions , it is by no means a failure , as sibelius evidently thought it has the same dark , primeval thrust of kullervo , together with mighty , rustic fanfares , which suggest that sibelius had been studying bruckner the disk also includes a shortened wood nymph melodrama and sibelius s music to the strindberg play swanwhite \( bis 815 \) hearing the fourmovement first version of the fifth symphony is a surreal experience , rather like looking at a familiar landscape that has been rearranged by natural disaster sometimes the initial version employs more conventional gestures \( steady tremolos and a timpani roll in the final measures , where the second version has a stunning alternation of fortissimo and silence \) but elsewhere sibelius lets weirdness run riot there are startling dissonant ornaments in the finale s main thematic statement , a semitone off key although this fifth cannot replace the finished product , it speaks to the raw strength of sibelius s imagination \( bis 800 with the original version of en saga \) everyman \( jedermann \) poses a different problem can a musical narrative cohere from pieces intended to serve in the background of a play \? certainly this score for a 1916 production of hugo von hofmannsthal s streamlined morality play contains odd jumps and transitions short , atmospheric fragments cry out for dramatic context but several extended movements delve into the severe , static , semiatonal idiom of the fourth symphony it is no surprise that sibelius makes a great , cold string threnody out of the seductive advance of the devil in the original symbolist staging , this must have been a chilling moment of theater but the everyman score goes farther a misterioso fugue for muted strings , representing the dialogue of everyman and good works , sounds like nothing so much as the opening fugue of bartok s music for strings , percussion and celesta , written 20 years later even more surprising is a coolly flowing chorale for organ and strings , dominated by a hypnotic downward scale , showing the rescue of everyman s soul sibelius had command not only of his peculiar nordic idiom but also of an encyclopedia of competing styles exuberant eclecticism comes forward again in the orientalist music for belshazzar s feast , which rounds out the disk \( bis 735 \) these sometimes fragmentary scores take on luster through the exceptionally polished playing of the provincial lahti symphony , under the direction of osmo vanska , and also through bis s vivid sound as a concert with the iceland symphony at carnegie hall confirmed last february , mr vanska is one of the most important contemporary interpreters of sibelius he seeks out the darker , knottier aspects of the composer s sound while keeping hold of the larger structure anyone with more than a passing interest in sibelius must know this series a note in closing the most impressive effort in bis s series remains the complete recording of the tempest , from several years back sibelius s score for the shakespeare play was one of his final statements before a 30year retreat into creative silence he must have seen something of himself in prospero , who sets aside his magic powers i 'll break my staff , i 'll drown my book in this score he writes music of drowning , music of sleep , music of renunciation the tempest is perhaps his most deeply felt creation , an unsettlingly perfect meeting of text and sound photo jean sibelius in 1948 everyman shows command not only of his peculiar nordic idiom but also of many competing styles \( keystone pictures \)
washington after several days in a prison near baghdad in 1991 , i was told they wanted to see me blindfolded , i was led into a room where , judging from the voices , there were at least half a dozen men for days , i had heard and sometimes watched as guards beat and tortured iraqi prisoners the translator asked what my real job was i'm a reporter for the village voice and cbs news radio , i said he translated my response in arabic i heard the reply from a man whose voice sounded older and less sympathetic you 're lying , the translator echoed in english tell us about your relationship with the cia i had none the interrogation lasted two hours i was not abused the iraqis found me guilty of entering their country without a visa i had admitted sneaking in from syria after the persian gulf war with kurdish guerrillas who wanted to overthrow president saddam hussein as for the charge of being a cia agent , i remained under suspicion , i was told a week later , iraq let me leave last week , a blueribbon panel , sponsored by the council on foreign relations , proposed repealing a 19year policy that prevents cia agents from posing as representatives of the working press part of the panel s rationale is that the cia s use of american embassies as a cover wo n't wash any longer skeptical foreign officials are asking why an embassy that issues relatively few visas has so many consular officials , why the political section has doubled in size or whether that new department is really doing economic research the panel director , richard n haass , a former member of the national security council , asks whether precluding the use of journalism as a cover is a luxury the united states can still afford \( leslie h gelb , a former new york times columnist who is president of the council on foreign relations , disagrees with the proposal \) the cia supposedly terminated the practice in 1977 , but last month the agency admitted that the practice has continued on extraordinarily rare occasions , it says if the iraqis had been aware of this during the war , any of the 47 or so journalists picked up and held by authorities might not have come back \( one did n't gad gross , a freelance photographer , was executed minutes after soldiers captured him \) if agents began regularly passing themselves off as reporters again , governments around the globe could easily accuse almost any american reporter of being a cia plant the burden of proof would fall on the journalist to demonstrate that he or she is not a spy the council s proposal , if adopted , would make it easy for any hostile official who fears inquiries by the foreign press to accuse reporters of being spies the most probing reporters may well be denied entry or expelled the council s panel concluded that if spooks could get press credentials , the cia would be more effective but many academics and policy makers seem to agree that the information available in the media is often as good as , if not better than , that found in classified cia documents are n't many offices in the pentagon and elsewhere always tuned to cnn \? allowing cia agents to pose as journalists not only needlessly puts reporters at risk but also undermines their ability to report foreign news properly or at all , limiting the information available to policy makers and the public instead of rehabilitating this passe cold war practice , the cia should be ordered to end it for real

the rcn corporation , a fledgling media company that is challenging time warner and nynex in the cable and telephone business , faces a murky future after the government rejected an application by one of its sister companies to transmit video over telephone wires mfs communications , an alternative provider of local phone service , has leased its fiber optic wires to rcn to allow it to sell a package of 105 cable channels in new york city and boston but on friday , the federal communications commission denied a request by mfs for permission to transmit video over these fiber optic networks if the fcc does not reconsider its decision , rcn could lose its primary pipeline to its cable and telephone customers rcn , which is based in princeton , nj , and owned by the cable operator ctec corporation has sold combined cable and phone service to about 3 , 000 residential customers in new york and boston since last summer mfs and rcn are backed by peter kiewit sons inc , a privately held conglomerate based in omaha in its ruling , the fcc said that mfs might have misrepresented itself in its application as an open video system operator , when it was , in fact , running a conventional cable system to qualify as an open video system operator , mfs would have to give programmers other than rcn unfettered access to its system but rcn is the only programmer that uses the mfs network which prompted lawyers for time warner inc and the cablevision systems corporation to argue in complaints filed with the fcc that mfs was , in effect , a cable operator cable operators can deny access to programmers , but they must receive a municipal franchise to operate as a monopoly distributor typically , they must also pay 3 to 5 percent of gross revenues to a municipality in return for licenses and they must turn over several channels for publicinterest and leasedaccess programming mfs has not applied for a cable franchise in new york or boston nor has it allocated any channels for nonrcn programming they want to get into the cable business , but they would like to do it without getting bogged down in any local regulations , said richard aurelio , the president of time warner s new york city cable system in addition to time warner and cablevision , the national cable television association and the city of new york argued that mfs was a cable operator rather than an open video systems operator jean kiddoo , a lawyer for mfs , denied that the company was masquerading as an open video systems operator she said she was confident that the fcc would approve the company s application to be an open video system operator as soon as mfs submitted more information ms kiddoo said that mfs had held talks with other programmers about using its network , but that none had reached an agreement while mfs resubmits its application to the fcc , rcn said it would continue to sign up new cable customers this will not affect rcn s operations or the service it offers its customers , said valerie haertel , a spokeswoman for the company rcn made a splash when it entered the new york market in july by opening a 10 , 000squarefoot showroom and network operations center in an office tower at 1133 avenue of the americas , between west 43d and 44th streets the company also took control of liberty cable , a wireless cable company that has waged a davidandgoliath battle for customers against time warner liberty , which has about 37 , 000 customers , is not affected by the fcc ruling
bellsouth and time warner announced a sweeping agreement yesterday that would allow time warner to offer local telephone service throughout the southeastern united states the deal is the latest in a raft of agreements struck by regional bell companies to open their local phone networks in the wake of the new telecommunications law under the terms of yesterday s deal , bellsouth and time warner will connect their networks , so that a bellsouth customer could complete a call to a time warner customer last week , the ameritech corporation announced a similar agreement with mfs communications , a competitive access provider , to open its local network in the midwest and on monday , bell atlantic said it would connect its local network in virginia with that of the local cable operator in that region , jones intercable with these deals from bellsouth , bell atlantic and ameritech , you can see that the telecom act is working , said lawrence strickling , the vice president of public policy at ameritech but while executives at the baby bells are eager to portray each of these arrangements as a competitive milestone , analysts and industry executives noted that even taken together they would not guarantee freewheeling competition in local telephone service in the bellsouth deal , for example , time warner said it planned to offer local phone service in only three of bellsouth s nine states florida , north carolina and tennessee moreover , bellsouth has yet to sign an interconnection deal with mfs communications , which offers telephone service to the lucrative business market throughout the country although ameritech signed a deal with mfs , it has failed to come to terms with time warner , which is eager to offer residential phone service in ohio and none of the bell companies has struck a deal with att , which is seeking to lease capacity on their local networks at a discount and then offer local phone service under the att brand name what s going on now is simply posturing on the part of the baby bells to comply with the legal requirements to offer longdistance service , said p william bane , a telecommunications consultant at mercer management consulting in washington according to the telecommunications act passed by congress in february , the baby bells can begin offering longdistance service after they show they have opened their local networks to such new rivals as longdistance providers and cabletelevision operators if anything , the patchwork of deals underscores that neither the bells , nor their new competitors , are a monolithic group while mfs is angling for the business market , time warner is aiming at consumers and while mfs and time warner are building their own networks to offer local service , att plans to lease most of its capacity from the bells
he rarely finished anything he started , he was frequently distracted by inconsequential minutiae , and he has vexed scholars for four centuries with his cryptic eccentricities but leonardo da vinci embodied the very spirit of the renaissance , and his brilliantly erratic career is the subject of a fascinating new exhibition at the american museum of natural history in manhattan the centerpiece of the exhibition , which opens tomorrow , is a 72page manuscript by leonardo covering both sides of 18 linenpaper sheets , known as the codex leicester this immortal echo of renaissance greatness was purchased at auction two years ago by william h gates 3d , chairman of the microsoft corporation , for 308 million since his purchase of the document from the armand hammer museum of art and cultural center in los angeles , mr gates has lent it for shows at museums in milan and rome the exhibition at the museum of natural history , which will continue until jan 1 , is the manuscript s only scheduled public showing in the united states leonardo s codex leicester a masterpiece of science necessarily glosses over most of the master s artistic career , which created two of the most famous of all paintings , the last supper and the mona lisa \( a codex is an old book manuscript in the form of unbound sheets \) the codex leicester \( named for the first earl of leicester , whose family owned it for two centuries \) also includes none of leonardo s famous anatomical dissertations or descriptions of his military and aeronautical inventions , which are in collections at windsor castle and elsewhere the codex leicester , one of about 20 codices leonardo completed , is a hodgepodge of scientific speculation , engineering ideas and penandink sketches the master set down between 1506 and 1510 when he was in his 50 s \( leonardo lived from 1452 to 1519 \) like all the other codices , this one was written as a disjointed collection of notes for a future book , which leonardo never got around to writing if the manuscript could be said to have a central theme , it is water flowing water , water under pressure , water as the shaper of the earth s surface , and water as a metaphor for the blood that circulates through the bodies of people and animals leonardo viewed the earth as a kind of living organism sustained by processes analogous and related to those of the human organism \( his thinking seems to have prefigured the gaia notion of a living earth proposed in recent years by dr lynn margulis and dr james e lovelock \) but the manuscript takes up many other matters , including discussions of the nature of moonlight , novel designs for pile drivers and cranes , and the question of why fossil shellfish are sometimes found on mountain tops \( leonardo rejected the argument that shellfish were deposited on mountains by the biblical flood he reasoned correctly that because such fossils were found sorted out by species into definite colonies rather than jumbled together , the shellfish must have been transported by largescale geological processes \) the central room housing the leonardo exhibition , on the museum s third floor , is devoted to the doublesided manuscript itself , its 18 sheets displayed separately in sealed glass cases humidity and temperature are closely regulated and a hidden security system protects them from theft because prolonged exposure to light can damage the old paper and ink , each case is brightly illuminated for only one minute at a time , between longer intervals of very dim light the manuscript room , painted a dark blue , is decorated with dividers suggestive of renaissance archways , and quotations and aphorisms of leonardo are projected on pillars above the display cases leonardo s curious script , which runs through all his manuscripts , including this one \( but not his personal correspondence \) , has been the focus of many scholarly surmises like some of the writing in manuscripts of lewis carroll , the author of through the looking glass , leonardo s script is backward mirror writing , legible only when held up to a mirror psychologists and historians agree that leonardo probably did not use mirror writing to conceal his meaning , but that because of some cerebral quirk related to his lefthandedness , it was natural and comfortable for him to write from right to left and with the letters reversed fortunately , a bank of computers provides visitors to the leonardo exhibition with enlarged views of the cramped original mirror text in italian , together with its mirrorcorrected version and an english translation by carlo pedretti visitors can watch an eightminute video summarizing some of leonardo s career , and in another room , museum experts under myles gordon , director of the department of education , working in collaboration with the eli whitney museum in new haven , have assembled a collection of working models illustrating some of leonardo s observations most of these demonstration models have to do with water , and the room s floor has been specially treated and graded to minimize damage from potential spills handson exhibits include an ingenious box containing a bag full of water and an array of levers and weights the device permits a museum visitor to demonstrate leonardo s correct conclusion that the higher a column of water , the greater the pressure it exerts
shady , ny one of woodstock s many current attractions is monarch butterflies another is pleinair sculpture both are available at the elena zang gallery , which requires a detour to this tiny hamlet , four miles west of woodstock on route 212 although it houses a show by contemporary artists , the gallery is upstaged by its terraced garden , which comes with babbling brook , trees and the sculpture exhibition foreground distractions to the contrary , this begins with the view beyond the bridge across the brook , centering on a sculpture by tom doyle it is rare to find an outdoor show in the northeast that does not include mr doyle , and alesia , a group of three or four tree limbs pared of their bark and intermittently planed is a typical piece , atypically installed most doyles are left to their own devices in open settings , but this 15footlong , mantislike form is poised on a grassy plateau , so that the redness of the wood contrasts with the darkness of the copse behind not until they stand on the same level , will visitors realize that the sculpture , so far from being alone , is all but surrounded by smaller works all are well chosen but none are more impressive than those by martin puryear and mia westerlund mr puryear s is a castiron form rusted bright orange it lies low in the grass , a rounded shape that nonetheless gives the impression of a bud in the process of burgeoning an appropriate contradiction for a sculptor who seems never to do the same thing twice on the other hand , ms westerlund s group of disks , about four feet in diameter and made of concrete veneered with lead , is a fait accompli the three would be as demure as a chorus line were it not for the nipples that protrude from either side of the middle disk intimations of the erotic are everywhere in ms westerlund s work , as they are in the paintings of georgia o'keeffe , but the sculptor has a sense of humor , and while she is no surrealist , the combination of the two qualities place her in the company of arp and miro not so , mary frank , whose sensuality seems born of dreams and fantasies to the extent that they are nymphs crossed with egyptian queens , ms frank s women resemble those painted by the late robert beauchamp in his early years their faces are masks , and their bodies , fragmented , tend to merge with the drapery enhancing them whether or not they symbolize spiritual disquiet , the formal elisions and disjunctions that make up the bronzes in this show do nothing to disrupt the overall impression of unnatural tranquillity the only one that does that is the silvery figure lying alone in the grass perhaps i have overdosed on real crime stories , but this pale form lying some distance from the charmed circle looked like another murder victim to me also on the plateau are two works by william tucker and ron mehlman , both on waisthigh pedestals mr tucker s is a vigorously modeled mass cast in putteecolored bronze , which appears to represent a pair of lovers mr mehlman s is a laborintensive structure in which slabs with nubbed surfaces and edges that are variously straight , serrated and deeply indented stand on similar forms laid horizontally jeff shapiro dodges the issue of craft masquerading as art by sandwiching a small bronze lantern between two large stones , chipped like paleolithic flints the result is an engaging assemblage , which looks like a comment on the way time can transform a utilitarian object into a work of art viewers leaving the plateau by way of the flagstone staircase will see sandra mackintosh s brancusilike totem compiled of six blue stone rectangles , each pierced by a circular hole but no two identical at the bottom , they will find anthony krauss s leaning tetrahedron , which is all dark gray concrete until a foot or two from the top , where it turns into mirror steel , and , hans van de bovenkamp s ribbon of golden bronze flying off a quadrihedron of black steel then , back over the brook to a lawn with a giant upended tree trunk this is a work of nature , as is the golden lichen on its rear side but the red , orange and yellow paint mottling the apex and continuing downward in stripes was added by gillian jagger , who recently starred at the katonah museum of art veterans of the pelham art center s preferred seating who were impressed by alan siegel s huge stainless steel

musoma , tanzania aug 22 outsiders have often criticized african governments for doing little to halt disasters in their midst , such as the largescale massacres in rwanda and burundi , let alone to oppose military coups and support democracy but now in east africa , regional leaders are making a serious effort to confront the leaders of the recent coup in burundi by imposing a trade embargo on the country the driving force behind the embargo is julius k nyerere , the former president of tanzania and an elder statesman in african politics mr nyerere had been trying to mediate an impasse between tutsi and hutu parties in burundi since february , and had persuaded regional leaders to agree in june to a plan to send peacekeeping troops into the country to stop massacres and when maj pierre buyoya , a tutsi leader and former burundian president , ousted the sitting president , a hutu , and dismantled the government a month ago , mr nyerere led the drive for an embargo the east african leaders said , one , we are not going to accept the idea that this is a coup by a nice man , mr nyerere , 74 , said in an hourlong interview at his home near here this week secondly , they did not want to simply issue another statement of strong words they really felt action was necessary the decision by tanzania , kenya , uganda , rwanda and zaire to impose trade sanctions on burundi two weeks ago caught many western diplomats by surprise for once , african countries had taken the initiative and staked the high moral ground , while the united states and europe hesitated some western diplomats argued an embargo might provoke more violence and would hurt the poor they also viewed mr buyoya as a moderate , a better alternative than more extremist tutsi military commanders who might have seized power , and argued that the previous government had not been stemming the ethnic warfare there in any case mr nyerere said the decision to impose sanctions was a completely new development in africa during my phase of leadership in the past , he said , african nations had been loathe to interfere in the affairs of their neighbors indeed , the charter of the organization of african unity prohibits any intervention in the affairs of other african nations neighbors usually accepted most coups without a whimper or they paid lip service to condemning them without taking concrete action mr nyerere broke that tradition in 1979 , when he sent 50 , 000 tanzanian troops into uganda to end idi amin s murderous dictatorship the invasion was warranted , he argued , because mr amin had tried the year before to occupy a sliver of tanzania the tradition of noninterference was also broken in liberia , where an 8 , 000strong peacekeeping force led by nigeria has been trying since 1990 to halt the civil war there but the force has been criticized for having less than lofty motives , since some say it has looted the country of goods from machinery to minerals the embargo of burundi seems to have purer roots here , diplomats said democracy has grown stronger in east africa in recent years , and many leaders now see coups as a threat , mr nyerere said in may , uganda held its first presidential election ever , giving a strong mandate to president yoweri k museveni in the last four years , both kenya and tanzania have also held multiparty elections for the first time even zaire s longtime dictator , mobutu sese seko , is planning to hold elections next year none of these elections has been a flawless democratic exercise , mr nyerere acknowledged none has even led to a change of leadership but they have given leaders in the region what they see as a democratic mandate , he said , and so they can no longer so easily accept coups meant to cancel out the voters' wishes in addition , mr nyerere said , the genocide in rwanda in 1994 has deeply affected the politics of the region in hindsight , he said , many regional leaders believe they should have intervened to stop hutu supremacists from massacring at least 500 , 000 tutsi , instead of watching from the sidelines , as much of the world did there is a new leadership developing in africa , he said they are saying 'what does this mean \? this noninterference what does it mean \? who is sovereign in the country the people \? or the junta \? mr nyerere said he was slightly surprised by the lack of support the east african leaders have gotten from western diplomats , who have balked at joining the embargo or condemning the coup the western nations were worried sanctions had been applied too quickly and might provoke more violence in burundi , where more than 150 , 000 people are estimated to have been killed since 1993 in clashes between the mostly tutsi army and hutu rebels or in the widespread abuses of civilians committed by both sides some western diplomats also wanted to give major buyoya more time , to see what he would do with his position , mr nyerere said they saw him as a moderate man , more likely to make peace with hutu leaders than some other more militant tutsi military leaders east african leaders are not totally convinced of this , mr nyerere said

new delhi when indian athletes arrive in atlanta for the olympic games , they will be daunted , as well as spurred , by one of the most disappointing sporting records of any major nation with 930 million people , india is the world s most populous country after china it has a climate that for much of the year is ideal for outdoor sports , and a natural muscularity and physical grace among its people that is visible on every city street and village pathway and because india is desperately poor , sports are a potential ladder out of a life of grinding deprivation but unlike china , which will arrive at the games with one of the largest and strongest contingents of athletes , india will reach atlanta with fewer than 50 athletes , and a credible chance of winning only a single medal , in men s field hockey the atlanta games , carried live on indian state television and on one of the privately owned satellite television channels that are an important part of india s growing links with the world , are likely to hammer home a message indians have been learning in other fields of endeavor that decades of selfimposed isolation have left india behind even its closest asian neighbors it is a painful lesson , and one that makes indians all the more keen for international success every country wants a winner , and there have been a lot of disappointments , said cedric d souza , coach of the 16man field hockey team , whose recent resurgence has ignited hopes of an upswing in fortunes in atlanta india will be competing for a medal with at least five other highly rated teams , including its traditional rivals pakistan , australia , germany , the netherlands and south korea in past decades field hockey was virtually owned by india , which won the last of its eight olympic golds in the boycotted moscow games of 1980 since then , its best olympic performance was fifth place , in los angeles in 1984 in barcelona , spain , in 1992 it could do no better than seventh , its worst placing since an indian team made its first appearance at the olympics in 1928 to measure the impact , imagine that the united states , an olympics or two from now , became an alsoran in basketball after the barcelona games , where china won 54 medals , japan and south korea 22 each and india none , the country s leading news magazine , india today , summed up the mood of national selfreproach with a cover story that chronicled the lack of financing of sports , bureaucratic inertia among government sporting bodies and widespread demoralization among athletes the article carried a telling headline a shocking mess things have changed little since , except in hockey bureaucrats with little or no personal sporting background continue to rule the sports authority of india , established in 1984 in an attempt to develop a national sports policy money remains pitifully inadequate , with barely 1 million from the government for the indian olympic effort some olympic sports are coached at the national level by parttimers , or by people drafted from other disciplines typical of many , the canoeing coach , p t thomas , was a swimmer until he was drafted into his job in 1994 the situation is rooted in wider disappointments when the congress party was routed in a general election last month , losing power for only the third time since independence in 1947 , voters registered a deeprooted dismay with the endemic corruption and inefficiency of indian life failures that have left a majority of indians living in poverty and illiteracy have left their mark on sports , too looking back , many indians say that the country s sporting successes in the first three decades after 1947 owed much to a huge pool of natural talent and to a sporting legacy left behind by britain , the colonial power whose soldiers popularized hockey and cricket , among other sports by the 1980 s , nations that india once met on level terms had made sporting success a priority china and other nations boosted sports budgets , built new training facilities and stadiums and adopted modern coaching techniques the cost of india s failure was measured at the asian games , the competition that takes place every four years between the summer games for the 1982 asian games , held in new delhi , the government built a 75 , 000seat athletics stadium named after the first prime minister , jawaharlal nehru , and india s team responded by winning 13 gold medals by 1990 , in beijing , this had slipped to one in 1994 , in hiroshima , there were no golds indignities abounded the few who could make a living in sports earned rockbottom salaries the equivalent of about 225 a month for a national coach , less than half as much for an athlete at competitions in india , many had to bunk down overnight on stadium floors equipment was often old , or substandard , and when competitions were over , athletes had to return home by train often , this involved days of traveling , sometimes in 120degree heat field hockey , considered by many indians as the national sport , suffered along with everything else once the slide began , after 1980 , there seemed to be no bottom in barely a decade , the national team went through half a dozen coaches the turnaround came in 1994 , with the appointment of a powerhouse president for the indian hockey federation , k p s gill , and a new coach , d souza , who combined with a new crop of players to haul the team back to the top level
the details of accusations made by a former research chief of the brown williamson tobacco corporation against the company and senior executives became public yesterday with the disclosure of a transcript of sealed testimony he gave in a deposition in mississippi in the transcript , jeffrey s wigand , who led the company s research from 1989 to 1993 , offered specifics about his contentions that the company and senior executives had engaged in a variety of abuses , including perjury , destruction of evidence , quashing research into safer cigarettes , reckless use of possibly harmful additives and violations of export controls mr wigand s testimony was taken as part of the pretrial preparations in mississippi s lawsuit against brown williamson and other tobacco companies seeking compensation for treatment the state has made for tobaccorelated illnesses although the broad outlines of mr wigand s accusations had been widely reported , the transcript made it clear why antitobacco lawyers had been delighted with the deposition when it was taken last november according to the transcript , mr wigand told the lawyers that thomas e sandefur jr , the recently retired chief executive of brown williamson , a subsidiary of bat industries and the nation s thirdlargest cigarette maker , repeatedly said in private conversations between 1989 and 1993 that nicotine was addictive and that the company was in the nicotine delivery business if true , such statements would support claims by antitobacco groups that mr sandefur committed perjury in 1994 , when he told a congressional subcommittee that he did not believe nicotine was addictive in the transcript , mr wigand supported previously publicized contentions that brown williamson lawyers improperly controlled research programs in an effort to limit potential liability in injury lawsuits filed against the company even more damaging , if true , would be mr wigand s statement that j kendrick wells , the company s assistant general counsel , destroyed potential evidence in such cases mr wigand s deposition was suspended after one day by agreement of the parties to let him return to work , before the state s lawyers could complete their questioning or the tobacco companies could crossexamine him the transcript of the deposition was disclosed in the wall street journal yesterday , which released the full text on its internet site thomas bezanson , who represented brown williamson at the deposition , said yesterday in an interview without crossexamination , the testimony is untested a lot of it is demonstrably false , but this man is making a career out of fooling the press and flouting the law the company has already stepped up its efforts to discredit mr wigand , who is 53 and now is a high school teacher in louisville , ky a lawyer for the company , gordon smith of the firm of spaulding king in atlanta , said about mr wigand what he says about brown williamson is not true and he s not credible wigand has lied about his education , his job history , his scientific achievements and even his athletic accomplishments mr smith went on to say that mr wigand has been sued for failure to pay child support and was the subject of complaints about spousal abuse and shoplifting lawyers for mr wigand , the highestranking former tobacco official to turn on the industry , responded that none of those accusations against him had ever been pursued and that the company was trying to smear his name to divert attention mr smith also said the company was considering all options for a legal response but had not determined what was feasible how much of what mr wigand has to say will ever be admissible in the mississippi case or any other is unclear for now brown williamson objected vehemently to many of the questions posed during the deposition , preserving its right to challenge their use in court if the case is not settled , it is likely that mr wigand will be led over the same ground in testimony in open court the only cases in which the deposition would now be admissible are mississippi s action and a lawsuit filed by the heirs of burl butler , a nonsmoking mississippi barber who died of lung cancer that his heirs attribute to exposure to his customers' smoking the butler case is scheduled for trial this spring while no trial date has been set in the state s case but the disclosure of mr wigand s testimony could have wider impact although antitobacco lawyers handling other lawsuits say they knew in general what mr wigand had to say , easy access to the details could help them organize their own complaints the leak could also increase public pressure on the justice department to pursue criminal or civil complaints against brown williamson or some of its executives mr wigand has already testified before federal grand juries in new york and washington and given his information to the food and drug administration
the united states open , always the roughest go of the four grand slams , and always the slam whose competitors rarely resist the urge to behave more like critics than mere players , has outdone itself this year things have already turned byzantine and the tournament has n't even started yet the hosts aka the united states tennis association have offended the guests aka the players , particularly the male contingent by monkeying around with the seedings where they once seemed content to monkey around only with the schedule the players , especially those who do n't carry american passports , have begun to behave like guests at a dinner party who fear their hosts are out to poison them there have been accusations of prejudice , of disrespect , of cloakroom politics in which network television held trump cards featuring andre agassi s ohsoadvertiseable face there have already been two men s draws because the first one smacked of skulduggery and was done backward first the open officials made the draw , then they plugged in their seedings on threat of subversive action by the men s atp tour , it had to be fixed or unfixed , as the case appeared to be there have been promotions and demotions among the 16 seeded men that flew in the face of the rankings the players had labored to build over the past 52 weeks there has been one defection , by the french open champion , yevgeny kafelnikov , whose nose was put so far out of joint by the open s decision to drop him three spots to the no 7 seeding that he flew home to russia kafelnikov s decision to snub the open in retaliation for its snub of him has cost the player what small chance he had of becoming no 1 this year it cost the open , which already lost the australian open , champion boris becker , to injury , the presence of yet another 1996 grand slam champion with the talent to be a genuine contender for the title there remains the hint of insurrection from those members of the tennis assembly line who have n't been treated like vip s , a list that now includes everyone except agassi and michael chang yesterday , the atp tour held a news conference to make it clear the bulk of its membership is playing the open under protest the women were n't included in the controversy , but lindsay davenport was aghast to learn the usta had tried to do for her what it did for agassi manipulate a ranking of eighth in the world into a seeding of sixth by these newfangled open standards horrified by the hard feelings raised by the seeding changes on the men s side , davenport , the olympic goldmedal winner , was overcome with relief that the open s attempt to single her out for special consideration like some teacher s pet did n't reach fruition i would have died if they 'd done that to me , said davenport , who prefers to get the upper hand on the competition by fairer methods if the geniuses at the usta are correct in their predicted order of finish handicapping , the defending champions , pete sampras and steffi graf , will again win the open , the latter at the expense of monica seles and michael chang , if he responds to the usta s sleight of seeding , will finish as the runnerup so much for suspense but there are endless reasons why the fourfinalist field the usta experts predict for the grand slam s 14th and final day may not materialize in fact , there are 126 players of each sex who will be trying to make sure it does n't certainly sampras , with his tourleading 344 record on hardcourts this year , is the favorite to retain his title but sampras has been less than invulnerable at the 1996 grand slams in fact , he has won none of them and has appeared in no grand slam finals his mental health was compromised this spring by the death of his longtime coach , tim gullikson , who succumbed to brain cancer , and this summer sampras withdrew from the olympics with a leg injury still , he is unlikely to encounter much resistance from his firstround opponent , adrian voinea , a romanian who sprained his ankle in his semifinal at the hamlet cup on saturday and if sampras does reach this final , he can be comforted by his perfect 50 record in the finals he has played in this year agassi , now being castigated by his peers for his alacrity in accepting the favor the open seeding committee bestowed , may have already lost the sympathy vote he gained by winning the olympic gold medal on the other hand , he also won the open in 1994 despite being unseeded his 296 record on hardcourts this year indicates he can survive the rigors of the lower half of the draw provided he buttons the lip that earned him a default two weeks ago at indianapolis the headliner for the open s opening night , agassi faces colombia s mauricio hadad , an underdog he beat in straight sets on the hardcourts last summer but the las vegan s last two grand slam outings have been ended by underdogs doug flach ousted him in wimbledon s first round , and chris woodruff stunned him in the second round at the french open so agassi had best be wary tonight
goma , zaire , feb 14 the main commercial strip in the kibumba refugee camp , a muddy string of shops and bars along a dirt road known as rue ruhunda , was dead today , the second day of a clampdown on all commercial activity here by zairian troops groups of men sat idly on empty vegetable stands , and the shelves in the makeshift kiosks and stores were bare the street s many bars , usually brimming with people swapping stories over beer , were nearly empty the camp was sealed off at dawn on tuesday with united nations support , preventing 190 , 000 refugees in the kibumba camp from trading with surrounding communities the operation , the latest in a long string of efforts by the united nations to get the refugees to return to rwanda , has turned into a war of nerves between refugee leaders and the zairian and united nations authorities the initial guard of 250 soldiers that sealed the camp has been reduced to a few dozen men they lounge with their weapons in hastily constructed guardhouses outside the camp s main exits , keeping refugees from their jobs on nearby plantations and construction sites the paved road to goma , normally filled with refugees toting goods to market , was desolate , except for an occasional united nations water truck but most of the camp s inhabitants appeared to be shrugging off the latest attempt to persuade them to go home inside the camp , many people seemed to be settling in for a test of wills it is difficult but we will manage , said thacien rubayiza , a 35yearold medical assistant who owns a bar here we are just going to adapt this is n't going to make us go back everyone here is afraid to go back there is no peace there frustrated with the slowness of the repatriation , the zairian authorities arrested the mayor of the tent city , jean baptiste sibomana , his deputy and three other camp leaders , on charges that they had intimidated refugees from returning home by spreading lies about the tutsiled government in rwanda the men were being held on tuesday night at an undisclosed location in goma , united nations officials said the refugees here are part of an exodus of two million people who fled rwanda in july 1994 to escape the advancing army of tutsi rebels the rebels defeated the former hutuled government and took power , ending a hundred days of killing that began in april 1994 and left at least 500 , 000 people dead , most of them tutsi besides ordinary refugees , the camps house tens of thousands of militiamen , soldiers and civil servants who participated in the massacres and who have nothing to gain from returning to rwanda zairian officials have said they want to empty all 40 camps on their soil , beginning with kibumba their strategy is to squeeze the refugees economically while relief workers step up a public relations campaign aimed at persuading refugees it is safe to return zaire s defense minister , mavwa mudima , and the interior minister , gustave malumba mbangula , have been going into the camps to talk to refugees so far , the results have been disappointing , united nations officials said only 73 people boarded buses for rwanda today , below the average daily rate before the operation on tuesday about 50 people returned carrol faubert , a special envoy of the united nations high commissioner on refugees , said it was too early to tell if the strategy would work the aim , he said , was to cut out the economic incentives for the camp leaders to stay and to focus the united nations public relations efforts on one group at a time kibumba was chosen , he said , because it was close to the border and had fewer militia members than other camps near goma we are certainly at a turning point , he said after this , what else \? while refugees in the camp said they were sticking close to home because of the soldiers outside , united nations officials said the camp leaders had sent a message through the camp s well developed political machine , telling people not only that they should not return to rwanda , but also to keep a low profile and abide by the instructions from zairian soldiers for the moment people are respecting the instructions they received , said paul stromberg , a spokesman for the united nations high commissioner on refugees the question is for how long a senior united nations official , who spoke on the condition of anonymity , said the leaders are still putting the word out 'do n't go home' the word has gone around , saying , 'do n't move stay there smile' outside the camp s markets , life proceeded as it has for months children played soccer on dusty fields women tended vegetable gardens of corn , beans and cabbages that they have wedged into arable patch of land they can find on the rocky ash plain where the camp lays , between three volcanoes relief workers continued to deliver firewood , food , medicine , and water and to organize sanitation efforts but the mood was tense , especially among young men along the rue ruhunda several vowed they would never return to rwanda a few recent arrivals told of being beaten and tortured by tutsi soldiers the conventional wisdom among these younger refugees is that the new government in kigali would arrest them immediately after they crossed the border several pointed out that 66 , 000 hutu have been detained indefinitely in overcrowded jails on charges they took part in genocide none have been brought to trial if you are a hutu , you are guilty , automatically , said eric ntabarisha , 27 , summing up the feelings of many young men in the camp if you are a hutu intellectual , you are guilty you go to prison that s it photos a zairian soldier stands guard at the kibumba refugee camp neargoma , where rwandan refugees are engaged in a war of nerves with zairian authorities and united nations officials who want them to go home a hutu refugee , one of the few who volunteered to be sent home to rwanda yesterday , rested on a cane as she awaited transportation \( photographs by associated press \) map shows the location of the kibumba camp
'color systems in art and science' bertha and karl leubsdorf art gallery hunter college lexington avenue and 68th street through dec 7 this very ambitious show , ingeniously boiled down to a group of small white tables , each presenting a color theory in diagram , attempts to outline the most significant ideas about color relationships from early times to the present many thinkers have grappled with color theories chemists , historians , naturalists , philosophers , physicists and playwrights , and among the impressive names attached to the more than 70 color systems shown here are plato , aristotle , goethe and isaac newton but in trying to create an ultimate system that achieves a harmony of colors , each of the theorists has taken on an impossible task , ernst peter fischer points out in his introduction to the show s catalogue none is universally valid , because in setting up their color constructions the theorists isolate the colors from the contexts necessary for them to exist still , the game is fascinating newton , for instance , based his ideas on his own discovery that white light could be separated into many colors by a prism , then combined into white light again he created a circle that ranked colors according to their values of brightness and darkness , comprising seven colors in the sequence red , orange , yellow , green , blue , indigo and violet their perception depended on the apparatus of the human eye a hundred years later , this purely optical theory was attacked by goethe , who preferred an imaginative synthesis to a mathematical one he understood colors mainly as sensual qualities within the content of consciousness colors , to him , came within categories of powerful , gentle and radiant a predominance of yellow , yellowred and purple created a powerful effect , while blue and its neighbors came off as gentle but this is just to touch on the avalanche of facts and theories neatly parsed onto the tables here what the show lacks in visual snap , it makes up for as a mine of information bring your eyeglasses grace glueck
moths will fly too close to the flame , even if they see their colleagues catch fire lemmings will march toward the cliff , walking blithely to their destruction but there s an explanation for their folly they have teeny , tiny clumps of nerve cells for brains what excuse do investors in bankruptcy stocks have \? yes , it s that time again another bigname company is wrapping up a financial reorganization to emerge from bankruptcy , and the moths and lemmings of the market are snapping up its virtually worthless shares they hope , by purchasing them at 1 or so each , to make a mint when the company comes out of bankruptcy but they are throwing their money out the window the company this time is the morrison knudsen corporation , the engineering and construction concern based in boise , idaho while not formally in chapter 11 bankruptcy , the company has been open about its intentions its creditors have allowed the company to put together a debt reorganization plan to allow it to go into bankruptcy and come right back out that helps companies save millions in legal and advisory fees and avoids the possibility that a bankruptcy court may appoint new managers who could do something foolish , like cutting executive salaries but , as in all such reorganizations , one group ends up with next to nothing the shareholders under morrison knudsen s publicly announced reorganization plan , the existing stock would be effectively wiped out , and the equity turned over to the creditors to satisfy debts in turn , the current shareholders would receive warrants , which analysts say give each share a value of about 5 cents none of this has been hidden in repeated public statements , morrison knudsen has said the reorganization plan will substantially reduce the value of the current stock but pointblank honesty is not dissuading the moths and lemmings so , in recent days , they have been ignoring the explicit warnings and buying shares of morrison knudsen on thursday , the share price almost doubled , climbing 125 to close at 2675 a share in trading on the new york stock exchange volume reached almost 10 million shares , more than 10 times its its average in recent weeks and nearly a third of all shares outstanding by friday , investors had n't yet smartened up , with the stock closing at 250 what got the stock started was a report in forbes magazine last week that dennis r washington , a montana billionaire and owner of a heavyconstruction company , was considering buying morrison knudsen what the people diving into the stock seemed to forget was that the shareholders basically do n't really own this company anymore the creditors do anyone looking to buy out morrison knudsen has to purchase its debt , not its stock on thursday , morrison knudsen put out a press release confirming that it was in talks with investors interested in buying all or part of the company but the statement appeared to be mostly an effort to warn investors of their mistake it stated that , regardless of a purchase , morrison knudsen would proceed with its reorganization plan , and that shareholders would be left with little of value people are being really ignorant here , said leon greenblatt , portfolio manager with the scattered corporation , a chicago investment company that owns 5 million of morrison knudsen s debt even if someone wants to purchase the company , the stock is worth 5 cents , or 10 cents at best but mr greenblatt probably is n't that worried about the moths and lemmings that s because he has made tens of millions of dollars in the past by selling nearworthless shares of other bankrupt companies to investors foolish enough to buy them his company just shorts the stock , selling shares it does not own then , before scattered ever has to deliver the shares it sold , the stock is canceled , and scattered walks away with the cash that s what scattered did with the ltv corporation in 1993 when the company was about to emerge from bankruptcy and cancel its existing stock shorting the stock earned scattered almost 25 million it came back again to sell shares when wang laboratories , the computer company , was ready to come out of bankruptcy mr greenblatt declined to comment on whether scattered had a significant short position in the stock of morrison knudsen , saying that he did n't want to comment on his firm s portfolio but he added with a chuckle , we think that it s a good short in the instances when scattered and other sharp traders made millions , corporate officials and stock commentators tried to warn investors away the stock exchanges stood by and let the trading take place , knowing that the investors were blowing chunks of their money after so many warnings have gone unheeded , perhaps it s time to accept that these gullible folks will never listen to reason so instead of the federal government registering securities , maybe it should just register investors a silly idea \? sure it is but at least it would save the lemmings from themselves that is , until they found another cliff graph irrational rise \? shows morrison knudsen s stock closes sincemarch 1st \( source datastream \)
ann arbor , mich , aug 31 the plan is the same whether the fans in maize and blue are wearing tank tops and sandals or parkas and snow boots everything michigan does starts with its running game , and its ability to stop someone else s in a game that would establish the direction of its big ten season , michigan showed an ability to establish control , if not necessarily dominate , in the area where games are won and lost michigan s 208 victory over illinois , earned despite having two fieldgoal attempts blocked and putting on a sputtering rushing game throughout the first half , will create some legitimate concerns for colorado , the wolverines' opponent in two weeks clarence williams , a sophomore tailback who carried the ball just 60 times in a reserve role last season , gained 81 of his 95 rushing yards in the second half scott dreisbach , in his first game since he suffered a seasonending thumb injury nearly 11 months ago , turned a scramble into a 72yard touchdown run and completed 11 of 23 passes for 117 yards and a touchdown i saw an opportunity , dreisbach said of his run i took it i tried to do a couple of moves , and they worked for the first time and as he raced for the end zone for his secondquarter score , dreisbach responded the way the wolverines did for much of the first half he looked over his shoulder , again and again , looking for a problem at the end , for dreisbach and for his teammates , there was none the wolverines , who are ranked 12th in the associated press poll , defeated the illini here for the first time since 1990 , following a loss and a tie illinois was held to 9 rushing yards in the second half robert holcombe , the junior illinois running back who had gained 1 , 571 yards in his first two seasons , was held to 54 rushing yards today , 16 in the second half jarrett irons , a senior inside linebacker who is one of three players in michigan history to exceed 400 tackles , had 12 unassisted tackles including a sack and was part of three others irons recovered a fumble and broke up two passes one of the deflected passes came on a series early in the fourth quarter , with illinois still within 9 points after dreisbach s 10yard touchdown pass to russell shaw then , on thirdand10 , irons pressured scott weaver , who threw an incomplete pass illinois punted and michigan drove 60 yards to remy hamilton s 20yard field goal , his second of the day dreisbach missed the final nine games of last season because of the thumb injury , and his return this year was made more complicated by the loss of veteran receivers and runners the wolverines lost 70 percent of their receptions and 81 percent of their receiving yardage from last season and that does not include the absence of chris howard , a junior tailback listed as a costarter and the leading returning receiver , who did not play because of an unexplained academic reason although the wolverines' offensive linemen have started an average of more than 14 games each , michigan s rushing game went through an uncharacteristic struggle in the first half the wolverines averaged 202 rushing yards last season , but , in the first half today , the fullback and tailback positions combined for 17 it just took us a while to figure out what illinois wanted to do , williams said extra points michigan and illinois , which have played against each other for 73 consecutive years , will not meet again until 1999 because the 11member big ten rotates two conference opponents off each team s schedule remy hamilton became the ninth player in michigan history to score 200 points his 8 points gave hamilton a career total of 205 , which passed rick leach the former giant kicker ali hajisheikh , in seventh place , scored 210 the crowd of 105 , 992 was the 130th consecutive michigan home crowd of 100 , 000 or more but the capacity of michigan stadium , 102 , 501 , is no longer the largest of a stadium on a college campus neyland stadium , the home of the university of tennessee , added a second level behind its north end zone , and officials announced this week that the revised capacity is 102 , 544 , 43 more than michigan s scott dreisbach s 72yard touchdown was the thirdlongest run by a michigan quarterback steve smith ran 75 yards for a touchdown at minnesota in 1983 , and b j dickey had a 74yard run against northwestern in 1977 photo michigan s scott dreisbach , who passed for 117 yards , getting his helmet knocked off by illinois s danny clark after a 3yard gain \( associated press \)
penza , russia in the wood victorian house where the great russian avantgarde theater director vsevolod meyerhold grew up and first took to the stage , the actors' studio that bears his name is performing p g wodehouse plays and the nutcracker we are trying to revive and recreate his method , said natalya kugel , director of the meyerhold theater then she shrugged but everything we do has to have an happy ending life is so hard now we try to give people something so they come out of the theater purified and optimistic gossamer plots and cheery endings are not exactly what the brilliant , innovative meyerhold was famous for the director , who was a contemporary and creative rival of konstantin stanislavsky , developed an acting method in the 20 s based on movement , called biomechanics meyerhold became the leading light of the russian avantgarde , an inspiration to the most famous jazz age actors , directors and dancers and also to marc chagall and sergei eisenstein now , after decades of censure and neglect , his stagings are being revived in paris and new york as well as moscow and st petersburg but in his hometown of penza , about 440 miles southeast of moscow , most of the factories are idle , workers are unpaid and state funds for culture long since dried up , and there is scant interest in biomechanic movement , symbolist plays or constructivist set design this is the classic dilemma of provincial theaters they have energetic directors who are torn between their ideas and filling the house , said alma h law , an american expert on russian theater who visited the museum s archive in penza to research meyerhold s early years the irony is that earlier they were subsidized , but on a tight leash now they are free , and helpless i cannot imagine there are many sponsors in penza practically none meyerhold followers in penza are mired in the all too common battle between authenticity and survival , a weary struggle to make ends meet while keeping the reputation of their master alive arrested and then shot during stalin s repressions , meyerhold was purged from textbooks and his name banned in drama classes even after his rehabilitation in 1957 , he was all but forgotten in his own country , eclipsed by stanislavsky , who had been anointed by the authorities as the icon of soviet theater some russian actors and scholars studied the meyerhold method and legend furtively , but it was not until the last years of perestroika that his bold oeuvre was resurrected for the general public in the last few years , some of the world s greatest directors have tried to recreate meyerhold s most ambitious works , from his interpretation of gogol s inspector general to plays like the magnificent cuckold and masquerade unlike the stanislavsky method , which requires an actor to plumb his own emotions to become the character , meyerhold trained his actors to use their bodies and gestures to make their characters real under the ferocious direction of mrs kugel , the actors study the meyerhold method , but they perform it mainly among themselves the museum is the company s real tribute to meyerhold and its main focus of creativity the house , which after meyerhold s death became a soviet communal apartment for 11 families , opened in 1984 as a theater museum \( it was still too dangerous to commemorate meyerhold publicly \) only in 1994 , the 120th anniversary of his birth , was it dedicated to meyerhold alone the only other museum dedicated to preserving the director s memory is the small moscow apartment where he lived until his arrest in june 1939 a month later , his wife , the actress zinaida raikh , was stabbed 14 times , murdered by an unknown intruder real estate transactions in the former soviet union are as lurid as its history the meyerhold apartment was then confiscated by stalin s chief of the secret police , lavrenti p beria , who gave it to one of his mistresses , who lived there serenely until 1992 it is now a sparsely furnished , modest apartmentmuseum run by meyerhold s' granddaughter , mariya valentey mrs kugel , who became the curator when the penza museum opened , scrounged to find meyerhold paraphernalia , old furniture , cigarette cases , wine goblets , theater programs , photographs and old letters and put them on display in the rooms that were once meyerhold s family home the imposing furniture is sturdily , pompously bourgeois , although the house contains a few hints of fin de siecle frivolity \( the billiard room is wallpapered in green felt \) to convey what meyerhold became after he left for moscow at the age of 21 , an entire room has been turned over to his avantgarde work , with huge art nouveau posters , copies of costumes , theater programs , and miniatures of constructivist sets there is a framed notice of his execution on feb 2 , 1940 perhaps the most striking tribute to the tumult that eventually destroyed meyerhold and his circle are two pictures by the entrance one is a giant reproduction of a 1916 portrait by boris grigoriev of meyerhold dancing in white tie and tails next to it is a blownup photograph of the director in 1926 , dressed in the khaki uniform of a soviet commissar , his body language shrunken and forlorn , only his plucked eyebrows and bowshaped mouth suggesting his real calling well , he wanted to preserve the theater he loved the theater , mrs kugel said in his defense he could either join and try to save his theater , or not , and lose everything there is also a trace of resignation hidden behind mrs kugel s flamboyant manner conditions are terrible , she said we have no money government subsidies come in tiny drops we make do with onefiftieth of what we really need we have a poor audience , the middleclass intelligentsia tickets cost 1 if the works she puts on are mostly unmeyerholdian , mrs kugel rules rehearsals with the kind of charismatic tyranny that stanislavsky s legendary american follower , lee strasberg , would have approved one moment loving and cooingly maternal the next , icily dismissive or mocking her proteges seem simultaneously devoted and afraid i studied acting in moscow , olga bityutskaya , who is 36 , whispered during a break but natalya does n't like us to talk about our moscow training mrs bityutskaya , who like the others in the company also works in the museum , said she was not pining for a bigger stage , people need us here , she said who needs us in moscow \? photo natalya kugel , right , directing a rehearsal at the theatermuseum in penza , russia , that is reviving the

richmond , ky , dec 29 in recent days residents of this central kentucky community have been receiving in the mail a picturesque 1996 calendar depicting , among other things , a mistshrouded bend of route 421 at dawn , the craggy west face of indian fort mountain at high noon and a closeup of a great spangled fritillary butterfly lunching on a laurel leaf but a closer look shows this evocation of the region s natural beauty to be less food for the spirit than balm for the body sandwiched among the calming scenes of madison county is a complete guide to evacuation and survival in the event of an accident involving the perilous cache stored near here 70 , 000 missiles and thousands of artillery shells with obsolete but still deadly chemical , nerve and mustard gases since 1944 , unused weapons have been stored in concrete , earthcovered igloos that rise like hillocks with chimneys on the sprawling blue grass army depot and with the same relentlessness of the march of days and months and years , the chemicals and their explosive components have been slowly corroding their metal casings though the 61 , 000 residents have always known about the gases of madison county in a general way , the specifics of what is stored at the depot were long cloaked by cold war secrecy but with international treaties calling for the eventual destruction of the chemical and nerve agents , the department of defense in the last 10 years has been more open about what the site holds new laws now require local planning for what all insist is the unlikely event of a serious accident or explosion that could spread the deadly gases and for the last four years the kentucky division of disaster and emergency services and the madison county emergency management agency have been putting out the naturethemed calendars with the detailed but discordant disaster planning information we wanted it to be attractive , said tim jones , a spokesman for the county agency with most public education efforts people pick up the written material , then put it down and never look at it it s probably too optimistic to expect that everyone will read our calendar in detail , but the next best thing is that they will hang it on the wall by the telephone and have it if they need it but for jane futrell and many others in the county , the calendar hanging by the telephone with its pastoral scenes is more maddening than reassuring they should have just put a skull and crossbones on it , said mrs futrell , a mother of two at least that would have been more honest mrs futrell s unease about the calendar and all it represents came crashing in on her on dec 1 then emergency planners held a widely publicized midmorning test of 23 emergency sirens at the depot that would alert the area to an explosion or other accident she said that many mothers , unaware that it was a test , went speeding to schools and day care centers for their children they ignored the emergency plans in the calendar that call for them to evacuate themselves and let the county s school buses take their children to designated schools outside a 40mile radius mr jones conceded that there were other problems associated with the test , like the failure to publicize it on the campus of eastern kentucky university just down the road , resulting in some confusion but mostly widespread indifference so many frantic calls poured into his office and the office of the depot commander that minutes after sounding the beeps that signal a chemical incident , they decided to broadcast a statement repeating that it was just a test for people like mrs futrell who had never actively opposed the depot , much less thought about it , the test was a sudden intrusion of reality she talked with other mothers who confessed to her their own moments of panic when they heard the test alarms it dawned on them that the school buses that are to evacuate their children are not parked at the schools all day , but are scattered throughout the county , often parked at the homes of the drivers all i could see in my mind s eye were roads gridlocked with panicked mothers , mrs futrell said none of it seemed real and workable so we have these sirens that work and this plan written in the calendar and everything is supposed to be fine \? well it s just not true merwyn jackson , the head of the county emergency planning agency , said school buses had been equipped with twoway radios and their drivers provided with pagers by his agency in anticipation of how scattered they might be in an emergency but that information was not included in the calendar s description of evacuation plans , he said , and might have to be added in the future to allay some of the fears of mrs futrell and others we have the hardware , he said , but public education is still our big problem the 15 , 000acre blue grass army depot , which houses tons of conventional military ammunition among its stands of hackberry , sycamore and oak , has a small area fenced with razor wire at its center where a portion of the nation s outmoded nerve weapons are stored it is one of eight sites in the continental united states where nerve agents with names like sarin , vx , germany b and germany a , and infamous names like mustard gas , are stored in m55 rockets they are in liquid form and simply caustic , not deadly , unless volatilized by an explosion
it was an icy , pastel day and in the harried midmorning hours the sidewalks were clotted with workers parading into one chase manhattan plaza , a sterile tower of ponderous coolness just off broadway and hard by wall street on the ground floor of the chase banking headquarters sprawls a bustling branch that employees reverently know as the mother branch a bushybrowed man with a brisk manner who works at the mother branch looked around uneasily we approach that building with trepidation , he said it all seems like a quiz show who will win \? who will lose \? do you know the missing letters of the puzzle so you can come back to play again next week \? it was not the place he wanted it to be or had known it to be within a matter of weeks , the tower will no longer be a headquarters of anything , because the chase manhattan corporation is in the final throes of being swallowed by the chemical banking corporation the combination will be presided over from chemical s park avenue headquarters and will constitute the country s largest bank , handling 1 trillion a day and as these things go , it will also mean 12 , 000 fewer people will have jobs it has become a numbingly familiar economic drama in recent years , but the script still has shock when it comes to one s own company all of this was testing the man s faith a coworker sidled past him , a small bouncy woman with glistening cheeks she gave a cordial wave and called , talking to your headhunter \? i wish , the man said well , she said welcome to another deflating day at downsize manhattan bank like many organizations , chase is a workplace in transition , a company in which old certainties about work no longer apply the change is carrying a heavy price a huge insecurity complex has taken root in the bank s employees the deracinated workers feel forlorn , if not outright hostile they are baffled about where their loyalties should lie and where their employer s loyalty lies anxiety stalks the corridors to be sure , quite a number of workers also express optimism , an optimism sometimes a front for blinkered denial that they themselves are at risk some younger workers think an employer does not owe them much beyond a desk , an id card and a paycheck they are ready and willing to play a game with unclear rules certain irrepressibly assured individuals of all ages see something hygienic about downsizing , a boldly efficient way to cleanse sloth and make it more certain that the patient will survive so long as they remain untouched farewell , mother chase employees called it mother chase it began in 1799 as the manhattan company , not to lend dollars but to supply treated water to a new york swept by yellow fever with its spare capital , it opened a bank in 1955 , the company merged with chase national bank , the bank of the rockefeller family jobs used to be as secure as civil service posts but it has been clear for at least a decade that banks are a capsizing industry they have been buying and merging with each other , first sporadically and now in a veritable stampede , hemorrhaging jobs in the process just four years ago , chemical itself united with manufacturers hanover the stewards of these banks invoke the need for efficiencies to stave off rival banks as well as retailers , car makers and brokerage houses that offer their own credit cards and bankingtype services they speak of the speed of technological change and the importance of holding the fickle attentions of wall street rarely do they address the extent to which consolidations result from lost revenues due to inferior management burdened with sluggish performance , chase has been cutting its payroll since the mid1980 s , from a high of 47 , 480 in 1986 to the current 33 , 500 pressure on the bank intensified when michael f price , a mutual fund manager , became chase s biggest shareholder last april and admonished chase to elevate its stock price four months later , chase sold itself to chemical for 10 billion , a deal expected to be consummated by march 31 within three years , management predicts , 100 of the two banks' 480 branches will be shuttered and about 16 percent of 74 , 000 jobs will cease to exist although the new entity will bear the more illustrious chase name , chemical is clearly in command indeed , many profoundly depressed chase employees interpret the deal as a sellout by senior management , the death of the company they cherished thomas g labrecque , chase s chief executive , has already been demoted to president of the new entity , which will be led by walter v shipley , chemical s chief executive one joke going around chase question what do you call a chase worker who is downsized \? answer chemical waste 'no more santa claus' with mechanical efficiency , the woman leaned across her desk , gathered up some loan papers and arranged them she drew a deep breath and slowly let it out it s not the bank i started to work for , she said , insisting on the anonymity that most fretful employees demanded for their insights about their unraveling situations they used to call it mother chase they do n't call it that anymore everything is about insecurity , not making enough
five years before michael jordan made his acting debut opposite bugs bunny , in that exercise in synergy called space jam , a small and serious film about innercity basketball entitled heaven is a playground quietly opened it had no stars , no cartoons and no merchandising campaign rather , heaven is a playground represented the decadelong effort of a firsttime director to bring to the screen a classic book about one summer on the courts of brooklyn and heaven is a playground , antithetical in so many ways to space jam , was a film that michael jordan was supposed to have made for several years in the late 1980 s , he was contracted to play a featured role in the drama , but financial problems delayed the production then in early 1990 , with the money apparently in place , mr jordan withdrew from the project whether he did so legally remains the subject of a suit in cook county circuit court in illinois the producers of heaven have sued mr jordan , his agent david falk and the sports agency proserv , seeking 28 million in damages for breach of contract on the orders of the presiding judge , the principals in the case have refused to publicly discuss any of the events at issue regardless of how the legal matter is resolved , the story of mr jordan s two movies presents a parable of art and commerce and the choice one gifted athlete made between them put another way , heaven is a playground strove toward a complex , almost literary understanding of basketball while space jam has giddily reduced it to entertainment product heaven had its genesis in 1973 , when michael jordan was still in grade school and the most spectacular and volatile basketball star in the country was james \( fly \) williams , a product of brooklyn playing for tiny austin peay university in clarksville , tenn that fall , rick telander of sports illustrated magazine wrote a profile of williams and his adoring fans in the slum of brownsville more important , mr telander returned to the neighborhood for the entire summer of 1974 coaching a team of misfits , boarding with a selfappointed talent scout and absorbing the drama of talented and uneducated young men desperately trying to play their way out of the ghetto the resulting book , heaven is a playground , fused acute sports journalism with urbanaffairs reportage , setting its playground dreamers in a landscape ravaged by crime , drug abuse and gang violence if anything , mr telander suffered for being too prophetic published nearly 20 years before the 1994 documentary hoop dreams became a national hit by similarly chronicling the fleeting promise of deliverance offered by innercity basketball , heaven is a playground sold fewer than 5 , 000 copies in hardcover and has tumbled in and out of print ever since still , on the strength of its cult following , the book attracted steady interest from the film industry at various points in the late 1970 s , the rights belonged to nick grillo , who later helped produce the hunt for red october , and to george clinton , impresario of the funk band parliamentfunkadelic richard wesley , an acclaimed playwright , wrote a screenplay as a starring vehicle for richard pryor none of these efforts , however , ever went into production so in the early 1980 s mr telander began writing the film with randall fried , a partner in pickup basketball games and the winner of a student academy award for his thesis film at the university of southern california together the men created fictional equivalents to the book s major characters while preserving its grit and underlying tragedy their plot largely turned on the rise and fall of truth harrison , a mercurial college star who slips into cocaine addiction just when he is on the verge of signing a lucrative pro contract that version of the project , like all its predecessors , failed to find studio support then , in 1986 , mr fried acquired the rights to heaven , enabling him to direct the film and early the next year , he began pursuing michael jordan to play a leading role as matthew lockhart , a splendid and reclusive athlete who inexplicably had walked away from a college scholarship the michael jordan whom mr fried sought was not the global brand name of today he was a wildly talented thirdyear player on a mediocre chicago bulls team who was sidelined the previous season with a broken foot after several months of negotiations , mr jordan signed a oneyear contract paying him a 50 , 000 retainer against 350 , 000 plus a share of profits if the film was made then the basketball star enrolled in private acting lessons with bud beyer , the head of the highly regarded theater program at northwestern university the sessions lasted about three hours a day for one week in part , mr beyer plumbed what he called mr jordan s emotional availability by asking him to free associate as the professor dropped the names of streets , gymnasiums and small towns from the player s north carolina boyhood then mr beyer had mr jordan read some of matthew s scenes with another acting student in both cases , mr beyer was stunned
a decade ago , diversifying work forces may have seemed relatively simple companies set quotas for hiring minorities and women , then filled them by holding job fairs , recruiting at black colleges and adopting innercity schools they assigned the new hires to mentors , and gave them special training they offered flexible hours for working mothers for good measure , they put the old guard through prejudiceawareness workshops it would only be a matter of time , the companies reasoned , before the best and the brightest of their new employees moved up the management ranks fat chance as it turned out , hiring more women and minorities was the easy part setting up an even playing field was the real test and one that many companies have failed blacks and women still complain that they are left to languish as white male colleagues are promoted white men complain of opposite treatment this month , the furor over taped remarks by senior texaco executives disparaging blacks has refocused attention on the smoldering resentments and reignited the debate in executive suites about how best to promote equal opportunity in corporate america clearly , the remedies that were heralded a decade ago have not provided a total cure indeed , diversitytraining seminars are increasingly derided as windowdressing , and hiring and promotion quotas are under growing attack as unfair or counterproductive but if training and quotas do not work , what does \? the answer for a growing number of companies is a carrotandstick approach of leaning on management to promote minority employees up the corporate ladder att , for example , requires managers to submit written plans for increasing the representation of blacks and women in management the bankamerica corporation authorizes lowerlevel people to carry out their own ideas for promoting minorities xerox asks women and minorities to identify issues that need addressing and tells its top managers to act on them and harvard pilgrim health care makes executives' records in promoting minorities a factor in their performance reviews and bonus calculations varied as they are , these programs share some traits they focus on changing behavior , rather than on trying to create a racial harmony that may not be attainable and they set clear , measurable objectives and make managers accountable for achieving them if white guys are still favoring white guys , the numbers are where it shows up , edward n gadsden , director of diversity at texaco , acknowledged even the most aggressive companies say that their work is unfinished , and none contends that its plan is a quick route to utopia but a look at what some are doing offers a glimpse into what more of them will be trying as companies renew their diversity campaigns att corporation a rude awakening the statistics looked pretty good at att back in 1993 the share of women in its work force had increased to 38 percent from 31 percent nine years earlier , and the representation of minorities to 18 percent from 12 percent we seemed to be making tremendous progress , said emilio g egea , director of diversity programs then , in the fall , the incident happened focus , att s inhouse magazine , ran a drawing illustrating the cultures of different continents for africa , it showed a monkey the hue and cry among att s africanamerican employees was deafening att discontinued the magazine , reassigned its staff and held corporate town meetings to reassure employees that this had been a oneshot breakdown in the process , as mr egea put it but the incident prompted att , which these days is spinning off its communicationsequipment and computer divisions , to take a hard look at itself it did not like what it saw its work force was liberally sprinkled with women and minorities , but something was keeping them out of management ranks so three months later , the company announced a more aggressive strategy it pulled people from different departments into teams , each led by a senior executive and charged with seeking ways to move minority employees and women along it compared hiring and promotion patterns at each of its divisions with those of competitors , and with statistics on the race and sex of graduating college seniors it told each division head to come up with a plan for increasing the ranks of blacks and women in management and it included in its annual appraisals of managers figures on how well they had been able to attract , hold onto and promote ethnic minorities and women , as well as employees' observations on the manager s behavior toward those groups since the program began , att says , the number of women and minorities in its senior ranks has doubled , to about 12 percent each \( minority women are counted twice \) xerox corporation finding 'champions' this year , xerox s chairman , paul a allaire , sent a memo to every manager , stressing that he held each one of them accountable for promoting minorities and women into management and he has appointed some of his senior executives as champions , with the power to act on concerns expressed by xerox s women , blacks and ethnic minorities
sarajevo , bosnia and herzegovina , oct 9 every day , american diplomats overseas send thousands of cables to their bosses in washington , most of which quietly slide from inbox to archival files without making much of a ripple but a recent message from the united states embassy in sarajevo , putting on paper the doubts and pessimism over american policy in the balkans shared by many diplomats in the region , created a stir among senior officials in washington the cable , which administration officials say was a junior foreign service officer s draft transmitted by mistake , bluntly questions the pillars of washington s policy on bosnia and suggests that american soldiers may have to stay for five years if the country is not to splinter almost as soon as it arrived last month , officials scurried around in the early morning hours , seeking to retrieve from circulation every paper and electronic copy from the state department , white house and defense department and with good reason the clinton administration s military commitment to bosnia from the beginning incorporated an explicit exit strategy elections in bosnia would help forge a loosely linked nation of muslims , serbs and croats a bosnian military , armed and trained with american help , would permit withdrawal of western troops the cable , in contrast to the administration s congressional testimony , predicts that bosnia s serbs will soon try to secede from the country , followed quickly by bosnia s croats it says that bosnia might have to become a protectorate of the west shielded by an americanled military contingent stationed in the country for five years or more though such an undertaking entails massive commitments , we believe it is now one of the few options left , if the bosnia envisioned a year ago in dayton is to be preserved , said the cable , referring to the bosnian peace agreement negotiated last year in dayton , ohio the cable was made available by an american official who questions the direction of american policy toward bosnia the idea of stationing american troops in bosnia for five more years caused most people s eyebrows to stand on end , a top official in washington said the cable , a senior diplomat said , suggests a complete uturn in american policy the notion of an openended military commitment in bosnia has no advocates among president clinton s senior advisers or others in washington who earnestly hope that the fragile arrangement envisaged in the dayton peace plan will somehow hang together but on the front lines of western efforts to stabilize bosnia , some european and american officials contend that the only way to prevent the country from being partitioned by nationalist forces may be for outsiders to oversee the government until moderate political organizations gain strength the cable , sent to washington 10 days before last month s elections in bosnia , accurately predicted that bosnian serb hardliners would retain power in half of the country it asserted that such a triumph would signal the death of joint institutions in bosnia the american ambassador to bosnia , john menzies , said in an interview that the predictions in the cable were wrong no one in this embassy thinks these things will happen , he said these represent extremes rather than an authorized report to the state department , he said , the cable was merely the beginning of list of dire and unlikely possibilities , prepared by a junior political officer for discussion among the embassy staff i had not even seen it or commented on it , the ambassador said it was sent through a series of mistakes , he said somehow it went from the author s desk to the embassy s communication center such a cable should have been edited and initialed by the ambassador , his deputy and the chief of the embassy political section before being sent on to the state department although it bore none of those initials , it was dispatched to washington one of the first senior officials to read the cable in washington was at the white house when it showed up on his computer screen he said he was familiar with the pessimism it contained but was surprised that the predictions had found their way into an official communication he called the state department and was told that it was trying retrieve all of the copies that was not possible , however , because while paper copies had been distributed inside the state department , the contents of the cable were being sent electronically via computers around washington , and beyond electronic communication had taken over it used to be the only way to contact an embassy was with a telegram , said a top american diplomat not so long ago , 25 years
washington , nov 4 shards from a broken campaign no matter who wins the presidency on tuesday , no matter who gains or loses control of congress , the returns , like the conduct of candidates great and small these many months , will confirm the nation s drift to the right it is not so much that the nation is witnessing a partisan realignment \( except in the south , where the parties have almost completely switched roles \) in most elections , in most places , republicans and democrats compete on moreorless equal terms , as long as neither of the candidates is boldly liberal president clinton is the great exemplar of this continuing trend having stubbed his toe , politically speaking , on liberal causes in the first two years of his term , he has espoused selected conservative causes he gave up on homosexuals in the military and an overhaul of the healthinsurance system and took on welfare reform , more cops on the beat and fiscal restraint on the way to reelection , he made himself , or rather his political image , so thoroughly middleoftheroad that he went into election day with a chance to carry conservative states like indiana , florida and arizona , which have not voted for a democrat for president since 1964 , 1976 and 1948 , respectively in a partisan inversion that was no accident , mr clinton cast himself as ronald reagan , peddling the politics of good humor in debates and on the stump , he has asked , like president reagan in 1984 , whether voters considered themselves better off than four years ago and on the final weekend of the campaign , he brazenly borrowed the reagan slogan , it s morning in america that left bob dole to play harry s truman , who is a tough act to follow mr dole s campaign had none of the fire or coherence of truman s stormfrombehind 1948 effort , for all the skills mr dole had honed in his senate years and all the doggedness he displayed in his 96hour campaigning marathon at the end of the struggle the political combat of this campaign has been waged not so much between liberals and conservatives , left and right , as between center and right republican candidates for the house and senate , especially those under the tutelage of arthur finkelstein , labored to pin the liberal label on their opponents democrats sought to identify themselves as moderates bent on preserving the republic from the threat of extremists few used conservative as a dirty word why \? it is all there in the polls one new york times cbs news poll , taken in the heat of battle this fall , showed that 16 percent of americans considered themselves liberals , 44 percent considered themselves moderates , 34 percent considered themselves conservatives , and 6 percent did not know should the government do more about national problems \? yes , 27 percent said , but 62 percent said it had already tried to do too much in the race for control of the senate , the signals were visible early , particularly in the south , where no fewer than four democratic incumbents , having tested the waters , decided not to seek reelection all four howell heflin of alabama , david pryor of arkansas , sam nunn of georgia and j bennett johnston of louisiana said they were retiring for varying personal reasons but politics had a lot to do with it , too their region , shifting rightward since the eisenhower era , is shifting still , and democrats have had difficult fights in trying to retain those four southern democratic seats in the house contests , the democrats' favorite trick was to try to transform races between their candidate and the local opponent \( especially if that opponent was a house freshman \) into a race between their nominee and newt gingrich , the speaker of the house they chose mr gingrich because he perfectly symbolizes conservatism run off the tracks in so many voters' eyes or to put it another way , he makes it easy to run against extremism rather than conservatism vote for x , the democrats said , and you are voting for another term for newt gingrich , the man who wants to cut medicare and school lunches mr gingrich , the hero of the 1994 republican sweep , who proclaimed a revolution and then saw the country traumatized by the extremism of those who blew up the federal office building in oklahoma city , has in two short years been thoroughly demonized but that is not to say that conservatism has been demonized if the republicans hang on to the house , said representative john a boehner of ohio , one of the republican leaders there , they will continue to press for conservative goals , but not so many at one time and not so abrasively if the democrats take it over , said representative sander m levin , a liberal democrat from michigan , they will be a much less ideological group , much more prone to compromise and much more moderate the playing field was reshaped by ronald reagan , said peter hart , a prominent pollster who works primarily for democrats this campaign has not changed that very much at all the republicans may lose control of the house it will be a few votes one way or the other but 1994 , with its swing against liberal democrats , was no anomaly the old democrats are still hurting looking at the 1992 results , mr clinton read a mandate for radical healthcare reform that was not there looking at the 1994 results , mr gingrich read a mandate for constitutional amendments and intragovernmental confrontation that was not there if either of them , or anyone else , reads this year s results as a license to maintain the status quo for social security or medicare , they will be mistaken , too what the country wants is to keep major programs from going broke but conservatives resent the attacks they have endured from the democrats , who have accused them of trying to cut spending on entitlement programs when they have actually tried only to slow the growth of spending that will inevitably make it harder for anyone , even the bipartisan commission favored by both mr dole and mr clinton , to find a way to put the programs back into good operating condition if there is no easy answer for that from the liberals in retreat , there is no magic formula at hand for the ascendant conservatives , either
twenty years later , both lou holtz and the jets are still trying to overcome the past and figure out how to read the future one thing is certain if holtz , who announced this week he will be quitting as notre dame s coach and who may be next in line for the minnesota vikings , indeed returns to the national football league , he will be a different man from the one he was in his jets days after all , when he finally resigned as jets coach on dec 9 , 1976 , after a 310 record and with one game remaining , holtz said , god did not put lou holtz on this earth to coach in the pros now , he tells friends that he longs for a second chance at bigleague coaching and that he would do it differently he understands now that in the pros you delegate authority and you do not treat players like undergraduates so , there is symmetry in the jets' facing the bills today in orchard park , ny , and in holtz s likely shift back to the pros it was 20 years ago this week that holtz s jets suffered another loss that tipped the scales for him to quit the pros and return to college coaching ranks in 1976 , the jets were in turmoil the team was still swirling from the fullscale overhaul holtz had started , the coaching staff was about to be discharged , joe namath was leaving , the front office was about to be restructured and walt michaels was on the brink of stepping up to the head coaching post today , it is a 110 jets team that faces the bills and a beleaguered rich kotite who says he is not looking beyond each sunday , turmoil still swirls around the team despite denials , there are reports that the jets are looking around for a new general manager or a new coach or even a new quarterback but if there are no rumors on a 110 team , then what is a rumor for \? holtz , of course , will never be back with the jets but his brief tenure here , which lighted up the sky like an accidental explosion in a fireworks factory , remains a fascinating legacy if his mistakes were beauts , he also had some accomplishments holtz was only 38 years old and wanted to do everything himself he tried to run michaels s defense , he slept on a cot in his office , he lined up the players by size for the national anthem , he spoke at kiwanis clubs and performed magic tricks but in the final analysis he was completely unprepared for the pro game , the pro players and new york in his one and only new york summer , he put his head back on the cot in a tacky old dormitory room at hofstra university in hempstead , li , where the jets train he had left the leafy ambiance of north carolina state and his pretty little coach s house so this , he said , looking up at the hofstra ceiling , is the big leagues like so many jets coaches who followed him , holtz attempted to clean house he did get rid of players , including some that the former jet linebacker greg buttle now describes as criminal types holtz installed some accountability but after the jets lost their first three exhibition games , he moaned in private , if i knew the nfl was this tough , i never would have taken the job and even his first exhibition victory was a melodramatic production buttle , who was then a rookie linebacker out of penn state , recalled recently i was a few feet away from joe namath on the sidelines lou was upset because richard todd , who was mopping up for joe , had fumbled two snaps near the goal line joe had already taken off his knee braces , had unstrapped his shoulder pads , and lou yells 'joe , get in there todd s going to cost us the game' namath went in without his braces as dangerous an act as a soldier going to the front without a helmet and said to the oilers fellas , i'm just going to go down on one knee let s not get anybody hurt after the victory , holtz whipped out sheets of papers and distributed them to the players i 've written a fight song , he explained we 're going to sing it after every jets victory the song , to the tune of the caissons go rolling along , started win the game , fight like men , we 're together win or lose , new york jets go rolling along the players were reluctant to sing , but namath started and the others chimed in then , a few days before the start of the 1976 season , general manager al ward plucked nine players off the waiver wires , thinking he might get a couple instead , he wound up with seven and had to take them thus , holtz had to cut seven players off his team , about onesixth of the total club , four days before the opening game holtz thought he could con and cajole pro players as he could collegians , not realizing he would have to live with nfl players more than three undergraduate years the first time todd and his new teammates went into a huddle on the practice field , holtz threw his clipboard 20 yards downfield no , no , he screamed that s not the way you break out of a huddle neatness counted when none of it worked , he realized he was better off in college , and soon the recruiting season begins in december soon , he was beating the drum for the arkansas razorbacks if he goes to minnesota now , though , he will probably wind up facing the jets , who play four national football conference central teams next season it would complete the season he did not finish with new york photo in 1976 , lou holtz gave a chalk talk to jet quarterbacks , from left , joe namath , richard todd and steve joachim the jets were 310 under holtz \( bert miller \)
our times the illustrated history of the 20th century edited by lorraine glennon illustrated 713 pp book atlanta turner publishing 65 multimedia encyclopedia of the 20th century cdrom \( windows and macintosh \) redwood city , calif vicarious 6995 how do you present a definitive history of the whole 20th century in the late 1990 s , when any broad consensus about the meaning of the past is supposed to have been so shot apart \? can you present a narrative with shape and meaning that is n't somebody s polemic \? probably , but here s another solution history as miscellany forget the single overarching narrative and its necessary point of view , and compile a lot of tiny pieces into a massive collage of history that should be a very hard thing to pull off , but the editors of our times have done surprisingly well clearly they have truly respected the challenge they set themselves the book has a masthead that includes 29 researchers , 5 picture researchers and 18 writers they have attacked the design problem of presenting a whole century in bits and pieces of text and pictures in two ways both by book and by cdrom the result is , among other things , a textbook illustration of what each medium offers that the other ca n't , and of why the cdrom is a fascinating novelty that almost always ends up reconfirming the miracle of a truly good book even when the book is more a cdromlike patchwork than a traditional narrative the book is big 713 pages it divides the century into decades , and each decade , after an introductory essay , into its 10 years , which get six to eight pages apiece onto these pages are crammed text blocks and illustrations describing perhaps a dozen main events each year \( for 1948 , for example , they include the rise of apartheid , the berlin airlift , gandhi s assassination , the introduction of the lp , the kinsey report , and the naked and the dead \) down narrow outside columns run items on the year s births and deaths , lesser american and foreign events and what was new that year \( in 1948 synthetic cortisone injections , velcro , the world health organization , the landrover and the porsche \) marginalia along the top and bottom offer quotations , sports highlights , nobel prizes , business news and more this may sound like an impossible mishmash but it is all fitted together with stunning clarity and lack of clutter , the work of a graphic design team led by the renowned duo of walter bernard and milton glaser they keep the written word paramount , and unlike so many designers today they do n't inflict liveliness at the cost of comprehensibility but rather make it their main job to convey information clearly and handsomely two other elements beyond the lucid , brisk and dependably accurate text of all the brief items distinguish the presentations of each year s events one is a pair of references at the end of each text block that direct the reader toward a previous and a later text block this is supposed to let you follow a historical thread over the years it works oddly sometimes start with roosevelt secures canal zone in 1903 , and you might hope to learn the history of the panama canal instead you are directed to the rise of roosevelt in 1904 , and from there , inexplicably , to russia loses to japan in 1905 , followed by a long train of japanese history winding up , perhaps appropriately , in 1945 , when , as if the circuits are overloaded , you are referred forward simply to that year s marginalia this might even make a parlor game guess where it leads for instance , the very first item in 1900 , freud unlocks the unconscious , sends you on to jung and then , by way of sons and lovers , into literature ulysses , the waste land , ezra pound , the sun also rises and finally another oddly appropriate dead end the autobiography of alice b toklas the other special feature in each year s chronology is a full page called a voice from that year , which allows the editors to present a historic text up to a thousand words or so long the choices are generally imaginative and absorbing a chunk of clarence darrow s summation at the leopold and loeb trial , a juicy extract from mommie dearest , the full lyrics of you 're the top , edward r murrow broadcasting from london , a piece of jimmy carter s playboy interview , o j simpson s suicide note if 95 of those might alone seem worth a book , so might the essays that introduce each decade , 2 , 000word expositions and reflections on big themes by famous writers all are interesting , and a few are especially memorable leading off in 1900 , d m thomas gives an eloquent essay on freud as an avatar of the new century that manages to convey a sense of freud s life , work and importance with a fullness and roundedness remarkable in so brief a space for 1910 witold rybczynski offers an admirable account of henry ford s moving assembly line and its vast consequences down to the present later , mary gordon presents the 1960 s as a time when the very meaning of childhood changed , and james gleick briskly sums up the information revolution but most impressive by far is the essay for the 1930 s stephen spender , in what must have been one of the last things he wrote , on totalitarianism after addressing what totalitarianism is , and its rise between the wars , he moves into a heartfelt account of his own relations with it , from his conversion to communism early in the decade to his renunciation of it , begun in spain , a few years later this makes the totalitarian impulse , the craving for absolute order in times of frightening chaos , as he calls it , real and palpable and understandable
st paul , sept 18 in their first two debates here this week , senator paul wellstone repeatedly called his republican opponent , former senator rudy boschwitz , a cheerleader for the gingrich agenda just as often , mr boschwitz called mr wellstone ultraliberal or embarrassingly liberal once you discount as electionyear hyperbole words like cheerleader and embarrassingly , the candidates' characterizations of each other were close to the mark mr boschwitz , who served two terms in the senate before mr wellstone ousted him in 1990 , does in fact favor , without significant exception , he says , the social and economic policies advocated by speaker newt gingrich mr boschwitz would substantially shrink the size of the government , relax regulations meant to protect the environment and outlaw abortions in most circumstances mr wellstone , without apologies , is possibly the most liberal democrat in the senate he was the only senator running for reelection who voted against the republican welfare bill that president clinton signed this month mr wellstone advocates governmentrun universal health insurance he voted against the north american free trade agreement , which was strongly backed by mr clinton and most other senators from both parties , on the ground that the accord did not go far enough to prevent child labor and environmental abuses by companies in mexico this campaign , perhaps more than any other contest in the country this fall , is likely to turn on issues and ideology , not on personalities or tactics or money as matters now stand , the rematch is extremely close the most recent poll , released last week by the minneapolis star tribune and wccotv , showed mr wellstone with 43 percent and mr boschwitz with 42 percent , along with 2 percent for a thirdparty candidate and the rest undecided the margin of sampling error was plus or minus four percentage points the minnesota race is one of eight senate races in the middle west this year several of them could go either way , and their outcome could be a decisive factor determining whether democrats pick up enough seats to regain control of the senate with republicans now holding a 53to47 advantage , democrats need to pick up 3 seats assuming president clinton is reelected and vice president al gore has the tiebreaking vote in addition to senator wellstone , two other incumbent senators in this region are in tight races in south dakota , senator larry pressler , a republican seeking a third term , seems to be no better than an even bet to defeat representative tim johnson , a democrat , who has been elected statewide because the state has only one congressional seat in iowa , senator tom harkin , a democrat , seems to be ahead of his republican challenger , representative jim ross lightfoot , but the race may now be close enough that mr lightfoot could pull off an upset national republican organizations plan to pour money into iowa to help mr lightfoot in the last few weeks of the campaign but mr harkin is still expected to spend double and possibly triple what mr lightfoot does , and that could make the difference the other incumbent senator running this fall in the midwest is carl levin , the michigan democrat mr levin seems to have pulled away from his republican challenger , ronna romney , a conservative radio talkshow host she is divorced from scott romney , son of former gov george romney of the four open senate seats in the region , two are now held by democrats , two by republicans democrats are expected to hold their two seats in nebraska , where senator jim exon is retiring , gov ben nelson has a commanding lead over the republican candidate , chuck hagel , a business executive in illinois , representative richard j durbin was helped when the most conservative candidate in the republican primary , state representative al salvi , won his party s nomination mr durbin , a democrat , now seems to be comfortably ahead in the race to succeed senator paul simon , who is retiring the two open republican seats are in kansas senator nancy landon kassebaum is retiring after three terms senator bob dole vacated the other seat when he quit the senate in june to concentrate on his race for president if the democrats can win either one , they will be bucking history kansas has not had a democratic senator since 1939 in the race for the kassebaum seat , sally thompson , the democratic state treasurer , is given little chance of beating representative pat roberts , the prominent republican chairman of the house agriculture committee but the race for the dole seat is tight in the republican primary , representative sam brownback broke with his party leaders and challenged and defeated senator sheila frahm , the former lieutenant governor who was appointed to the senate after mr dole resigned the democratic candidate is jill docking , a stockbroker mr brownback has been one of the most prominent of the conservative freshmen in the republican congress mrs docking handily defeated a former governor , joan finney , in the democratic primary last month mrs docking has never held public office , but her name is well known in kansas her husband , tom docking , was lieutenant governor in the 1980 s , and his father and grandfather were governors of all the interesting races in the midwest , the one in minnesota is the most compelling , not just because of the stark ideological differences between mr wellstone and mr boschwitz but also because bad blood between the two camps seems to have spilled over from the 1990 race mr wellstone , a college professor who had never run for office before and who started out hardly known around the state , upset mr boschwitz six years ago , 50 percent to 48 percent a minor party candidate won 2 percent this year , they are going at each other like two gladiators before their two debates on monday one before the minnesota chamber of commerce , the other in a radio studio there was none of the bantering and handshaking candidates usually engage in from the outset , both were on the attack mr boschwitz , who is 65 , called mr wellstone , 52 , the biggest spender in the entire senate mr boschwitz accused senator wellstone of wanting to continue a failed welfare system and give away the store to big government mr wellstone asserted that mr boschwitz favored cutting education , letting corporate polluters write the environmental laws and balancing the budget on the backs of our parents and grandparents in an interview in his office , mr boschwitz said he made a mistake in 1990 by underestimating mr wellstone we did n't take him seriously enough , he said we did n't organize soon enough we were n't ready he did not make the same mistake this time early on , the national republican senatorial committee identified mr wellstone as the most vulnerable democratic senator for more than a year , it has been running television advertisements here attacking his liberal record mr wellstone has conserved his resources and focused on building a statewide field organization that is much stronger than mr boschwitz s but like mr boschwitz , he plans to spend millions of dollars on commercials in the fall campaign in the end , said steven s smith , a political science professor at the university of minnesota , the question will be whether wellstone is too liberal even for minnesota mr boschwitz maintains that mr wellstone s vote against the welfare bill proves that the senator is indeed too liberal mr wellstone said he

a show of work by saul steinberg is an automatic hit with all segments of the public susan vogel , the director of the yale university art gallery , has verified this by having a cross section of new haven many from the yale community , but other notable citizens as well compose wall labels for most of the 50 works from the collection of sivia and jeffrey loria on view at the gallery the remarks do animate the proceedings , making the exhibition even more buoyant ms vogel goes first , writing about a swaggering soupedup taxi from 1948 she concludes her remarks with get in ! from this early watercolor onward , it is remarkable how consistent mr steinberg s style has been all the major elements the cars , the streets , the odd mix of folk , the outlandish but somehow true to life buildings were there from the first , as verified by main street from 1953 here the line may be more wispy than it became later , but the predilection for cramming in as much as possible is in evidence some of the commentators reminisce about their own new york experiences , while others engage in iconographic readings of some of the more obviously symbolladen pieces taxi from 1977 is a piling on of bulging yellow cabs pedestrians on the sidewalk are reduced to the size of mice about this drawing , nicholas pastore , the new haven chief of police , begins by saying , how refreshing for a police chief to be asked about something other than crime and punishment but he goes on to say that he dislikes the piece because he sees these taxis as tanks and they hint at institutionalized urban warfare many of the drawings reveal mr steinberg s unabashed love affair with art deco the chrysler building in particular undergoes many metamorphoses but paul bass , associate editor of the new haven advocate , writes ruefully , big towers big footprints big shoes big egos built big buildings his target is a 1979 drawing koch , chrysler and empire , featuring a variety of steinbergian characters in fancifully decorated running shoes \( but not far removed from actual shoes beginning to appear on the street that year \) mr bass continues , something was lost this time , though the grace , the humor of art deco indeed mr steinberg s once zestfully creative architecture has become in this drawing , and in many subsequent ones , almost pro forma some of the invention once lavished on architecture reappears in the elaborate costumes that end in platform shoes , worn by three new yorkers about this 1987 pastel , robert b stepto , professor of african and african american studies at yale comments , what we probably have here is just a family on parade unaware of how 'new york' they look to the rest of the country how new york looks at the rest of the country has been a theme of mr steinberg s since 1976 the bicentennial year when he drew the view of the world that john updike in his catalogue essay for this show says covers the view westward from manhattan to the drastically foreshortened rest of the world this show not only has several preliminary drawings for that muchreproduced new yorker cover , but also subsequent variations on it , including one in which the view is eastward from lexington avenue in this work the viewer goes around the world and winds up in central park in another new yorker cover , from 1992 , the american corrida a diminutive uncle sam as a matador faces a giant thanksgiving turkey the show includes four versions of this drawing richard c levin , the president of yale , wonders at the end of his commentary , would we laugh if the sizes of uncle sam and the turkey were reversed \?

to the editor your exploration \( news article , june 1 \) of the social and political sea in which theodore kaczynski , the suspected unabomber , swam during his early days as a graduate student and teacher of mathematics is interesting but it is misleading when it suggests that mr kaczynski s disturbed behavior years later was , as one person quoted in the story put it , a product of what was in the air many of us who were young during that time were transformed by it i was also a graduate mathematics student with a bright future in that field , and taught mathematics at several colleges driven by my passion for social justice and an opportunity to do something about it , i , too , left mathematics and chose a radically different course many of us swam in those turbulent waters , but very few of us ended up as hermits and virtually none of us as mad bombers theodore kaczynski was a disturbed person and perhaps the context of his life led him to act out that disturbance in particular ways but it oversimplifies and demeans the alchemy of that time to suggest that the turmoil of the 60 s somehow produced demented behavior ira glasser new york , june 4 , 1996 the writer is executive director , american civil liberties union
an vitamin c prevent colds \? protect against cancer \? reduce the risk of alzheimer s \? if so , how much should a person take , and how often \? for how long \? the great vitamin c debate has been raging ever since the vitamin first became trendy in the 1960 s now a biochemist says he has answered the question of how much c the body can absorb and retain , and he has patented the dose i review about 5 , 000 scientific and medical papers a year , said roc ordman , chairman of the biochemistry department at beloit college not a single one recommends a dose a reasonable person should take i was discussing this with a colleague and he said , 'there s no point in taking vitamin c because it comes right out in the urine' the federal agriculture department s recommended daily allowance is 60 milligrams but recent studies on antioxidants have indicated that it might be beneficial for people to take up to thousands of milligrams a day the vitamin does stay in the body at least as long as it takes to work its way through the system mr ordman theorized that to insure that there was vitamin c in the body all the time a person might simply take a specific amount at specific frequencies to keep up with the excretion process with a group of about 50 healthy adults , he monitored how fast the body loses vitamin c so we had people take the pill and measured over time the amount and rate that it came out in the urine and then selected the saturation dose that is , the amount that is kept in the body while still excreting a reasonable amount , mr ordman said though his 50 subjects were different ages , gender and size , they were healthy none were obese , elderly or suffered from disease that might affect their absorption of vitamin c with healthy adults , 500 milligrams taken twice a day is the dose that keeps everyone well saturated , mr ordman concluded he said any less than 500 milligrams twice a day and you 're not excreting significant quantities in the urine all the time , so you wo n't have a saturation level if you go above 500 milligrams you 're just making expensive urine , he added mr ordman s patent is for a vitamin c supplement of 500 milligrams taken twice a day it also covers the method of urinary extraction as a way of determining a useful dose of vitamin c , he said he said he had other patents pending that apply the same claims to other substances like calcium he is careful to point out that he ca n't say this is the perfect dose medically that would require huge clinical trials with thousands of people rather , his patent is for a dose that maintains consistent levels in the body the patent and trademark office frequently issues patents for medical and other methods but might it be hard to enforce ownership of a method like mr ordman s \? if you take a pill and put 500 milligrams in it and tell people to take it twice a day , that s an invention , mr ordman said no one was doing that before publication of my research as soon as someone puts 500 milligrams into a pill and says take it twice a day , that s a clear violation of my patent his company , the personal health corporation , will be marketing a test kit so people can monitor their vitamin c levels mr ordman received patent 5 , 558 , 870 harnessing bacteria to make enzymes though it may be unclear how vitamins protect against disease , scientists know for certain that specific carbohydrates in the body act as decoys for viruses , bacteria and funguses these carbohydrates , or chains of sugars , are found on the surface of cells and in body fluids infectious agents are fooled into latching onto the carbohydrates instead of onto healthy cells and are then carried out of the body so the more of these carbohydrates in the body , the better scientists can manufacture the carbohydrates to add to food or administer as drugs and bolster the immune system but making them has been very expensive because creating the enzymes used to string the chains together is a costly process now a pennsylvania pharmaceutical research company says it has patented a much cheaper method of producing the enzymes by using genes from bacteria enzymes what we have done is look for a bacteria that makes the same sugars people make , explained steven roth , chief executive of neose technologies inc in horsham , pa this particular patent covers five different enzymes whose actions are identical to the enzymes in people p sherrill neff , the company s president , said you used to have to purify enzymes from natural sources pig serum , cow milk , rat s liver each worked but relatively inefficiently and expensively the cost of purification was enormous with neose s patent , the genes for the enzyme are extracted from bacteria , cloned and then allowed to multiply ecoli bacteria will divide three times in a hour in a flask , mr roth explained with pig serum , you had to start with 100 , 000 liters in huge columns , with a lot of people in a very large lab now you can do all that in a gallon container neose plans to use the antiinfection carbohydrates that result from harmless enzymes extracted from the bacteria as a supplement to infant formula babies who are breastfed get similar immune system protections from their mother s milk the company is also planning drugs to fight childhood ear infections neose and rockefeller university received patent 5 , 545 , 553 silencing phones in the night you may be able to turn off the ringers on your phones all at once if andrew dibner s latest invention becomes popular mr dibner is the inventor of lifeline , a buttonactivated emergency calling device for elderly people who live alone now he has patented a system that answers a telephone before it can ring phones ring when a signal is detected during one or more cycles of electric current mr dibner s device detects a ring before the first cycle of ac current is complete , thus answering the phone and diverting the call to an answering machine , fax or modem before the bell chimes you can sleep soundly while calls can be coming in all night , mr dibner says of his patent you can awake to a pile of calls and faxes small home businesses with one line but several phones would greatly benefit mr dibner received patent 5 , 544 , 241 patents are available by number for 3 from the patent and trademark office , washington , dc 20231
san francisco , aug 25 there is a loud whapping in the background as may chang explains the marketing philosophy of her bustling food store in chinatown , whapping that mixes with a clamor of orders in cantonese and an occasional series of thumps the whapping is the sound of meat cleavers coming down on the heads of live turtles and frogs the thumps are live fish striking the butcher block before scaling the orders are for more when i was a little girl in shanghai , mrs chang says , my mother always told me , 'when it is dead , you never know how long it has been dead' i have been here 20 years , but i still sell everything live it is healthier if you offer people dead animals , they wo n't eat them none of this would be much of a problem in the marketplaces of shanghai , of course , or those of santo domingo or spain but in the city of st francis , patron of the lesser creatures , unsuspecting merchants at about a dozen chinese stores around town and the customs of many centuries have run headlong into the wellintentioned urban guerrillas of the animalrights movement it s worse than we could ever imagine , the things that are going on ! said patricia briggs , a cashier at the san francisco zoo who brought the issue of liveanimal sales in chinatown before the city s animal control and welfare commission these animals are under such tremendous stress i 've seen the shells literally cut off of turtles the fish flop out of the boxes onto the sidewalk there s absolutely no sensitivity at all ! what s an animalrespecting , multiculturally sensitive , compulsively democratic city to do \? there are those who might read from the minutes of the many official meetings devoted to this question over the last 19 months and conclude that in the eye of a bitter conflict between powerful constituencies , the authorities have decided only to dither matthew kaplan , chairman of the animal welfare and control commission of the city and county of san francisco , a consultative body of the board of supervisors , insists that this is not the case i think it s time to take a stand on this , he said i definitely think there s a problem , and it has to be addressed i just do n't know how to do that yet in the course of evaluating ms briggs s complaint that animals are being overcrowded , underfed and then inhumanely killed at chinese markets in chinatown and other parts of the city a complaint to which many of her comrades have since added their impassioned voices mr kaplan s commission did what any selfrespecting government commission charged with such a sensitive matter might do it formed a subcommittee the live animals for food consumption subcommittee , in turn , has taken testimony , examined photographs and scrutinized health codes it has searched far and wide for precedents , asking about a crusade against pet turtle sales in new york in the 1970 s and consulting with experts on the debate over laws in hialeah , fla , ruled unconstitutional by the supreme court , that had barred the ritual sacrifice of animals in the afrocuban religion , santeria and it has listened , very sympathetically , to everyone concerned so has the subcommittee come to understand , for example , that to thousands of people who live and shop in the largest chinese cultural enclave on the west coast , the logic of live food sales is simple a freshly killed fish is a fresher fish , a healthy fish likewise a turtle plucked from one of the teeming aquariums and butchered for soup , a frog skinned for its legs , and all types of fowl , which are pulled from cages at ming kee game birds on grant avenue and sold in paper bags with little air holes for slaughtering at home it s healthier , explained tsu hing , a 58yearold housewife who was picking up a redeared slider turtle at mrs chang s sf hong kong market , just down the busy oneway street from ming kee it gives people more energy the dead ones have all that blood in it that would be terrible ! the subcommittee has also been admonished , though , that such practices amount to cruelty , whatever its cultural referents this is not a racially motivated situation , insisted elliot m katz , the president of in defense of animals , a national organization headquartered just across the golden gate bridge in mill valley we are advocates for animals , whether it be with mexican bullfighting or the dog racing or cockfighting that some people say is indigenous to some latino cultures , or the factory farming that occurs across our country the merchants make the opposite point in a similar way that there is no more cruelty in their shops than there is to the slaughter of animals on a chicken farm in texas or a meatpacking plant in illinois the difference , they say , is what they do in plain sight fish live in schools they do n't complain about overcrowding , said rose pak , a consultant to the chinese chamber of commerce they 're trying to apply petstore standards to our markets it s ludicrous ! astella kung , 49 , the hardworking proprietor of ming kee , had her own doubts about the advocates' claims of even handedness she says that about a fifth of her customers are of indian , latin american or european extraction she also does business with practitioners of santeria , who , under a special city ordinance passed in 1992 , can sacrifice animals so long as they eat them afterward only the chinese , mrs kung complained , are under attack how about the homeless people \? she asked why do n't the animal people use their energy to care for those people \? they have no homes ! they are hungry ! carl friedman , the director of san francisco s department of animal care and control , confesses to being surprised by none of this

washington , sept 28 in an administration that prides itself on singing from the same songbook , there is one voice these days that keeps hitting a discordant note john m deutch , the director of central intelligence at a senate hearing last week , mr deutch listed five reasons why saddam hussein had emerged stronger from his recent confrontation with the united states , even though president clinton and his policy makers were saying that he was weaker mr deutch called it a little bit shocking that the allies had not supported american military action against the iraqi leader , even though the president and his aides insisted that allied support was substantial in a speech two weeks earlier , mr deutch said the united states stood for a change in the regime in iraq even though secretary of defense william j perry and secretary of state warren christopher said the goal was to prevent mr hussein from threatening his neighbors and at a senate hearing the same day , mr deutch said that mr hussein s recent aggression proved the need to make sure that the people of iraq get a democratic government , when transforming iraq into a democracy has never been a goal of the bush or clinton administrations in this overheated political atmosphere , where avoiding conflict with one s colleagues and shunning the spotlight are two of the cardinal rules of getting your president reelected , the spymaster s blunt speaking is clearly out of sync , or at least out of season he said what he said and he is n't backing away from it , said dennis boxx , mr deutch s spokesman he does tell it like it is but the national security adviser , anthony lake , is said to have been none too pleased about the remarks about mr hussein s increased strength , and even white house spokesman michael d mccurry acknowledged there was a little talking past each other deutch is , you know , kind of candid and analytical and brash to his supporters , the 58yearold intelligence chief is brilliant , energetic and outspoken , a bullinachina shop bureaucrat who is not afraid to air his agency s views regardless of policy and to make tough decisions in the hostile world of intelligence to his detractors , mr deutch is full of himself , shorttempered and erratic , a political animal who craves the job of secretary of defense and who deserves the nickname he was given as a chemistry professor at mit shootreadyaim in some quarters in the pentagon and state department , he is described as the unguided missile you have to take him as you find him , said senator william cohen , the maine republican and former vice chairman of the senate intelligence committee he s someone who s aggressive and takes charge i think he means well for most people in public service the goal of enhancing one s reputation is primary in mind does he want to be secretary of defense \? i assume he wants to be in his 16 months in the job , mr deutch has begun to rival ronald reagan s spy chief , william j casey , as the most powerful director of central intelligence ever mr deutch has worked hard to impose personal control over the entire intelligence community , which consists of the central intelligence agency and more than two dozen other sometimes overlapping and feuding organizations to that end , he has turned over the administration of the cia to a 41yearold deputy , nora slatkin made it a priority to tailor intelligence to the needs of the military over the civilians , and severely restricted access to sensitive intelligence information throughout the government he is unafraid to blame his colleagues when things go wrong he bluntly told the senate intelligence committee earlier this month that mr christopher should have informed congress of the decision to allow croatia to send arms from iran to the bosnians in violation of a united nations embargo he also said that the recent bombing of an apartment building housing american military personnel in saudi arabia was a military , not an intelligence , problem at times mr deutch has also taken a cutandrun approach to the job the covert program to help overthrow mr hussein is one example last fall , based on the analysis that mr hussein was weaker than he had been since the end of the gulf war in 1991 , mr deutch pushed for the restructuring of a secret operation to oust the iraqi leader , senior administration officials said but last july , after it became apparent that the operation had been penetrated by iraqi authorities , he suggested to policymakers that they abandon it , at least temporarily the officials said mr deutch argued that a pending plan to allow iraq to sell oil for food a plan that would strengthen mr hussein hampered the operation s success , as did the lack of a political initiative acceptable to the region and the failure to identify an alternative to mr hussein in a meeting of mr clinton s top national security advisers in early august , the decision was made to continue the program , the officials said since mr hussein s incursions into northern iraq , mr deutch has managed to pull out his own agents , leaving behind hundreds of iraqis active in the opposition speculation that mr perry may step down should mr clinton be reelected has ignited rumors that mr deutch is first in line for the pentagon job it is no secret that mr deutch initially turned down the intelligence position , and was rewarded for taking it by getting cabinet rank it is also no secret that he loved being deputy secretary of the pentagon before he took the cia job , and that he has suggested in informal settings that he dislikes his current job mr deutch is extremely touchy when the issue of secretary of defense comes up in a recent interview in which the subject was madeleine k albright , the united states delegate to the united nations , and her prospects to become secretary of state , mr deutch gushed about a woman he considers a close friend i think she 'd be tremendous in any position in government , he said but asked about the possible team of secretary of state albright and secretary of defense deutch , his mood darkened that s not a question i'm prepared to listen to , he said you 're out of bounds i'm going to end this conversation right now , madam mr boxx , mr deutch s spokesman , said he s so tired of hearing about it everyone has speculated about it since the day he came in the door i go over to the pentagon and people ask me if i'm over there measuring for office space mr deutch s prospects do not seem to have been tarnished by his recent public pronouncements clearly , the white house , which does not vet the testimony of the cia chief , was annoyed by his outspokenness before the senate intelligence committee last week in that testimony , he said several times that mr hussein was stronger than he had been the reasons , he said , were the failure of sanctions to oust him from power the threat he still poses to his neighbors the perceived weakening of the coalition in the face of iraqi aggression the willingness of turkey to deal more directly with mr hussein the pending oilforfood plan mr mccurry said he tracked down mr deutch for an explanation and was given assurances that he had not said the iraqi leader had gained militarily mr mccurry also played down the significance of mr deutch s other pronouncements on iraq the comment on the need to replace mr hussein \? that s a deduction from our stated policy , mr mccurry said the need to democratize iraq \? on the general theory of nirvana , in the next millenium , democracy in iraq , iran and north korea is our goal
washington , july 18 in public , government officials were careful today to refer to the fiery plunge of twa flight 800 as an accident but in private , lawenforcement officials said their investigation was by necessity premised on the worstcase scenario that the downing was caused by a bomb or maybe even a terrorist s missile the federal bureau of investigation ended the day as it began it , with dozens of intriguing theories , but many more questions than answers , and almost no concrete evidence beyond the horrific fact that the airliner had exploded in two discreet bursts , an initial detonation followed by a spectacular fireball the officials said that while they were focused on terrorism , they were deluged with other theories that could explain the explosion among those they could not rule out was a suicide bomber , a revenge attack or even an insurance scheme one of the most provocative possibilities , which authorities said they had not ruled out , was a missile strike they said that eyewitnesses had described a bright light , like a flash , moving toward the plane just before the initial explosion , and that the flash had been followed by a huge blast a chain of events consistent with a missile impact and the blast produced by an aircraft heavily laden with fuel moreover , government officials said air traffic controllers had picked up a mysterious radar blip that appeared to move rapidly toward the plane just before the explosion but the officials said they could not definitively evaluate what caused the radar signal but the officials said that other findings had made them skeptical of the missile theory for example , the 747 was flying at 13 , 700 feet , about 2 1 2 miles , higher than the altitude reached by most sophisticated shoulderfired , groundtoair missiles , which have a range of about two miles and , investigators said none of the witnesses to the explosion had seen a launch flash or heard the considerable boom of a missile shot several hundred stinger antiaircraft missiles that the central intelligence agency shipped to anticommunist rebels in afghanistan during the 1980 s are now believed to be in the hands of the guerrillas , some of whom have turned their anger toward their former patron , the united states but the stinger leaves a visible contrail , must be handled with some expertise and is generally not accurate at flight 800 s altitude today , the fbi sent agents to long island beach communities in the vicinity of the crash site in a search for additional witnesses to draw a fuller picture of the events surrounding the explosion the officials said they were also considering the possibility that the plane was downed by a bomb , either planted aboard the aircraft when the flight originated in athens , or later in new york when the flight was loaded for its trip to paris but there are daunting logistical problems in planting a bomb in athens that is meant to explode only after the aircraft leaves kennedy and circumventing security systems to plant the bomb in new york could also prove daunting to terrorists in addition , lawenforcement officials said that to create the kind of catastrophic blast that downed flight 800 would require both a very powerful bomb and one that was strategically placed on the aircraft to create maximum explosive effect by igniting the tons of aircraft fuel on board tonight , a possible lead seemed to fade when state department officials dismissed a report on abc news that a specific warning about the flight had been sent by movement of islamic change , the organization that claimed responsibility for blowing up united states military personnel in saudi arabia last november late this morning we got a copy of a letter in arabic that we then had translated , and got it to the fbi , said a state department spokesman , glyn davies it s a political tract or a statement that seems aimed at the saudi regime or the american presence in saudi arabia there is some poetic language in the letter that says bad things are going to happen at dawn dawn is their departure time is n't dawn near enough \?

the time a recent saturday afternoon the place the cross county multiplex , a 10screen theater with allweather carpeting and a videogame nook featuring tekken 2 the theater happens to be in yonkers but could just as easily be in any burb , usa the scene the timehonored quest of adolescents to buy tickets to an rrated movie , unaccompanied by a parent or guardian sometimes you get in , sometimes you do n't on this day , anxious youngsters were lined up for tickets to 12 monkeys , an rrated film in which bruce willis is glimpsed naked in a shower and later blows away a thug with a hand gun , and sudden death , which features jeanclaude van damme using a super soakertype squirt gun filled with lighter fluid to torch an enemy the fact that theaters and movie studios , in their wisdom , hav' decided that adolescents are not old enough to choose to see such scenes gave this crowd not a moment s pause i do n't think anybody our age wants to see anything rated under r , said kevin , a tall , scrawny 16yearold rafael , a babyfaced boy of 11 , added with a shrug , they show the same things on tv he and his 14yearold sister , jennifer , in braces , were part of a group of seven hoping to see 12 monkeys at the ticket window , the oldest members of the group , who were 14 and 15 and did not look a day older , requested the tickets the clerk asked the ages of the younger children jennifer , pointing to heads , said truthfully , 12 , 11 and 8 the c'erk sold them the tickets so it goes in multiplexes around the country the ratings , issued with blackandwhite clarity and olympian authority by the motion picture association of america , the trade organization of the major hollywood studios , are enforced in real life with a great deal of wiggle room ratings , which do not have the force of law , are based on a voluntary industry agreement intended to avoid government regulation of film content studios and directors regularly tangle with the motion picture association in noisy controversies over ratings given to specific films but in the malls of america , where real money is slid through ticket windows , or across the counters of video rental stores , what do the ratings mean in actual practice \? based on interviews with dozens of parents and teenagers in the new york area and with leaders of national industry trade groups , it seems clear that despite the sanctimoniousness with which ratings are proferred , they do little to prevent young people from seeing inappropriate movies , for several reasons to a teenager , an r is not so much a prohibition as a challenge it rarely stops anyone with a desire to outwit the system to many parents , the more cautionary ratings like r and pg13 play little role in discouraging them from taking young children to adulttheme films , even those with graphic violence in an era when adult entertainment is no longer confined to movie theaters but saturates the cultural landscape like the weather , young people turned away at the box office often need wait only a few months to rent the movie from a cooperative video store or catch it on cable how the system works many ratings , much indifference young people , of course , have always sneaked into the local bijou , whether to catch a glimpse of edward g robinson s blazing tommy gun or the bikinied bond girls of thunderball but the issue of access to ultraviolent or ultrasalacious fare , from movies to pop music , has become far more important in recent years implicit in discussions of ratings is the notion that society should shield children from images of deadly violence and casual sex because they are likely to breed antisocial behavior it is an assumption endorsed by a majority of americans in polls and a theme beloved by politicans from conservat 've republicans to president clinton it will undoubtedly be raised anew this campaign season , fueled by studies like one released this month by the cable television industry , which discovered , to the surprise of few , that violence saturates television the broad telecommunications law just signed by the president requires television manufacturers to include a computer vchip so parents can block objectionable programs many social scientists say there is a convincing body of evidence that repeated exposure of children to screen violence will encourage , if not cause , reallife violence but hollywood disputes this conclusion , no doubt because of the implied consequences it has no desire to see government restrictions on film content we 're not talking about newtonian laws here , said jack valenti , president of the motion picture association it s very , very murky none of the studies has been able to pinpoint a causal link between watching an action picture and becoming a murderer or a rapist the way you can track that your lungs will become blackened if you smoke cigarettes people get frustrated because of what they think are violent streets and want a quick fix you can darken every theater in america or cut the wires of every television set , and you 'll do zero to restore the moral center
warsaw , jan 24 in one of poland s most significant political moments since the fall of communism , prime minister jozef oleksy announced his resignation in a televised speech tonight , declaring he was innocent of allegations that he had spied for moscow for more than a decade hours earlier , poland s military prosecutor had said he was opening an investigation into reports that mr oleksy had passed information to foreign intelligence the prosecutor , slawomir gorzkiewicz , said his inquiry would also focus on two russian diplomats who served in poland and are acknowleged to have been senior kgb officers the departure of mr oleksy , a former senior communist official who was regarded by diplomats as a pragmatic politician during his 11month tenure , appeared inevitable in recent days as news leaks from the intelligence services and a parliamentary commission mounted he had said he would resign in the event of a formal investigation newspapers and magazines have carried reports , none of them confirmed , that the security services have wiretaps of russian agents' conversations that implicate mr oleksy and photographs of mr oleksy with the agents i resign because i am innocent , mr oleksy , 51 , said in his speech on staterun television i was never disloyal to poland i never did anything to harm my fatherland but mr oleksy , who was once head of the ideology department of the communist party s central committee and a provincial party leader , has acknowledged a friendship with one of the kgb officers the resignation of mr oleksy , the seventh prime minister in the six years since the collapse of communism , stressed once again that politically , poland is the most volatile of the former warsaw pact nations but the economy is the most dynamic in the region with 6 percent growth last year , booming exports and an unemployment rate that has been trimmed to 15 percent , poland is attracting increasing foreign investment the new president , aleksander kwasniewski , a close colleague of mr oleksy , is expected to accept the resignation immediately but because of the turmoil over the spy scandal in the coalition government , it is unclear who will replace him as prime minister the junior member of the coalition , the polish peasants party , which also has roots in the communist past , has demanded that it be permitted to name the prime minister as the price of remaining in the coalition politicians close to mr oleksy have said they would accept the speaker of parliament , jozef zych , who is a member of the peasants party at the same time , opposition parties from the solidarity movement sense an opportunity albeit one unlikely to be fulfilled to push the former communists out of power the opposition parties , loosely allied with lech walesa , who was unseated in the presidential elections in november , are courting the peasants party in an effort to get it to abandon mr oleksy s democratic left alliance and form a new coalition many in poland believe that mr walesa unleashed the allegations against mr oleksy for revenge against the former communists , whom he believes used unfair means to defeat him a few days before mr walesa was due to leave office , his interior minister , andrzej milczanowski , charged in parliament that mr olesky had contacts with a kgb agent in the 1980 s and maintained the contacts even after he became speaker in 1993 and was informed in 1994 that one of his russian contacts was a spy the allegations by mr milczanowski were embellished when the agent in question , vladimir alganov , who had been stationed in warsaw from the early 1980 s , gave a news conference in moscow this month and called mr oleksy a friend whom he wanted to protect from slander they had been neighbors in a warsaw suburb and hunting companions the scandal mushroomed after it was reported that poland s super spy , marian zacharski , who was sentenced in the united states for stealing plans for the patriot missile and was returned to poland in a mid1980 s spy swap , had unearthed the reported relationship between mr oleksy and mr alganov the allegations about mr oleksy have had many reverberations mr oleksy initially fought back by dismissing the deputy interior minister , henryk jasik , who supervised the case against him mr jasik was replaced by a political friend of mr oleksy s known for his surveillance of dissidents in the 1980 s the prime minister then installed one of his advisers , jerzy konieczny , as the new interior minister after mr kwasniewski became president such moves have further polarized polish politics the weekly magazine polityka , which has generally been sympathetic to the oleksy government , wrote today that the moral collapse of polish politics had become a fact a prominent dissident , jacek kuron , called for reconciliation he lambasted his anticommunist colleagues for using the intelligence services for their own ends , just as the communists had last week , during his first visit to nato headquarters in brussels , president kwasniewski had the tricky job of persuading alliance leaders that the scandal should not cast any doubt on poland s standing as a future nato member he told the officials that the crisis would be resolved through democratic means according to diplomats , he was persuasive photo poland s prime minister , jozef oleksy , prepared his resignation speech in warsaw yesterday after a formal espionage investigationwas announced involving charges that he had helped the kgb \( agence francepresse \)
last winter i took my sons to 42d street to survey the boardedup theaters and , from a proper distance , the last few porn storefronts i want you to remember this , i said , because when you bring your own children here , it will look completely different my estimate was more than a decade off though the end of my kids' teens is nowhere in sight , a new times square has already sprung up a huge disney store dominates 42d street the building that showcased the largest of calvin klein underwear ads prettified versions of the male and female hustlers who once loitered below is gone , making way for a new conde nast tower a virgin megastore and starbucks thrive where junkies once tranced out , and the weekend s newspaper announced that bugs would soon face off against mickey on the street once owned by damon runyon s guys and dolls warner brothers is redoing the old times tower , site of the new year s eve ball drop the miraculous redevelopment of the broadway theater district as a safe , spiffy family theme park is well on its way to completion but for those not in love with that esthetic , there is equally happy , if less prominent , news coming from what is still the neighborhood s signature industry the theater almost as a corrective to its new surroundings , the theater is suddenly revolting against gentrification and reasserting the urban edginess of its raunchier past this is hardly what anyone expected long before disney set its sights on times square , broadway had disneyfied itself starting with cats in 1982 , the street became a playland of spectacular musical themepark rides , variously starring a chandelier \( phantom of the opera \) , a helicopter \( miss saigon \) and a hydraulic lift \( sunset boulevard \) but since april , these shows have been usurped in boxoffice clout by three consecutive smash hits that are rapidly bringing the era of the british megamusical to an end rent , bring in da noise , bring in da funk and last week s arrival , the stunning reinterpretation of a littleloved 1975 bob fosse musical , chicago these nonthemepark musicals rely on highvoltage young casts , not elaborate scenery or costumes , and are relatively inexpensive to produce \( chicago cost 3 million to stage while the new andrew lloyd webber spectacular , whistle down the wind , is budgeted at 10 million , according to variety \) they are not aimed at children rent and chicago revel in the sexiness of their female performers who are featured in ads and posters that can be as racy as calvin klein s all three shows also happen to be loaded with theatrical talents destined to keep reinventing old broadway traditions in future shows like savion glover , who has advanced tap dancing from the 20 s to the 90 s in funk , and ann reinking , whose choreography for chicago is both less misogynistic and more ambitious than the fosse dances that inspired it when was the last time there were three shows on broadway you liked this much \? was the rhetorical question posed to me this week by a very chargedup william goldman mr goldman has a particularly keen perspective on broadway history he began as a playwright there in the early 60 s , wrote the definitive book prophesying broadway s imminent decline \( the season , 1969 \) and then left the theater forever to become one of hollywood s most oscarawarded screenwriters mr goldman has never looked back until now with the arrival of chicago on top of rent and funk , he believes broadway has its first chance since he worked there of attracting the audience and writers who deserted the theater with him the 18to35yearolds who drive american pop culture maybe but first broadway will have to stage new american plays that are n't musicals \( none are running now \) and do something about ticket prices \( chicago may cost a third of a lloyd webber musical to produce , but it still charges 70 for most seats \) for the moment , it s enough to celebrate theater artists who are liberating broadway s stages from themepark culture even as it erupts on the streets all around them they keep alive the dream that the new times square , like its fabled predecessor , may yet be a place where anything can happen

two or three years ago the news from the land of literary readers was all about the death of the canon this fall has witnessed a curious reverse a return to works by classic authors , driven by developments extraneous to the books jane austen s persuasion has become an object of brisk interest again in the wake of the film adaptation \( filmed without a single anachronism ! the taped phone message at my local movie house crowed \) othello and sense and sensibility are catching similarly reflected interest from their film derivatives , and television has done comparable favors for edith wharton s buccaneers somewhere , someone may even be reading the scarlet letter and wondering why the book leaves so much out but of all the books brought back by supplemental boosting , none , surely , are more unlikely than herman melville s pierre or the ambiguities the author of pierre , vastly popular in his early career , flirted with the temptations of a non or antipopular mode of writing when he came to the fullness of his ambition a year before starting mobydick , melville wrote to his fatherinlaw , so far as i am individually concerned , independent of my pocket , it is my earnest desire to write those sort of books which are said to 'fail' but pierre failed beyond melvilles wildest dreams this is arguably the least read work a major author ever wrote pierre definitively destroyed melville s popular standing in his lifetime the novel was published in 1852 to reviews that read like a thesaurus for the word awful pierre dropped into virtual nonexistence for the rest of the century , and it has proved the last and by all signs also the hardest melville novel to be rehabilitated nineteentwenties modernism created the taste for mobydick , which had also been unpopular in its own time later , the reading techniques of the new criticism and the high seriousness of postworld war ii humanism created the terms on which billy budd could be appreciated , and that work , unprinted and unread at melville s death , found an audience at last later still , the incipient postmodernism of the mid60s made it possible to understand the interest of melville s confidence man , so that this book , first published in 1856 , entered the world of readers as a contemporary of thomas pynchon s crying of lot 49 but outside of a few idiosyncratic enthusiasts and occasional graduate seminars , pierre has remained as little known as ever but in this season of revivals pierre too will get another crack at readers , assisted not by a film or miniseries but by a new edition of the book , with eyecatching features harpercollins has reissued pierre with a new text produced on a fascinating if perverse editorial theory , with astonishing illustrations by maurice sendak first a few words on the old pierre the novel was written after scarcely a pause by the author who had just finished mobydick , a second product of the same hugely energized literary urge that produced melvilles greatest book herman melville between 1848 and 1852 offers one of american literature s great figures of the driven writer , of writing as obsessional , compulsive labor while at work on pierre , melville was reported to be so engaged in a new work as frequently not to leave his room till quite dark in the evening when he for the first time during the whole day partakes of solid food in one sense a kind of aftershock to mobydick , pierre also displays melville s magnificent artistic restlessness , the ruthless selfrevisionism that leads him repeatedly to explode and reinvent the premises he works from melville had been the novelist of tropical islands , open oceans and sailing voyages but in pierre he abruptly reinvents himself as a domestic novelist , proposing to write a psychodrama of family intimacy and more particularly , to chart the emotional dependencies produced in the hyperaffectionate , inwardturning , hothouse family newly prominent in melvilles time within this new terrain melville returns to the study of the absolutist temperament he had begun in mobydick captain ahab is a figure of the psychically damaged man as visionary authority and charismatic leader ahab knows and persuades others of the one sole truth , the truth of his demented obsession pierre is another incarnation of a type that has run through american history , from the antinomian religious dissidents of the 1640 s to the civil disobeyers and antislavery radicals of melvilles generation to the sect and militia leaders of our own time in its harrowing rendition of the cult of private visionary calling , pierre envisions this urge as leading not just to violent trashing of the conventional social world but to a meltdown or disorientation of the moral world by following the compass of private intuition toward the north pole of an absolute right , pierre finds that he entirely loses the directing compass of his mind for arrived at the pole , to whose barrenness only it points , there , the needle indifferently respects all points of the compass alike

washington , may 29 trying to keep the issue of samesex marriage alive in the presidential campaign , ralph reed said today that the christian coalition would push congress to send president clinton legislation by labor day to deny federal recognition of such unions mr reed , executive director of the christian coalition , said that he was skeptical that mr clinton would actually sign the legislation , as he promised last week , and that he wanted to get the bill on mr clinton s desk essentially to force his hand moreover , he said that he believed that the act of putting the bill on mr clinton s desk would upset the president s gay supporters the organized gay lobby will go into orbit , mr reed said and lead to potentially embarrassing demonstrations against mr clinton just as the campaign was beginning mr clinton announced his support for the bill , which would deny federal recognition of marriages between people of the same sex although the bill has yet to pass either house of congress , mr clinton s aides said his announcement was meant to preempt his presumptive republican opponent , senator bob dole , from using the issue against him in the presidential campaign we have a president who says he 'll sign it , mr reed said in a meeting with reporters here today therefore , let s get it to him as quickly as possible if we can find an issue where the christian coalition and bill clinton are on the same side , i 'd be all in favor of it mr reed s remarks suggested that christian conservatives , at least , were going to resist mr clinton s effort to submerge samesex marriage as an issue mr dole , by contrast , rarely raises the issue unless asked in addition , mr reed s remarks signal a shift in strategy for him and the christian coalition , which in recent months have said they were turning their attention from issues involving homosexuality , which they viewed as divisive and often politically unproductive mr clinton s senior adviser , george stephanopoulos , said today that mr reed by mentioning both the samesex marriage bill and mr clinton s veto of a lateterm abortion bill was working at mr dole s behest to divide the electorate there is neither an epidemic of samesex marriages or lateterm abortions , mr stephanopoulos said it seems that they 're intent on creating differences even when none exist but mr reed said that mr clinton had a record of vetoing legislation he had promised to sign , including welfare reform and a tax cut he said the christian coalition saw an opportunity in this election season to win passage of a longheld legislative goal the president has pledged that he would sign this bill , mr reed said we want to challenge him to keep his promise once a bill goes to his desk , there s a bettertheneven chance that the organized gay lobby will go into orbit and create a lot of problems for the president and i think it will be a test of his leadership the christian coalition claims 17 million members , and mr reed said he would activate that network to win approval of the legislation in truth , that might not be necessary support for the bill is so overwhelming that even gay rights organizations are convinced it will pass our only chance is to make it a political embarrassment to bob dole , said david m smith , the communications director for the human rights campaign , a gay lobbying organization this is one of the most difficult issues we 've faced on capitol hill our prospects do not look good
using a witness s recollection of three letters from a license plate , detectives in queens tracked down and arrested three men yesterday who they said had stolen a truck from an auto dealership and then run down a 17yearold brooklyn woman during a flight from the police the break in the case came from a witness to part of the carjacking tuesday afternoon in astoria , the police said they described a carefully scripted scheme in which one of the suspects , calvin singh , 18 , of bedfordstuyvesant , brooklyn , and two others called the dealership , koeppel nissan on northern boulevard , and used a false name to ask to testdrive a nissan pathfinder after one of the men , accompanied by a salesman , took the truck out on the road , the two others followed in a white maxima the salesman was pulled out at a stoplight , and both cars then sped off the police fed the description of the car and the three digits the witness remembered into a computer and managed to narrow the number of possible cars to fewer than a dozen several were staked out early yesterday , one on lafayette avenue led them to allen mohammed , 23 , who they believe drove the maxima the police later arrested mr singh and derrick daniels , 24 , who they believe was driving the pathfinder when it struck rachel teitelbaum , a hasidic student and the cousin of grand rebbe moses teitelbaum , the spiritual leader of the satmar hasidic sect after surgery for internal injuries , miss teitelbaum was listed in critical but stable condition at brooklyn hospital shortly after the woman was struck , the police denied assertions of satmar sect members that a police cruiser had been chasing the pathfinder when it jumped onto a sidewalk and hit her yesterday , deputy chief lawrence f loesch , chief of the queens detectives , confirmed that a radio car had indeed been following the car at the time of the accident , but he said the officers had followed correct procedure and had not traveled at high speeds they had their lights and siren off and they were following as they were supposed to , radioing ahead with a description so that a roadblock could possibly be set up , chief loesch said the pathfinder jumped up onto the sidewalk several times in an attempt to get around heavy traffic he said that investigators believe the carjackers were aware they were being followed while the department does not have a rule forbidding highspeed chases , longstanding practice has been not to pursue such chases in residential areas , especially if their object is only a stolen car yesterday , each of the three suspects was charged with one count of firstdegree robbery and two counts of seconddegree robbery each could face a maximum sentence of 25 years if convicted chief loesch said the suspects all had long records , including some arrests for grand larceny , although he said that it appeared that none of them had tried such a carjacking scheme before the suspect believed to be the pathfinder s driver has had his license suspended several times , according to chief loesch , and at the time of the carjacking actually had no license at all but keith cox , a manager at koeppel nissan , said the salesman who took the suspect on the test drive had been presented with a driver s license before he let the man drive , although it is unclear whether the license was valid
people who are bob dole s age look at bill clinton and think , we are now being governed by the people we used to spank people who are bill clinton s age think , we are now being threatened by the people who would n't let us have the car on saturday night people who are bob dole s age think , if they could n't be trusted with the car on saturday night it s crazy letting them have the atom bomb people who are bill clinton s age think , if they could n't understand a word the rolling stones were singing , how can they possibly cope with the world of snoop doggy dogg \? people bob dole s age think , who wants to be governed by people who drink wine spritzers \? people bill clinton s age think , how can people who 've never even smoked a joint understand the modern world \? people bob dole s age think , well , we won world war ii on cigarettes and hard whisky , did n't we \? look at what drugs did for us in vietnam people bill clinton s age think , it was that world war ii crowd with its hardening brain arteries that got us into vietnam without ever telling us why who needs them back in power \? people bob dole s age and do they know about our hardship and suffering in the depression \? only what they saw in 'the grapes of wrath , ' which most of them probably have n't even seen because it s in blackandwhite and they ca n't stand movies that are n't in color people bill clinton s age this is the same crowd that used to bore us out of our skulls talking about their macaroniandcheese diet back in the bronze age who wants to listen to tales of heartbreak when ceo s and baseball players can make 5 million a year by thinking big \? people bob dole s age yuppies they 're selfish , egotistical and immoral , except for our own two and a half bill clinton s age theirs was an egotistical generation which selfishly contributed to the terrible overpopulation of our suffering planet by treating themselves to two and a half children per family bob dole s age what kind of government do you expect when you let the country be governed by people who grew up on 'ding dong school' and a talking horse named mr ed \? bill clinton s age bing crosby is dead , folks get over it dole s age some ages are heroic like ours we had franklin roosevelt , the atom bomb , marilyn monroe , henry luce , benny goodman , 'citizen kane' and edward r murrow clinton s age do n't forget jack kennedy , who said the torch had been passed to a new generation and , like bob dole , that generation , he said , had been tested in a hard war that was 36 years ago who wants to drive a 36yearold car \? the only place for it is a museum or junkyard not the white house , oldtimers dole people watch who you 're calling 'oldtimers , ' sonny boys and daughtery girls , or your mothers will wash your mouths out with soap in our generation people stopped getting old instead we stayed middleaged until we were 74 years old , and then became seniors' at 75 clinton people and raised the social security tax another notch every year so young people have to pay more and more of their income to keep unold social security collectors soaking up the florida rays and what thanks do we get for that \? none just demands for higher and higher social security taxes until your generation has used it all up and left nothing to send us to florida when our middle age sets in people who are bob dole s age what ingrates these youngsters are ! we worked hard for that money and worked to put them through college , too , so they could get those sweet yuppie jobs become investment bankers and bring home those great bonuses and to help our sons get draft deferments , too , so they would n't have to go to vietnam people who are bill clinton s age think , it s our time now , and they want to take it away from us people who are bob dole s age think , we are now being governed by the people we used to spank people bill clinton s age think , they 're repeating themselves tiresomely like parents
although most of the final national polls before last month s presidential election came fairly close to the actual vote , the polls as a group somewhat underestimated bob dole s electoral strength , leading some polling experts to give the polls a good rather than an excellent grade this year a lastminute break of previously undecided voters toward mr dole , a drop in voter turnout that left the electorate disproportionately republican , and the perennial challenge of distinguishing likely voters from unlikely voters all created potential trouble for pollsters seven national polls were interviewing into the weekend before election day their results , when averaged , showed president clinton with 49 percent support , mr dole with 37 percent and ross perot with 8 percent the remaining 6 percent of voters were undecided or favored other candidates the actual popular vote was 49 percent for mr clinton , 41 percent for mr dole , 8 percent for mr perot and 2 percent for other candidates the polls did a pretty good job , said andrew kohut , director of the pew research center for the people and the press i would give the polls a grade of b most were within the margin of sampling error but that is not as good as in 1992 we needed to do a better job of understanding how the undecideds shifted to dole at the end some polling organizations allocated undecided voters among the candidates in their final poll , each according to the organization s own formula other polls did not allocate those that did prefer to be judged by the allocated numbers , which in each case had them closer to mr dole s actual vote but for purposes of comparison among polls , the preallocation numbers are used in this article moreover , what the public saw throughout the campaign , except at the very end , were unallocated numbers in polling theory , the truth lies not in any one poll but amid the preponderance of polls usually polls tend to bracket or straddle the results some a bit high , some a bit low , with some right on the mark in 1996 , while the polls did bracket both mr clinton and mr perot , none of the seven final polls overestimated mr dole s ultimate electoral strength when a situation like that occurs , it is usually a sign of lastminute voter shifts , unusual turnout patterns or polling methods in need of some improvement the shifts at the end helped mr dole a plurality of the voters who said they had made up their minds in the final week cast ballots for mr dole , according to a poll of those leaving the voting booths , taken across the country by voter news service the shifts could have been prompted by several factors , including mr dole s final 96hour campaign push the pattern of voter turnout this year also benefited mr dole if all registered voters had turned out , mr clinton s margin of victory would have been about twice what it actually was , according to polls by several organizations turnout in 1996 fell substantially but not equally among both political parties david w moore , managing editor of the gallup poll , said in 1996 the likely voters were significantly more republican voters who turned out were disproportionately more likely to be republican in other recent presidential elections there was no difference that aspect of voter turnout reflects a major challenge to polling methods deciding who is a likely voter and who is an unlikely one the gallup organization , which polled for usa today and cnn , switched at the end from the probable voter definition it had used throughout the fall campaign to a stricter definition of likely voters , and then released the results of both methods mr moore said the stricter definition produced the more correct result 48 percent for mr clinton and 40 percent for mr dole the new york times cbs news poll , which produced the biggest underestimate of mr dole s strength \( six points under by cbs news , seven by the times \) concluded after the election that its probable electorate method , used since 1980 , was not adequate in this year s context in a postelection test , applying a tighter definition produced a more correct result humphrey taylor , chairman of louis harris associates , who also gave the final polls a grade of b , agreed that a stricter screen for likely voters was particularly important this year the more we squeezed down , the smaller the clinton lead became , he said everett c ladd , executive director of the roper center for public opinion research at the university of connecticut , was more critical in judging the polls' performance in terms of effort i would give the polls an a , professor ladd said but in terms of the use of the results , and their impact , i would grade them a b minus or c plus a large body of polling data collectively showed a landslide contest , about a 15point clinton lead , on average , across the autumn the electorate was told throughout the campaign that it was over clinton voters may have been made complacent , or the dole campaign demoralized to that , mr taylor of harris responded final polls often have a much tighter screen for likely voters than early polls do so earlier polls may have overstated the democratic lead it is a legitimate point to ask when we should go to a very tight voter screen a new poll on the national scene in 1996 was the reuters zogby poll , sponsored by the reuters news agency although this poll used some methods that are considered unorthodox in the polling profession , it consistently showed a smaller lead for mr clinton than most other polls chart what happened final election polls close , but light on dole the seven national polls conducted weekend interviews prior to election day all came close to the actual tally for president clinton and ross perot , but underestimated the tally for bob dole to varying degrees
la jolla , calif it s strange to think of an art museum as the work of a noted architect when he did n't design its exhibition galleries , and probably stranger still to praise it as one of the high points in his recent oeuvre but how else to describe what robert venturi has just done at the museum of contemporary art , san diego \? the museum , which maintains a small exhibition space in downtown san diego but has its main quarters here , a few miles up the coast , has occupied the landmark ellen browning scripps house , a triumphant 1916 work of the great california architect irving gill , since the institution s founding in 1941 during the 1950 s and 60 s , as the museum grew , local architects oversaw the evolution of the building from a house to a public institution by adding a series of gallery and service wings none of these were distinguished , and they had the collective effect of almost obliterating any sense of the magnificent structure that was at the museum s core enter mr venturi , the senior design partner of the philadelphia firm venturi , scott brown associates , who was hired in 1986 to , as he put it , accommodate the extremely complex program of a modern museum and to make of the outside a new civic building for la jolla in other words , he was to make the museum bigger , more modern , more coherent and more respectful of its history , a set of goals that contains a builtin contradiction taking a hodgepodge and giving it some order is difficult enough giving more prominence to the house while expanding the complex all around it is tougher still the transformation took 10 years , in part because of problems with raising money , in part because mr venturi was sidetracked by much larger commissions , including the sainsbury wing at the national gallery in london but la jolla , small as it is , turns out to have been very much worth waiting for this is an exquisite project , overflowing with those qualities that make mr venturi a designer of extraordinary gifts the expanded museum is respectful of every piece of its complicated history , yet it has a strong and clear identity as a different building it is a sharp and lively presence on the street , yet it is woven into the fabric of la jolla with consummate delicacy and grace the sense of balance between old and new , between object and context , is as subtle and as sure as anyone could ask for in a sense , the program mr venturi has been given here is not so different from what i m pei was asked to do at the louvre add a grand entrance and lots of fresh public space , and do some behindthescenes fixing up , all intended to bring a series of disparate sections together into a coherent whole yet in la jolla the solution is not an abstract object intended to excite by total contrast , as mr pei s glass pyramid aims to do beside the classical pavilions of the louvre , but a series of smaller architectural additions , subtractions and alterations intended to play gently on the themes of the earlier wings of the museum building mr venturi has not directly imitated the architecture that preceded him few visitors will have trouble figuring out which sections are new but he has allowed it to set the themes and what wonderful themes they are ! to understand why mr venturi was so at home on this site overloo'ing the pacific ocean , it is necessary to speak first of irving gill , one of the great figures of early20thcentury american modernism gill , who had worked with louis sullivan in chicago , settled in san diego in 1893 and slowly built a career that by world war i had yielded a remarkable group of concrete buildings that magnificently balanced the starkness and clarity of modernism with the sumptuousness and urbane order of spanish mission architecture gill s architecture , with its arches stripped down to their clean , pure essence , seemed to combine comfort with technology and modern life with a respect for traditional urbanity ellen scripps howard was one of gill s great patrons , and she commissioned him not only to design her opn house in the center of la jolla but numerous other buildings including the san diego woman s club and the la jolla recreation center and playground , both across the street from the scripps house together , the gill buildings and the episcopal church of st jamesbythesea constitute a remarkable grouping an agglomeration of architecture made up of different civic and private functions coming together to create a public presence that is larger than any of them could have achieved alone the group feels almost italian in the way its delicate scale and repetitive architectural motifs join comfortably , and if this collection of buildings is organized around automobilefilled streets rather than a piazza , well , this is southern california , not italy but rarely in southern california is there any cluster of buildings so serenely civilized mr venturi has cleaned up the front of the scripps house , revealing it again as the centerpiece of the composition of the museum then he added one large wing to the left , containing an expansive entry court , museum shop and lobby , and a smaller wing to the right , containing a cafe each uses gill s trademark arches , but on a larger scale sleek windows and walls of glass poke out from the sides , as if to underscore that these wings are not truly gill s the venturi wings also have a slight curve to them , reflecting the bend of prospect street along the building s front , which both distinguishes them further from gill s rectilinear shapes and weaves them even more effectively into the cityscape if there is any problem with the museum s facade as it now stands , it is in the way visitors enter the door to the scripps house remains front and center , exerting a strong magnetic pull yet it is not the front door to the museum visitors must enter an outdoor courtyard and make an illogical turn to the left to arrive at the front door that mr venturi has created the contradiction is hard to get away from the scripps house has pride of place , but its wonderful arched doorway is but an artifact mr venturi was unable to resolve the c'nflict between the requirement that the great old house have visual preeminence and the need for the new wing to serve as the museum s real front door so be it more important is the way this graceful composition adds to the museum s public presence on the streets of la jolla only robert venturi could have got it so right , i suspect the building is a riff on all the complex and subtle rhythms of the streetscape , rhythms not only of architecture but also of time there is no wish here to blend in so fully that the building seems always to have been there , as with robert a m stern s pleasant and exceedingly wellmannered group of shops at the other end of prospect street in la jolla s commercial center mr venturi wanted the building to be of this moment , which he sees as asserting its meaning by reaching across time to embrace other periods , and taking them all into its grasp he struggles to tease out of a highly complex context a kind of serenity that does not deny complexity thus the shapes of the building are complicated and uneven thus there are accents of neon signs in the windows thus the starburst of glass and metal over the new main hall , a jazzy element that replaces a dome originally proposed and thus the selfconsciously modern fenestration peeking out from behind the arched stucco walls irving gill is prime venturi material his architecture is simple , almost dumb at first glance , and wonderfully rich and deep the more you probe into it responding to a gill masterwork that has had years of awkward additions and subtractions , all within a busy urban context , is an architectural problem tailor made for robert venturi and the result is a good demonstration of what mr venturi , often misunderstood as more of a theorist than a designer , has always been trying to make his architecture do photo the museum of contemporary art was once an heiress s home \( timothy hursley \)
don nelson has had a chance to explore the resources of his 12man roster the past 41 games , and he has decided that the cupboard is not as stocked as he would like he said last night that he will begin using an eightman rotation from now on he can only be relieved that patrick ewing is one of those players on nights when the minnesota timberwolves are threatening late in the fourth quarter , it does not take a genius to realize that ewing wants should have the ball continuing his brilliant play over the past 10 days , the allstar center scored 8 of the knicks' last 11 points last night at madison square garden and led his team to a 10495 victory playing with 5 fouls the final 6 minutes and 21 seconds , ewing went on a 60 run by himself in the final minutes after minnesota s sam mitchell converted a jump shot from the free throw line with 4 22 remaining to bring the timberwolves within 9391 , ewing went on a tear , hitting long jumpers from all over he finished with 28 points on 12of21 shooting and added 10 rebounds and a key block on mitchell with 1 49 left one of his 5 blocks in the game well , i keep saying that i hope we do n't need patrick to score 37 or 40 points every night to win , nelson said i also hope we do n't need him to make long jump shots like he did tonight at the 24second buzzer to bail us out time and time again i went to , basically , an eightman rotation , and i'm trying to get back on the winning track with that and be a bit more conservative with our substitutions , and see if that ca n't help us win going with my best players on the floor most of the time ewing and the regular starting five are in , with charles smith and charlie ward both of whom made key contributions last night and hubert davis doug christie , who played just a minute last night , is on the bubble gary grant , monty williams and herb williams are out , for now nelson s reasoning contradicts his earlyseason plans to conserve the minutes of ewing , derek harper \( 16 points , 4 assists \) and charles oakley \( 19 points , 10 rebounds \) nelson said he wants a fresh oakley for the playoffs the knicks came out strong in the first half , leading by 5548 and holding minnesota to 385 percent shooting but the third quarter went back and forth , the ball movement suddenly slowed and those touch passes were disappearing from new york s offense in the fourth , sean rooks completed a 102 minnesota run with a dunk at the 9 17 mark to tie the score at 8484 ewing again provided the knicks with one of their biggest baskets his jumper from just inside the 3point line with no time on the shot clock and christian laettner in his face , gave the knicks a 9791 lead with 2 16 remaining davis had 13 points , including a crucial 3pointer from the left wing with 1 30 remaining that put the game away ward added 5 assists , 2 steals and 5 points in 21 minutes his 25foot 3pointer with four seconds left in the third quarter put the knicks ahead by 8 points smith also had a hand in the knicks' success , scoring 15 on 7of11 shooting , blocking 4 shots and pulling down 5 rebounds in 20 minutes they were both active and made few mistakes mitchell led minnesota \( 1129 \) with 20 points tom gugliotta added 19 points , laettner had 17 points and 8 rebounds and isaiah rider added 14 points the knicks were not sure what nelson s new logic meant after the game , but harper , for one , looked at it as revisionist history he added that it might help the moods of some players , who are not used to being pulled from the game quickly if that s his way of doing it , that s his way of doing it , harper said personally , i feel i can play all the time but i feel we have the players to give us the break we need , too rebounds john starks s woes from the field continued relegated to less than 10 shots per game on many nights , he shot 1 for 8 last night sign of the times at the garden hubert is the man on one side of the placard , in praise of hubert davis on the back \? john starks , followed by a derogatory remark that fans used for pat riley when he returned dec 19 riley and the miami heat make their second appearance at the garden on monday night some impact players the knicks have talked about acquiring the past six months jim jackson , charles barkley and alonzo mourning impact players they have acquired none impact players the knicks will acquire this season most likely , none with trade rumors swirling around the knicks since they began their slide during the holidays , madison square garden s president , dave checketts , attended the team s practice on friday at sunypurchase and as he did in the off season , before the home opener and over the holidays put an end to speculation that the club is trying to make a blockbuster deal before the feb 22 trading deadline photo patrick ewing going up for a shot against christian laettnerlast night \( michelle v agins the new york times \)
if you plan to leave long island this summer and visit foreign places with no strip malls , your time is running out many of the best vacation deals are already gone , snapped up in the cold days of january , and the travel agents are beginning to promote special offers the wise traveler knows that a special offer in june means the creative scheduling of the cheapest flights to the only two resorts on the planet that have any hotel rooms left special offer means a 5 am flight from la guardia to boston , to connect with a long flight to rome for a sixhour layover in the middle of the night when everything is closed , and a final flight on a small plane powered by rubber bands to take you to sicily 36 hours after having left home , too late for lunch and just in time to go to bed before dinner when you regain consciousness three days later you find yourself in a halfbuilt hotel between mafia headquarters and a cement factory everybody has vacation horror stories like this it is amazing that we keep on trying but there are two phases of the vacation experience , the fantasy phase and the reality phase it is the fantasy that gets us moving , when we look through those racks of brightly colored brochures the world is packaged up and sold by the travel industry as seductively as any other consumer product each tourist destination has a symbol , which appears on the front of the brochure egypt has pyramids africa has lions the far east is represented by ancient temples britain has big ben and the changing of the guard , and pictures of ireland are all in brilliant green , although the meteorological reason for this is never mentioned of course none of these places bears the slightest resemblance to the pictures in the brochures you could spend a year in egypt without ever seeing a pyramid , a lifetime in africa without seeing a lion and all eternity in britain without ever seeing the changing of the guard but it does not matter we are thinking about escape , and we go ahead and make the reservation the reality phase of our vacation begins when the tickets have been bought and paid for , and we move into the period of intense activity and anxiety called travel preparations life is reduced to a series of lists , clothes documents medicines things that have to be fixed around the house precautions against fire , flood , burglary and other disasters , and instructions for the house sitter , cat sitter , goldfish sitter , lawncare professional and so on at this stage the pleasure of the future vacation still seems worth the pain we look forward to the wonderful prospect of letting the telephone ring unanswered , to letting the mail pile up , to the united parcel service messenger who has to return packages we never wanted in the first place and to not being on the long island expressway nostradamus predicts hurricanes and tornadoes this summer we hope to be away for them at last everything is packed , arranged , listed and double checked the moment of departure arrives , and we must actually travel we are fortunate to have two major airports on long island , but unless you want to take out a second mortgage to pay for airport parking , you have to rent a limousine to go to them the word limousine seems to have suffered some damage over time , like most of the vehicles so described what usually arrives is not a sleek stretched cadillac with a bar and television set in the back , but an ancient van rejected from the demolition derby in 1976 the shock absorbers have been removed and replaced with specially designed airportlimousine shock enhancers after zigzagging nauseously through the back streets of huntington , amityville , hempstead and floral park to pick up additional passengers , we are finally dropped at the wrong airport and take the familiar shuttle from kennedy to la guardia or back again sometimes i think it might be easier to take the ferry from port jefferson to bridgeport and then drive to o'hare airport in chicago for a quick getaway once we are at the right airport , the worst part of the trip is over inside the terminal we shuffle our bags along the checkin line for an hour or two , put them on the conveyor belt to nowhere and settle down to study the information monitors that hang everywhere the information is not encouraging planes delayed , planes diverted , planes hijacked by lunatics or stranded by weather or marooned by the bankruptcy of the airline in a remote part of the globe but finally our flight is called , and we go down the tunnel into the womb of the aircraft , a kind of reverse birth that promises rebirth in another time and place ins the plane there is a different chaos people are fighting to go to their seats as if the plane is about to take off some time soon , which it is not they are cramming the overhead compartments with twice as much stuff as they can possibly hold and collecting pillows and blankets , as if they expect a long siege in antarctica at last our plane pushes away from the ramp and joins the long line waiting for takeoff we can see the other planes through the window , flashing and jostling like a flock of geese with clipped wings eventually we get to the front of the line , and it s up up and away we can relax the plane turns east in a long , smooth circle and flies down the coast of long island , with everyone peering to see their hometown and there is wading river , thousands of feet below we can almost look down on the roof of our little house the skylights ! did we close the skylights \? drawing

manila , nov 25 when bill clinton assembled asia s leaders for their first summit meeting , three years ago in seattle , he talked grandly about building a pacific community , stitching together countries with no natural alliances , few common ethnic ties , vastly different economies and centuriesold rivalries curiously , on his 12day tour of the pacific , which concludes on tuesday in thailand , mr clinton has yet to use that term his own asia hands concede that in this age of atomized foreign policies , even the common bond of booming trade and investments across borders creates something well short of a community measured by the overarching vision that mr clinton sketched out , the annual meetings he inaugurated have accomplished little but vague assurances of free and open trade over the next 25 years but by other measures less headlinegrabbing , certainly , and far short of a grand architecture for america s relationship with the most vibrant economies of the world the meetings have become enormously useful for mr clinton and in at least three significant ways , they have changed the dynamics of how america negotiates with asia and the rest of the world mr clinton pointed out the most important of those changes at a private lunch today with the 17 other leaders of the asia pacific economic cooperation group at the former american naval base at subic bay if it was n't for apec , jiang zemin and i would have barely met , he said , pointing to the chinese president in fact , sunday s 85minute meeting with mr jiang was the third one at a pacific summit , and none of the encounters would have been likely if the annual gathering did not exist dialogue , of course , is very different from progress , and certainly the meetings have done little to resolve differences between the two countries but those sessions may have also kept their uneasy relationship from jumping the rails at critical points the same might be said of mr clinton s tense meeting with president kim young sam of south korea over how to handle military provocations from the north , a subject that has caused a rift between washington and seoul in the last two months the second change wrought by the summit meetings has as much to do with europe as with america with remarkable speed , the administration has used its new relationship with asia s vibrant economies to persuade and sometimes bludgeon recalcitrant european officials into agreements that otherwise would have taken years to achieve mr clinton said as much at dinner at malacalang palace last night , corralling his opposite numbers to endorse a worldwide agreement to wipe out tariffs on computers and information technologies , an agreement that will benefit america and asia far more than europe this was the big surprise , one of mr clinton s top economic aides said the other day the europeans are terrified of being left behind in our relationship with asia technologically , economically , diplomatically and you can play on that fear to accomplish some good and finally , the summit meetings have eased , but hardly eliminated , asia s recurring suspicions about america s intentions those suspicions take many forms , from worries that the united states is no longer committed to keeping 100 , 000 troops in the region , to the oftenvoiced certainty that america is manipulating the global trading system to its own advantage , forcing countries to swallow free trade agreements before they have a chance to nurture protected infant industries , the way japan and south korea did it s taken us years to convince people , at home and in asia , that we really do see economic security and national security as a seamless whole , commerce secretary mickey kantor said here the advantage to having the president meet every year with asia s leaders more often with a few of them is that it gives you new ways to demonstrate that economic interdependence builds peace and stability the problem is that no one has yet figured out how to build a strategic vision of the world out of this merger even washington cannot quite figure out how to integrate the two ronald h brown , the commerce secretary who died in a plane crash in croatia in april , used to call the kind of work that mr clinton was engaged in this weekend commercial diplomacy , building ties by doing deals under that umbrella the administration has focused enormous attention on big emerging markets like indonesia and india , which never commanded the attention they should have in washington but before he died , mr brown conceded that he had yet to prove that more and more commercial interaction with the west would bring china , for example , around on human rights or prevention of the spread of nuclear weapons the other problem with commercial diplomacy viewed at the ground level is that it can be excruciatingly boring arms control talks were jammed with unintelligible acronyms , but at least the subject matter involved life and death mr clinton found himself compelled today to describe as a big deal an important but unexciting agreementtoagree on lowering tariffs on computers , chips and a range of other products under the administration s first term , there is little question that such accords , while unexciting , have become the building blocks of deeper relationships coming up with acceptable wording on the information technology accord , for example , forced mr clinton to deal directly with prime minister mahathir mohamad of malaysia , the most persistent critic of america s central role in the asia and pacific group it was an interesting encounter , because dr mahathir had boycotted the first summit meeting in seattle he has apparently decided since then that malaysia cannot afford to sit it out , and he called today s summit meeting a success similarly , the first sign this spring that the administration s relationship with china was slowly emerging from the deep freeze came when the two countries ended a fight over the piracy of software and videos such political gains have become the subtext of these purely economic summit meetings you can look at these narrowly and say that we are just slogging through , talking about goals for the year 2020 , said c fred bergsten , who led the eminent persons group that set the early agendas for these meetings and by that measure there is n't much to celebrate but think of how little these countries talked four years ago , and how much they are talking now

stamford , conn , oct 30 the prosecution in the alex kelly case tried today to block defense lawyers from presenting evidence to the jury that suggests the 16yearold girl who said mr kelly raped her had used drugs in the hours before the incident but the day ended without a ruling from the judge with the jury out of the courtroom for the full day , prosecutors brought in three toxicologists to challenge the scientific methods and conclusions of the defense toxicologist , fredric rieders , who asserted on tuesday that he had found evidence of marijuana and cocaine in a 10yearold dried blood sample from the woman it s probably worth less than zero because it gives you an incorrect impression , said alan wu , a toxicologist at hartford hospital and one of the prosecutors' experts the prosecution experts said the traces of drugs that dr rieders said he found were far below levels generally required by drug testing experts , including dr rieders himself , to declare a positive result they also said dr rieders used a test intended for urine rather than blood , did not follow his own laboratory s procedures and did not conduct tests to confirm what they described as preliminary results the prosecution experts also said they knew of no research to suggest the test would provide valid results on a dried sample that was 10 years old the energy expended by both sides showed that the dispute over the test results had become a central battleground of the case if mr kelly s lawyers can introduce the evidence , they can use it to , in effect , put the young woman on trial with suggestions that drug consumption combined with beer drinking led her into activities she regretted so much that she invented a story of rape for the prosecution , the issue is equally critical because evidence of possible drug use by the young woman could shift the jury s attention away from mr kelly and raise questions about his accuser s credibility if mr kelly s lawyer , thomas p puccio , is able to get dr rieders' testimony before the jury , the prosecutor , bruce p hudock , might be forced to recall the young woman so that she can address questions about the druguse allegation she was not asked any questions about drug use when she testified two weeks ago dr rieders testified on tuesday that he conducted a test known as an immunoassay on a bloodstain left by the young woman on a carpet of the car mr kelly was driving on the night of the events , feb 10 , 1986 he said that after he completed that test , none of the blood remained to subject to any confirming tests today , one of the prosecution experts , dennis j crouch , a toxicologist from the university of utah , testified that , to allow for possible errors in testing , most toxicologists set minimum levels below which they refuse to state that they have found traces of drugs mr crouch said he had studied a paper on that topic by dr rieders and the levels dr rieders found in the bloodstain on the carpet were far below those he said in his paper would be necessary to declare positive test results mr crouch said the possible traces of cocaine that dr rieders said he found were seven times less than dr rieders had declared to be the minimum , and the possible traces of marijuana were two times below the minimum dr rieders set
the devils have been working since the last day of the regular season to avoid the pitfalls of this past season so as not to repeat the travesty of failing to make the playoffs since lack of communication was the biggest obstacle that denied the team the opportunity to defend the stanley cup , that is the area the devils have made a priority one step will be taken by coach jacques lemaire , who usually spends his summers in a cottage by a lake in quebec near his home in montreal but this summer lemaire will return to new jersey around the first of july to be in closer contact with the hierarchy of the team as well as with the players during the off season jacques and i have had many meetings over a lot of things , lou lamoriello , the president and general manager , said yesterday he 'll come back the first of july and will remain here the rest of the summer that is quite a sacrifice for lemaire , who loves nothing more than living in isolation and going out on his boat instead of his favorite recreational activity , lemaire will be working with everyone around the devils to make certain things go well in training camp and to see that there is no repetition of the breakdown and malaise the organization experienced last season none of us has accepted what transpired , lamoriello said yesterday , a certain anger in the tone of his voice the last day of last season was the first day of work for this season for everyone lamoriello has been working more than the others since april 13 , the day the devils lost to the lowly ottawa senators in the last game of the regular season , a game they needed to win to keep their playoff hopes alive he has already dismissed several people , including chris nilan , the top assistant to lemaire and one of the men cited for the problems within the team the first step toward improving communication was taken earlier this month when robbie ftorek was named to replace nilan ftorek , who had been head coach of the devils' minor league team in albany , was likely to have received offers from other teams promoting him to the devils was a preemptive move to keep him in the organization ftorek s place in albany was taken by john cunniff , and he was accompanied by dennis gendron , the team s video coordinator lamoriello yesterday hired taran singleton to take gendron s place as the video coordinator the 29yearold singleton was hired from the national hockey league office , where he worked as the video director of operations for the last two years lamoriello said yesterday that he was also in the process of naming a medical trainer for the team to take the place of ted schuch , who was dismissed after eight years all questions pertaining to the status of mike peluso and stephane richer , two of the players most widely rumored to be traded , were brushed aside by lamoriello i ca n't answer any questions on speculation , he said but when pressed further , lamoriello added , i want to make sure we will not overreact , but we also have to be careful not to underreact unlike last summer , when he had to deal with so many players either playing out their option or going into the option year of their contract , lamoriello has to only deal with phil housley , who has become an unrestricted free agent
as a hong kong businessman fought for his life yesterday after being shot and robbed of nearly 1 million in diamonds outside a midtown hotel , his fellow jewelers anxiously hustled their expensive wares into the jacob k javits convention center for a trade show so exclusive it has until now been almost a secret a far cry from the gladhanding , publicitymongering style of most trade shows , the ja international jewelry show displays no signs outside , disseminates no general publicity , posts no show dates in lists of upcoming events and sends out literature in plain brown envelopes indeed , organizers of the show a meeting place for the jewelry industry s major manufacturers , wholesalers and retailers have chosen a telling slogan for it success is knowing where to show up the apparent reason for the secrecy is the concern that public notice would weaken security , though none of the press officers from the parent company , blenheim group usa , would acknowledge this many participants refused to speak to strangers yesterday some even covered the badges identifying them as part of the show , which is intended only for those in the industry a woman rushing past in a long mink coat paused to ask , if we were part of the jewelry industry , do you think we would talk to you about what happened last night \? in fact , participants complained about the publicity the show had already received the biggest mistake was broadcasting on tv that there was a big jewelry show , and that it was at the javits , said one man , referring to television news accounts of the shooting on thursday night in which the exhibition was mentioned only the people who need to know should know , said the man , who would not identify himself except to say he was from michigan the police said yesterday that they had not yet made any arrests in the shooting outside the new york hilton , although they may have added a piece or two to the puzzle they identified the victim as laokoon chow , 37 , a resident of hong kong , who remained in critical but stable condition yesterday evening at new york hospital police officials also said they had found an abandoned sedan on the west side highway that resembles descriptions of the getaway car , though they have not firmly identified it as such mr chow and a business partner were returning to their hotel about 8 30 pm on thursday after meeting with a client they stepped out of a cab onto the avenue of the americas at 53d street , one carrying a bag full of diamonds three men strode toward them , the police said armed with guns and wearing knit caps pulled down close to their eyes , the men shot mr chow in the chest , then grabbed the bag and fled at the javits center yesterday , a steady stream of armored cars , vans and taxis dropped off exhibitors bearing bulky crates , bulging briefcases and bags like the one stolen on thursday security was heavy , with police officers scrutinizing the unloading of vehicles and guards chasing away those inside without proper passes the jewelry manufacturers , wholesalers and retailers arriving at the event expressed a mix of nervousness and a resignation about the inherent dangers of their business some spoke of past crimes surrounding jewelry shows at the javits center , including the robbery that occurred last january on the brooklynqueens expressway , in which 5 million was taken from three men who had just left the show in june , about 2 million in jewelry was stolen from a security room in the javits center during a jewelry show in june 1993 , 900 , 000 worth was stolen from a javits storage room in july 1992 , the owner of a los angeles jewelry company and seven of his employees were robbed of 400 , 000 in jewels and 250 , 000 in cash as they prepared to leave their midtown hotel simple opportunity is a big part of the reason many jewelers do take precautions , like carrying guns or hiring bodyguards but , armed or not , jewelers have long transported their own goods indeed , the business is one of the few in which a person can carry millions of dollars' worth of his or her inventory around in a briefcase quite a few people carry their own lines , unfortunately , said roxanne vaks , general manager of rubin son , which sells diamond and jewelry supplies it s quite a stupid thing to do , but people do it ms vaks , who said some of her displays had been stolen at last year s show as she packed up , described new york s january show as traditionally the premier one in the industry but she suggested that fear of theft , combined with other local inconveniences , was causing the show to lose ground to the june show in las vegas people hate the cold , the snow , the theft , the huge cost of hotel rooms , she said new york has a pretty lousy reputation others said they were more concerned than ever about security you ca n't trust any stranger you speak to , said bernie fisher , who specializes in silver people get a little too trusting mr fisher , whose business is in new york , said it was common for jewelry professionals here to carry guns when transporting valuable gems joe eisenhower of atlanta said he and many others carried realistic facsimiles of their jewels to the show sylvia rodriguez of los angeles said her company , ashar inc , shipped everything directly to the center nobody ever carries anything , she said rene bargueiras , owner of a jewelry company in glendale , calif , said he hoped one result of the latest crime would be improved security in hotels where participants book blocks of rooms this might be a good wakeup call , he said officials at the hilton refused to comment yesterday a colleague from mr bargueiras s company , who identified himself only as mr gold , said we bring millions of dollars to this city we deserve better security photo armed guards delivered merchandise yesterday to the jacob kjavits convention center , site of the j a international jewelry show \( ruby washington the new york times \)
eighteen childabuseprevention agencies across new york city , including several with decadeslong track records of success , have been told by giuliani administration officials that their programs will end as of next month city officials said the decision not to continue financing the programs was the result of contract reviews , and they insisted that the scores of families served by the programs would be turned over to different agencies nicholas scoppetta , commissioner of the administration for children s services , said the city s financial commitment to preventive services had not been cut back and would not be reduced in the future agencies providing preventive services offer counseling , medical and psychiatric care and , often , drug or alcohol treatment to parents in an effort to keep families intact and not force children into an already overburdened foster care system the decisions not to give contracts to certain agencies is not meant to defund the services themselves , said mr scoppetta he said the 123 million budgeted for spending on preventive services in the coming fiscal year did not represent a significant cut mr scoppetta conceded that , despite two years having elapsed since the city first asked agencies to apply for new preventive services contracts , none had been awarded he said he hoped the new contracts would be in place by the time the contracts with the agencies losing city work end on june 30 elected officials and representatives of the affected agencies have assailed the contract process as badly flawed , and have questioned whether the city will have alternative agencies in place one affected agency is columbiapresbyterian medical center s family center in northern manhattan the center has operated for 17 years and in that time has served 1 , 500 families , providing psychiatric care and social workers to some of the city s children most at risk of neglect and abuse dr william t speck , executive director of presbyterian hospital , said in a draft of a letter sent to mr scoppetta this week that the family center was a nationally recognized program it is handling 80 families and had proposed increasing its caseload to 150 families officials with columbiapresbyterian would not speak publicly yesterday but dr speck s letter to the city portrayed the selection process as incompetent begun in 1994 , when the city first asked agencies to submit proposals , the process apparently stalled for months as personnel at the city s child welfare agency changed according to dr speck , the contracts were supposed to have been awarded in november 1994 mr scoppetta said the selection process was less than ideal but he said he was willing to live with it the city s actions have raised concerns about impacts on families steve cohen , executive director of the jewish board for family and children s services , said the joint program his agency had run for 25 years was also being ended the program handles 90 families
as goes chile , so goes the world \? while chile s gross domestic product is smaller than connecticut s , the bornagain capitalist economy has a way of inspiring imitators for along with having the fastest growth rate outside asia , chile is also the first to create a truly private social pension system and the country s virtually painless transition from a bankrupt public pension system has policy wonks around the globe panting to learn the secret but the chilean model probably will not travel as well as enthusiasts suggest at least not to the united states while chile s new social security system is working almost as well as advertised , the achievement has depended in part on circumstances that do n't apply here they had a wideopen opportunity for a fresh start and we do n't , said lawrence white of the stern school of business at new york university chile s halfcentury old defined benefit pension system collapsed under the weight of broken promises in 1981 it was the first of its kind in the world and , by no coincidence , the first of its kind to collapse , said karl borden , an economist at the university of nebraska and consultant to the libertarian cato institute chile s freemarketminded dictatorship converted the system into a mandatory private savings plan in which pensions are largely determined by individual contributions and investment choices chilean workers must set aside 10 percent of their earnings in any of 21 private but heavily regulated pension plans the two biggest , incidentally , are largely owned by bankers trust and aetna life and casualty at retirement , the money can be used to buy a private annuity that pays a fixed monthly stipend alternatively , retirees can link their pensions to the continuing performance of their investment funds retirement is 65 for men and 60 for women chileans , however , are free to head for the beach earlier if they have accumulated enough to replace half their wages with an annuity the new system includes a safety net retirees and older workers caught in the transition from the bankrupt definedbenefit system are being paid their promised pensions from government bonds that are amortized from general tax revenues moreover , the government guarantees a subsistence income to everyone who has contributed to the new system for a total of 20 years if the investment funds do not perform well enough to cover the cost one problem here is the classic issue of definedcontribution pensions individuals bear a lot of risk but olivia mitchell , a professor at the wharton school , points to the other side of this coin governments , she said , can always renege on their promises to cover defined benefits and do once their unrealistic promises are exposed a more mundane but very real concern is the cost of managing the private pensions average fees collected by chile s fund managers currently exceed 20 percent of annual contributions these numbers are way out of line with efficient pension fund management , said william alpert , an economist at the university of connecticut that said , it is hard to deny the chilean system is thriving for one thing , transition problems in particular , the need to cover underfunded definedbenefit pensions that might have been insurmountable in a democracy were solved with the stroke of a pen for another , the ratio of taxpaying workers to retirees is almost three times as high as in the united states chile has a very young population , which means that relatively large numbers of taxpayers are available to support those who reach old age in poverty , said sylvester schieber , an economist with watson wyatt pension consultants last but hardly least , the private pension funds have benefited from the explosive performance of the local stock market the returns to the pension funds' portfolios have averaged 13 percent in real terms roughly twice the rate of growth of the american stock market over the last 70 years the key element insuring the success of the system has been the profitability of the investments , julio bustamente , chile s director of pensions , acknowledged it is easy to see why the chilean pension system has become a model for peru , argentina , bolivia and mexico all have young work forces to support retirees during the transition from payasyougo finance and all have immature capital markets begging for large , stable sources of domestic savings but none of this suggests that privatization of social security is a panacea for the united states where there are too few workers to support the retirement of the baby boomers , where promises to retirees exceed expected tax revenue by several trillion dollars and where government is seemingly always on the verge of gridlock by contrast , mr borden said , all general pinochet had to do was say is 'this is the way it is , fellas' drawing

i 'll take the win , the nineyear veteran said we need that more than anything else when i got the 10 , 000th point , butch congratulated me and said it s great you got the 10 , 000 , but we need the win i felt the same way the nets \( 2329 \) nearly blew it they were up the entire second half , but baker \( 17 points , 12 rebounds \) forced overtime and the bucks \( 2031 \) actually led by as many as 3 in the extra session but chris childs and gilliam again came up huge childs , hobbling at the end of the game with a possible strained groin , buried a 3pointer from the top of the key with 1 minute 32 seconds left in overtime to erase a onepoint milwaukee lead childs then forced a steal by batting a pass off of douglas to vern fleming and gilliam buried a 12footer from the left side with 1 06 left for a 9490 lead childs and gilliam each wound up with 23 points to lead five nets in double figures baker , who with glenn \( big dog \) robinson \( 24 points \) led six bucks in double figures , closed the deficit to 2 with a 17footer with 499 seconds to go but with one last chance to tie , douglas missed gilliam , though winding up on his back , was fittingly in the right place and the nets had their first fivegame winning streak since april 1994 the nets have n't won six games in a row since nov 25dec 4 , 1992 on saturday , in cleveland , they will actually have the chance we want this steak to keep going to eight or nine games , said beard it wo n't be easy tonight s victory was n't the bucks , led by robinson and baker , had forced overtime with an 81 run in the final minute and a half of regulation , capped by baker s clutch turnaround over gilliam with 42 seconds remaining the nets went cold down the stretch with the nets up by 8680 , robinson , who was 6 for 10 in the second half , buried a 3pointer left of the basket to cut the deficit to 3 after a vern fleming free throw , cummings hit both free throws with 39 seconds to play after he had fouled shawn bradley out , and it was 8785 with a chance to put the game away , childs , who finished with 7 assists and 5 steals , watched helplessly as his jumper hit the rim twice and bounced off the bucks called timeout with 164 to play to set up baker s tying basket the nets had one last chance to win in regulation , but fleming s desperation nolook overtheshoulder lob clanked off the backboard and then the rim after childs had slipped above the top of the key and injured his groin so it was up to the nets to win it in overtime what s five extra minutes when you 're on a roll \? childs , however , had to lobby hard for beard to put him back in the game just like a hockey goalie , i did the splits , said childs and i'm not that flexible just durable i asked back in , said childs , who was removed because of the injury with 3 22 remaining in the extra session i was slipping around all night thirtysix seconds later , beard granted childs his wish and childs helped deliver the nets the victory it was a game we needed , the guard said it was important i can rest all summer i was wondering why he took me out all in all , it was a momentous night for new jersey gilliam reached the 10 , 000point plateau with 1 42 remaining in the first half after taking a feed from childs and burying an open 14footer from the right baseline the basket gave him 10 , 001 for his career and 13 for the half it also gave the nets a 3837 lead , which they would expand , barely , to 4139 at the break after three , it was 5752 new jersey and milwaukee would not lead again until overtime in the end , however , the nets were just too resilient we 've been saying we 're a good team all year , said p j brown \( 17 points , 7 rebounds \) people have n't believed us and now we 're showing it rebounds for the fifth consecutive game , shawn bradley outplayed the opposing team s center wednesday night s victim was the exnet benoit benjamin bradley , who fouled out with 39 seconds to play , had 15 points on 7for12 shooting and to go with 8 rebounds and 4 blocks benjamin had 7 points and 5 rebounds the nets were fogged in and rescheduled their flight to new jersey to thursday photo intimidation by nets' shawn bradley , left , spoiling a dunkattempt by milwaukee s glenn robinson last night \( reuters \) \( pg b13 \)

in a shocking end to one of the longest relationships between a big advertiser and its agency , united airlines yesterday dismissed the leo burnett company , the chicago shop that won the carrier s account in 1965 by suggesting that united urge travelers to fly the friendly skies the decision also means the end of one of the most familiar campaigns in ad history , which featured everything from singing wives asking their husbands to take me along on business trips to whales that appeared to swim inside a jumbo jet and a parrot that seemingly played rhapsody in blue on the piano the two agencies that were awarded the account from burnett both recommended that the friendly skies theme be replaced united , a unit of the ual corporation , turned downright unfriendly to burnett by deciding after a threemonth review to divide its account , with billings estimated at 120 million , between the other two agencies one is fallon mcelligott in minneapolis , a hot midsized shop , which recently earned a reputation as one of america s most creative agencies the other is young rubicam inc , the giant bluechip agency based in new york leaving leo burnett is a lot like leaving one of your best and oldest friends , said gerald greenwald , chairman and chief executive at united in elk grove village , ill during the past three decades , they have made invaluable contributions to our image , our business and our success but in the end , he added , we selected fallon mcelligott and young rubicam for their incredible strategic insights and creativity , clout , superlative experience and international expertise the loss is a bitter blow to burnett , which had won acclaim for creating awardwinning campaigns that helped the airline grow to become the world s largest everyone says , 'you do the best work in the category , ' said linda wolf , president of the leo burnett usa unit of burnett , who attributed the dismissal to new people coming in at united wanting to reexamine everything her reference was to the review s start two weeks after the retirement of john e ruhaak , vice president for advertising and promotion at united , who had worked for the airline 22 years and before that worked at burnett mr ruhaak s successor , michael howe , advertising and promotion director , was one of seven united executives who made the decisions to dismiss burnett burnett certainly had a chance and did very well , mr howe said but the opinion of the group of people who will be moving this airline forward was that a combination of fallon and y r could probably move the airline forward better none of the finalists in the review , including burnett , felt we should continue with the 'friendly skies , ' he added , because we do n't think it s necessarily the way we need to appeal to our customers at this point burnett s current work for united features television commercials with the voice of the actor gene hackman , who asks viewers to come fly our friendly skies a rewording after united became employeeowned as rhapsody in blue is heard on the soundtrack fallon mcelligott will be primarily responsible for united s work in north america , while y r will take a primary role in the advertising in 31 countries both will share media planning and y r will handle media buying they saw some things from us they thought could really help their business , mark goldstein , president for integrated marketing at fallon mcelligott , said , and they saw some things from y r they thought could really help their business and then they thought a combination of the two of us would be great , he added some other airlines , like northwest , a former fallon client , divide accounts the review began in late july with eight agencies and had been narrowed in august to five semifinalists it was further narrowed early this month to four finalists burnett , fallon mcelligott , y r and tbwa chiat day in new york , part of the tbwa international agency network owned by omnicom group united s dismissal of burnett was the second sudden divorce this week between a big advertiser and its longtime agency it came three days after american honda motor dismissed the fathom unit of omnicom in los angeles after 12 years and shifted the account of its acura line , with billings estimated at 125 million , to suissa miller , a small agency in santa monica , calif one commercial that burnett created in 1989 for united , which began reappearing recently , eerily foreshadowed yesterday s decision it centers on the boss who gathers his employees to tell them a big client had fired us after 20 years he hands out united tickets and asks them to visit their remaining clients when one employee asks the boss where he will go , the boss replies , to visit that old friend who fired us this morning
cornell university has announced the completion of the largest fundraising campaign in the history of higher education , raising 15 billion in five years , 250 million more than its original goal most of the money is to be used for financial aid , faculty salaries and academic programs , university officials said more than a third , 610 million , will go into the university s endowment , putting it in the top 10 in the country at 175 billion volunteers vied to raise the most money at elaborate events last fall in ithaca , ny , they put on skits , such as one in which someone playing gen george patton exhorted the troops to contribute tens of thousands of people put pieces into this jigsaw puzzle , said harold tanner , a chairman of the campaign cornell officials said the university s endowment was low compared with peers like harvard and yale , and that cornell needed to raise the endowment to remain competitive with them , particularly in subsidizing needy students several other institutions , including harvard , are also in the midst of campaigns to raise more than 1 billion in 1988 , cornell had an endowment of 38 , 652 per student , which was 77th in the country today , that number has almost doubled , to 77 , 078 , putting the university in top 40 even so , cornell s endowment per student remains a little more than a fifth of harvard s because universities use the income from their endowments to defray costs , particularly to keep tuitions down , a low endowment means higher tuition and less financial aid when they first discussed a fundraising campaign in 1987 , cornell s trustees considered the rising costs of financial aid , particularly their needblind admissions policy cornell s motto , coined by ezra cornell , is i would found an institution where any person can find instruction in any study cornell is an unusual mixture of a public and private university four of its 11 colleges make up new york state s land grant university , which receives money from the state and federal governments to subsidize the costs of agricultural and industrial studies the tuition in these schools is 8 , 490 for state residents the other colleges are private , and tuition for all undergraduates is 20 , 066 this year , similar to tuition at harvard and yale in the late 1950 s and early 60 s , peter meinig waited tables and graded papers to help his family pay for cornell many of his friends received financial aid so , three decades later , when mr meinig , now a venture capitalist , and his wife , nancy , also a cornell graduate , considered where to contribute , they decided to give 2 million to a scholarship fund for needy students with a potential for leadership the cost of higher education is a big number , mr meinig said we need to make it affordable to everybody more than 200 million of the money raised is dedicated to financial aid some 37 percent of cornell students receive grants directly from the university the university s president , hunter r rawlings 3d , said the increased endowment would mean tuition would rise at about the rate of inflation in the next few years another major goal of the campaign was faculty support the 146 million raised for that purpose will endow 118 positions , another area in which the university felt it was behind its peers with the endowments , cornell officials said , it would be easier to retain and recruit talented professors ronald p lynch , a graduate of cornell s college of agriculture in the 1950 s , gave 5 million to endow the deanship of the college the income from that fund will give the dean , now daryl b lund , more money in his budget to spend at his discretion i have been lucky enough to be very , very successful in life , said mr lynch , an investment banker who serves on the university s board a big part of that is the confidence i gained competing at cornell and surviving at cornell improving the undergraduate experience will be a priority in the next few years , said stephen h weiss , chairman of the board the board is studying the first two years of a student s time at cornell , looking for ways to give more access to professors president rawlings said he was committed to increasing the number of undergraduates who have the chance to do more research with professors it s a shame when undergraduates come into an institution where there are many great minds and do n't really participate in that intellectual life , he said even in his college days , mr weiss said , he found cornell a somewhat bewildering place , until the historian clinton rossiter took him under his wing mr weiss and five or six other students met every wednesday night for two years at professor rossiter s house , eating doughnuts and coffee and discussing politics and the presidency it changed my whole life , mr weiss said none of us who were in that group will ever forget it that was college for me it was the best experience i 've ever had to try to make sure that today s students have similar experiences , mr weiss gave 2 million to establish the stephen weiss presidential fellowship , an award for distinguished professors who commit their time and energy to teaching undergraduates since 1993 , three professors have been chosen to receive 5 , 000 a year for five years although cornell does not plan to have another major campaign , mr weiss said , officials will still try to raise money for specific projects in the college of arts and sciences , as well as to bolster basic sciences at the college of medicine in manhattan , and to continue increasing the financial aid pool cornell s campaign was the largest to date , but columbia , which has already raised more than 1 billion , and harvard are both trying to break the 2 billion mark cornell wo n't be no 1 for long , mr meinig said but that s all right we 'll be back
carolyn derosa , a senior at west islip high school , had never even hammered a nail before she joined habitat for humanity s campus chapter at her school as a volunteer two years ago since then she has learned the skills needed to help build three houses climbing up on the rafters , raising two walls and building a roof she is one of several hundred students from suffolk county who , like adult participants , promise to abide by habitat s three r s raise consciousness about the need for housing , raise money for construction and raise the walls of houses for habitat they have recently started building their third house on a recent saturday , she and other students were building a duplex on adams road in central islip near the house they built last year students built another house in bay shore the year before despite the constant cool drizzle on a recent saturday morning , about 10 students and other volunteers worked on the twostory , twofamily house megan dunn , a senior at st anthony s high school in huntington station , carried wood panels for the walls with another student we brought our own hammers , but they gave us these aprons for nails , megan said she took a few nails out of her apron these are 8 and these are 10penny size they are used for different things although most of the students never worked in construction before , they were easily taught by rick wertheim , a volunteer who serves as the construction director this is the 10th house he has supervised for habitat the kids have the energy and drive , he said it takes about 20 minutes to teach them what to do i show them basic carpentry techniques and explain why they are doing certain things today , we 're framing out the floor beams and decking for the second story colleen schiller and alex doran of st anthony s high school listened as mr wertheim explained about moving studs into the building area colleen was undaunted by a splinter in her finger as the two young women diligently picked up pieces of wood and carried them into the house , which was beginning to take form as the walls were nailed into place we 're learning as we go , colleen said it s kind of tough on the hands , though it will take about five weeks to complete the house bob carnevale , a contractor who has worked with habitat since 1989 , said we work with 20 kids at a time they come from a different school for two days at a time the target completion date for this house is may 19 , which will be marked with a fivemile walkathon ending at the house with a celebration besides student workers , the residents of the previously built habitat house near this site came to help with the building michelle mckenzie is a single mother who lives with her three children on one side of the house jasmine vlacich lives on the other with her husband and two children this is part of our sweat equity , ' said ms mckenzie , who was hammering nails into the walls with ease on the first floor after carrying a tray of drinks to the workers from her house working beside her was mrs vlacich we also helped build our own house , she said we 're working as a team we 're not only neighbors , we 've become friends the suffolk county chapter was started by the executive director , roger metcalf , who lives in rocky point this chapter consists mostly of high schools , but we now have college chapters starting at dowling , stony brook , malloy and st joseph s , he said campus chapters around the country consist mostly of college students , but they were difficult to recruit in suffolk they had a hard time making a commitment to the three r s we require , mr metcalf said most were busy working to get through school and did n't have enough time so we went to the high schools and have done very well while habitat for humanity has existed for 20 years , the high school campus chapters are only in their third year there are 30 chapters in suffolk county , the most in the country , and none in nassau county because of the shortage of vacant land there , said steven messinetti , director of campus chapters , who was raised in rocky point before the campus chapters were formed there he was introduced to habitat while in college suffolk county is our biggest high school chapter there are only three others in the country , mr messinetti said besides doing the building , students help raise money for housing projects last year the suffolk county chapter received the habitat founders award they pick the chapter that has contributed the most , said dennis murphy from miller place , who is coordinator of the suffolk county campus chapter last summer , six students were chosen to travel to west virginia to build a house in two weeks carolyn derosa was one of them she was also selected as the one student representative to sit on the family selection committee students stayed at cabins at thorn spring park campground and worked 8 to 10 hours a day at the site expenses were paid by the pritzkercousins family foundation of chicago students raise half the money needed for building a house last year , each of the 30 high schools in the program raised about 1 , 000 each through walkathons and other fundraisers central islip students are selling paper bricks this year , which are glued to the wall in the shape of a house a window is one price , a fence and chimney are another , said minell wilson , a guidance counselor and habitat leader at central islip high school she was a member of habitat as a college student this is the second year we are involved , she said the second half of the building cost is provided by businesses , which donate money , services and materials riverhead building supply and wbab radio station have sponsored the student building project by contributing 20 , 000 , mr metcalf said they also have arranged other fundraising and media events all the architectural work for suffolk county houses is donated by miller associates of miller place the total cost to build a threebedroom , twostory , twofamily habitat house in suffolk county is about 45 , 000 the land for the three houses by the students built in suffolk county was donated by the town of islip community development fund the houses are affordable for lowincome families because there is no profit in the sale price and no interest on the mortgage , which is held by habitat for about 20 years the money from mortgage payments goes into a revolving fund , the fund for humanity , which is used to build more houses homeowners must make a down payment and monthly mortgage payments and put hundreds of hours of labor into building other houses since its inception , habitat has built 40 , 000 houses around the world homeowners are chosen on the basis of financial need , willingness to become partners with habitat to build additional houses and ability to repay the loan carolyn was selected as the only student member of the family selection committee , which

washington , may 26 after years in the political wilderness , while official washington focused on deficit reduction , republican proponents of deep tax cuts are once again getting a serious hearing within their party they no longer call themselves supply siders , preferring the designation pro growth , because of the perceived failure of their policies in the reagan presidency and they have updated their 1980 s approach for the political realities of the 1990 s , seeing their best opportunity since 1980 to make their ideology central to the republican agenda they are arguing that both the condition of the economy today and the political fight faced by senator bob dole in his presidential campaign now make the time right to commit to the sweeping tax cuts they advocate and mr dole , long one of their strongest foes in the party , is listening this time he appears to be moving toward a tax cut , perhaps a 15 percent acrosstheboard reduction in the marginal tax rate , the percentage paid on the on last dollar earned trailing president clinton in the polls and still trying to define his economic message , mr dole displayed his willingness to refocus his policies when he met last week with steve forbes , whose unsuccessful presidential campaign was built on a flat tax advisers to mr dole say that if he is elected he is expected to embrace a longterm , fundamental overhaul of the tax system to bring rates down but more immediately he appears to be settling on a tax cut within the existing system as a down payment on longterm change , one adviser said some republicans , feeling they were burned once when supplyside tax cuts contributed to soaring budget deficits , remain wary and democrats have promised to attack any largescale taxcut proposals by asking which popular programs republicans would trim to pay for them economists continue to cast doubts on some of the central tenets of the supply siders' philosophy , like the argument that tax cuts will lead to higher savings rates wall street would almost certainly punish any taxcutting program that threatened to undo the progress made on the deficit by pushing up interest rates still , mr dole is leaning heavily for economic advice on a group of republican senators , including connie mack of florida , robert f bennett of utah and spencer abraham of michigan , who favor a much stronger emphasis on tax cutting strong support for the 15percent cut has come from bruce bartlett , a former reagan and bush administration official mr bartlett s taxcut strategy could also win the support of some dole staff members , several of whom are former aides to jack f kemp , the former housing secretary who is the current republican standard bearer for the growth wing of the party to some degree , the supply siders have been chastened by their experience in the reagan years , when tax cuts and continued increases in spending led to budget deficits that have yet to be controlled for the most part , the supply siders have dropped their argument that tax cuts can fully pay for themselves by generating greater economic growth most economists believe that that position , labeled voodoo economics by george bush , was ultimately disproved in the 1980 s and few of them still adhere to the hardline supplyside position that budget deficits do not matter but supply siders point to what they consider the success of gov christine todd whitman of new jersey in slashing both spending and taxes as a model for what can be achieved in today s political environment there was a period when republicans were embarrassed by the deficits , and through a conspiracy of silence allowed the democrats to blame reagan , mr bennett said then the realization that the clinton tax increases had slowed growth has caused a lot of republicans to come out and say that maybe on the growth side reagan had it right , and that we just needed more restraint on the spending side , mr bennett said dole has now figured out that you can have growth and still focus on the deficit there is a general consensus among economists that the american economy is currently not capable of growing any faster in the long run than 2 percent to 25 percent a year , a rate that is sluggish by historical standards the supplyside case is built on the argument that the economy is not growing at its full potential in large part because of a high tax burden president clinton , of course , has a different argument , that the slow but steady growth rates , low inflation and low unemployment rates of the last few years show that the economy is as sound as it has been in decades while there is no clear economic consensus about the precise benefits of tax cuts , the supply siders are throwing out an electionyear barrage of statistics to make their case mr bartlett calculated that federal taxes as a percentage of total economic output last year were just slightly less than the record 208 percent they reached before ronald reagan won the white house in 1980 supplyside adherents say the economy needed the kind of lift a progrowth policy can provide now more than ever before unless the economy can sustain higher growth rates , they contend , not only will people have trouble improving their living standards , but longerrange problems like paying the social security bill for today s working baby boomers will be close to insoluble moreover , they say , a progrowth strategy makes good political sense by providing a powerful way for republicans to capitalize on the economic anxiety felt by so many americans in particular , a tax reduction proposal would provide the republicans a way to sharpen their criticism of mr clinton for supporting a tax increase in 1993 what we should be saying is that the anxiety is coming about because of the high tax burden on the economy , senator mack said we are for lower marginal tax rates lower marginal tax rates allow the worker to keep more of his paycheck and businesses to keep more of their profits and to put that money back into investment that creates more jobs and opportunity none of the republicans have dared to begin listing where they would look for additional budget cuts to pay for any rate reductions indeed , supply siders acknowledge that they face a big job in convincing doubters that a big tax cut will not lead to rising budget deficits but with both democrats and republicans committed to balancing the budget by 2002 they said they could make a credible case that tax reduction and controlling the deficit could go hand in hand now , unlike in the 1980 s , we have done a reasonable job of beginning to restrain the growth of spending , said senator abraham , who advocates the 15percent acrosstheboard cut a tax cut that s growth oriented and dynamic in impact , against a backdrop of spending restraint , is not going to explode the deficit
with convention theatrics in full cry , talkshow producers are putting together their a lists for the campaign to come most of the prospective guests have done long service before the camera , and their faces are as tired as their phrases so i 've got a little list of personages who ought to be banned from the festivities constitutionally or institutionally incapable of enhancing public understanding , they 'd none of 'em be missed begin with all campaign apparatchiks you know the breed the hireling who praises , with enthusiastic tone , every pol in sight as long as it s his own the species was represented on meet the press on sunday by haley barbour , the chairman of the republican party , who did the usual cheerleader turn why put interviewers in the foolish position of pretending that any party functionary can say anything worth hearing about any subject involving a client \? more usefully , over on this week with david brinkley , gov pete wilson of california and gov john engler of michigan , though not about to utter anything unpleasant about the dolekemp combination , at least sounded as if they were in touch with reality lobbyists , particularly from the national rifle association and the tobacco companies their purrings are an insult to the audience sure , everybody has the right to make their case , even for the benefits of assault weapons , but let it come from legislators , who can at least be asked how much they received this fiscal year from the interests involved polling experts , those virtuosos of hindsight , who like stock market analysts are always able to explain after the fact developments that they failed to predict even when they 're right , they instinctively reduce issues to who s ahead today , a curse of television news all administration officials , whose tight leashes become strangling during presidential contests loath though one is to name names , it would be a mercy for the audience , and probably for the woman herself , to be spared attorney general janet reno , as awkward a performer as the cabinet boasts maybe it s camera fright , but uttering an unprogrammed thought in straight english has proved beyond her talents even the fluent leon panetta finds himself hedged in by his official role when he begins a sentence with frankly , go for the mute and finally , to borrow from koko apologetic statesmen of a compromising kind , such as what d'ye call him thing 'embob , and likewise nevermind , and st st st and what shisname , and also youknowwho the task of filling up the blanks i 'd rather leave to you but if all the favorites are blacklisted , how are the interview programs to fill their dance cards \? one way would be to offer more of the workmanlike backgrounders that kwami holman contributes to the jim lehrer newshour and that john martin and jim wooten have turned in for the brinkley program another alternative to flackery and flummery is to seek out men and women from universities and think tanks who actually know something about tough subjects like welfare and health care and are not totally incapacitated by jargon there must be some but to end on a realistic note , count on seeing all the aforementioned perpetrators on all news channels for the weeks ahead and then , of course , there are the candidates themselves even gilbert and sullivan could n't do anything about those fellows
rat bohemia by sarah schulman 232 pp new york dutton 1995 so many books about aids have been sentimental that it s a relief to read one that refuses to find transcendence in the act of dying as someone who is himself hiv positive , i tend to avoid reading aids novels the only thing i want to read is tomorrow s newspaper saying that a cure has been found but given my high level of resistance , i suppose my surrender to rat bohemia is all the more a testimonial to its gimleteyed accuracy , its zerodegree honesty , its charnelhouse humor aids burnout has at last found its bard in sarah schulman the heroine is rita , a woman from queens who kills rats for pest control , a local agency housed side by side with food and hunger as she admits , she pays careful attention to everything going on around her i want to be a witness to my own time because i 've had a sneaking suspicion lately that i'm gonna live a lot longer than most of the people i meet if i'm gonna be the only one still around to say what happened , i 'd better pay close attention now she is a lesbian , though anything but a separatist , since she befriends a wide spectrum of people , especially gay men who are dying from aids the strategy of observing gay men with aids from a lesbian perspective is ingenious rita has known the same rejection by her family as have other victims of homophobia in fact , the callousness of the families of lesbians and gay men is the major theme of this novel as an activist in act up she has also experienced all the frustration of fighting a losing battle but as a lesbian she announces to a bed partner , i 've never heard of anyone who really got hiv sexually from another woman both inside and outside the disease , rita is an ideal chronicler of a community in distress one of her defenses is to develop a gallows humor she refers to musical caskets and follow the bouncing corpse her cuban friend manuel observes i think they should change the name of this disease from aids to aida only leontyne price can do it justice operatic melodrama is exactly what rita avoids one thing i know for sure , she muses , is that aids is not a transforming experience i know that we tend to romanticize things like death based on some kind of religious model of conversion and redemption we expect that once people stare down their mortality in the mirror they will understand something profound about death and life that the rest of us have to wait until old age to discover but that s not what happens actually , people just become themselves but ever so much more so rita may be trying to improve her powers of memory , but she has little hope that the life being wasted and lost all around her will be recalled for very long her gay friend david is dying , and what disturbs him most is the idea that he and others who have already died will be forgotten he tells anecdotes about those who died a decade ago , hoping to keep their memories alive , but rita is starting to confuse one with another he goes on trips so he can write letters to friends in new york , letters that will stand as a memorial to him after he s gone i kept thinking of a friend of mine whose own prospects are bleak but who is devoting most of his time to preparing the slides and written records left behind by three dead friends for a new archive in new york devoted to artists who have died of aids so much memory , so few rememberers rita s best friend is another young lesbian , nicknamed killer , a professional plantwaterer who is clever about everything except how to get a decent job until she can find one , she rents out her own apartment as a bedandbreakfast to european tourists she picks up in expensive espresso bars the form of the book is puzzling i remember that back in the 1970 s feminists were always saying they rejected the aristotelian form that had dominated so much of western literature , with its tightly woven plot , its subordination of detail to overall design , its rigid economy of means perhaps rat bohemia is a thoroughly nonaristotelian contraption its first section , told from rita s point of view , introduces all the principal characters \( including david and killer \) and the theme that human beings have become the moral equivalent of vermin the second section , written from david s point of view , amplifies the idea that families are out to kill their gay children david s parents speak constantly of the deaths of obscure elderly relatives but never acknowledge the weekly losses that david must deal with his father has almost totally rejected him the only intermediary is the mother , herself acutely insensitive to her child s needs even when he was young he was disliked because he was too much a sissy there was always an invisible dave , one that had never existed and never could exist , that they expected to find , miraculously each morning at the breakfast table and when , instead , all they got was little sillywilly me , with limp wrists and a will of steel , little courageous sissywissy me , they were deeply angry

how stupid do they think we are \? if we are to believe pat buchanan , he did n't have a clue until the day before yesterday that his campaign cochairman larry pratt , commandant of gun owners of america , had any connections to the most racist , antisemitic and heavily armed organizations of the american far right but in fact every single piece of information about mr pratt that made headlines this week is old news , having previously been uncovered by watchdog groups and published in countless journalistic outlets , from rolling stone to playboy to this column in the year since oklahoma city no less credible is mr pratt s insistence that he not knowingly associated with kingpins of neonazi movements if mr pratt , as he says , despises racists with every fiber in his body and has nothing to do with the rabid separatistsupremacist militias why is he as ubiquitous at their conclaves as burning crosses once were at the ku klux klan \? mr pratt did n't just speak at the couple of meetings with aryan nations folks that you 've seen on the evening news , but at countless others featuring skinheads , klansmen and timothy mcveigh gunculture heroes like mark \( from michigan \) koernke and bo gritz \( who is fond of totting up the number of jews in the clinton administration \) kenneth stern of the american jewish committee chronicles some of the most egregious pratt sightings in his recently published book , a force upon the plain he shows how mr pratt is a key link between the racist religious right and the racist militia right but the story does n't end there foolish as it would be for americans to accept mr buchanan s or mr pratt s denials at face value , it would be an even bigger mistake to look at this incident as a freak , isolated occurrence farright gun nut turns up \( predictably \) in campaign of farright candidate mr pratt s associations with the right go well beyond those that have resurfaced this week and his associations with the republican party are hardly limited to mr buchanan as mr pratt is frequently in the company of pete peters the christian identity leader who preaches that jews are the devil s children and that racial minorities are subhuman so he also keeps company with gop revolutionaries not for nothing did mary jacoby of the capitol hill newspaper roll call describe mr pratt as almost a shadow congressman last fall the gun owners of america politicalaction fund contributed to 19 gop house and senate campaigns in '94 with the largest contribution going to steve stockman , the texas freshman who surfaced as a militia booster after oklahoma city dick armey , the house majority leader , even turned up on the letterhead of a prattrun religiousright subsidiary organization called committee to protect the family it has warned of homosexuals' intentionally contaminating blood banks to spread aids and has raised big bucks for randall terry s militant antiabortion organization , operation rescue among the other farright associations with which mr pratt is affiliated including english first , the immigrantbashing group is the council for national policy the cnp is a secretive umbrella organization of rightwing leaders whose membership also includes mr armey , mr stockman , the house majority whip tom delay , the senators jesse helms and lauch faircloth , not to mention radical religiousright gop puppeteers like ralph reed , pat robertson , paul weyrich and donald wildmon \( himself a buchanan campaign cochairman \) their next meeting will be in orlando in march no press allowed the good news is that none of mr buchanan s major opponents for the presidential nomination are plugged in to mr pratt and his crowd bob dole , to his credit , has been a pratt nemesis on the hill the bad news is that the pratt wing of the party is more powerful than mr buchanan s candidacy and certain to outlast it the mere removal of mr pratt as a campaign chairman or even the defeat of the campaign itself will not banish the forces he represents from the corridors of power all the fuss this week about mr pratt s role with a wouldbe president is , if anything , a distraction from examining the role he and his ideological soul mates play not just at the upper reaches of the republican party but in congress right now
bucharest , romania , march 22 what to do with one of the world s biggest , gaudiest and ugliest buildings \? the house that ceausescu built , said to be only slightly smaller than the pentagon , dominates this city as a sour legacy of one of communism s craziest dictators while nicolae ceausescu starved the people and let them freeze through hard winters , he ordered 700 architects to erect a socalled people s palace with reception rooms the size of soccer fields and corridors as wide as streets renaissance , rococo , baroque , byzantine , transylvanian name it , and the style will be found somewhere in the interior , often mixed up in the same room slabs of pink and white marble line many of the halls , heavily carved oak friezes decorate many of the ceilings and , on the exterior , the artificial stone \( they ran out of real stone \) that covers the sides and back is beginning to turn black now an international urban design competition is being held to figure out what to do with this spectacular example of totalitarian architecture , along with the miles of badly designed apartments and leveled spaces that encircle it tearing the people s palace down or converting it into a fun fair have been considered but turned down and even though bucharest suffers from a severe housing shortage , local architects say the proportions of the people s palace are all wrong to convert it into apartments it is a gargantuan building , there is nothing you can do about that , said mariana celac , the vice president of the society of architects here the competition is about how to make the area around it human and useful this is like a wound in the city s body , an area of destruction and violence , and we want to heal the wound for many bucharest residents , the people s palace evokes feelings of revulsion to make room for it , in the early 1980 s mr ceausescu ordered the flattening of some of the city s most valued real estate fourteen churches and monasteries , the jewish quarter , examples of gracious postbyzantine and avantgarde architecture , not to mention private homes , were demolished the destruction was run like a military campaign people recall seeing the dictator s motorcade moving along as , with a flick of a finger , he indicated the blocks he wanted torn down to make way for his palace and its surrounding web of roads and buildings then legions of architects were called in none of them , said nicoleta toma , an architect who worked on the project , were given an overall theme only mr ceausescu and his favorite architect , anka petrescu , were allowed to know what the structure would look like , hence the kitschy hodgepodge interior and the severe exterior , ms toma said like many architects who worked on mr ceausescu s folly , ms toma said she did so because it was the only job around as a 30yearold architect just out of university , designing for the people s palace was a way to stay in bucharest , she said her responsibility was to design a reception room for mr ceausescu s wife , elena , who was feared as much as her husband it was a ridiculous assignment , said ms toma , who has submitted a design in the competition to change what she helped create she was a very ugly , very bad woman who did n't inspire me all my friends were joking with me , 'how could you make such nice columns for her \? ' ms toma said she imagined other women in leadership positions margaret thatcher , for example as she designed the carved cherry wood interior offset by beige and rose tapestries i never met elena ceausescu she had her own favorite architect , who was always contradicting ceausescu s architect when the ceausescus were toppled and executed in 1989 , only 60 percent of the interior of the palace was completed ever since , there have been arguments over how to finish it and what to use it for the gargantuan halls have been put aside for use as a conference center mars , the american candy company , rented one of the smaller rooms for a business meeting this month the romanian parliament is supposed to move in , and the building has been renamed the palace of the parliament but some politicians , particularly from the opposition parties , who hold ceausescu in contempt , have been reluctant to give their stamp of approval and no sessions have been held there in the meantime , ms toma is hoping the international jury will notice her entry in the first round of judging in the competition , which is to take place in cannes next month the jury includes kenneth frampton of the united states and distinguished italian , french and british architects , ms toma proposes an overhead monorail to run down the threemile road that mr ceausescu built as a gateway to his folly she envisions a glass pyramid that partly encapsulaes the building she would move a 400yearold bell tower from a destroyed monastery back into the palace gardens and construct a reflecting pool around it and she has designed what she calls romantic medieval bridges to improve traffic flow between the area that was rebuilt by ceausescu and the rest of bucharest i want people to no longer feel like slaves looking up at that building , she said the challenge is how to get it back to the people photo romanians seem agreed the people s palace of nicolae ceausescu , the former dictator , is ugly a competition is under way to figure out what to do with the building , which is said to be almost as big as the pentagon \( reuters for the new york times \)
cleveland is the place where the river caught fire , right \? yes , in 1969 , to be exact but it is also the birthplace of the first traffic light and the salisbury steak among its civic heroes is eliot ness , who came to cleveland after his work with the untouchables in chicago and cleaned up crime but lost in a run to become mayor this information comes from the second edition of the encyclopedia of cleveland history , being printed this year to honor the bicentennial of the settling of the mosquitoinfested marshland by none other than moses cleaveland case western reserve university and the western reserve historical society are jointly publishing the encyclopedia , which will go to press this summer it s a community service , said david d van tassel , a case western history professor and the encyclopedia s senior editor in addition to the encyclopedia , case western is also preparing a new companion volume , the dictionary of cleveland biography those profiled range from john d rockefeller , who got his start with cleveland oil refineries , to charlie lupica , who in 1949 set a world record for sitting atop a flagpole he had vowed to come down only if the indians regained first place in the american league they never did and he was up there for 117 days john grabowski , another case western history professor , said the project s financial backers were particularly attracted to the separate book of biographies but that did n't mean they could get their names in one of the rules is that they all must be dead , he said the first edition of the encyclopedia , published in 1987 , was used as a model for later efforts in indianapolis and new york after a lastminute updating , this one will include the saga of how the browns abandoned cleveland , and the city succeeded in keeping their name
atlanta , june 22 he started a foot lower this time in the pole vault , but if there was caution in choosing a height , there was none in his approach to the bar dan o'brien paused only for a moment on the runway , allowing himself no chance to think of failure then he began his runup and easily lifted himself over 14 feet 9 inches today in the decathlon four years ago , the failure to clear a height had kept him off the olympic team today at the olympic trials , the pole vault propelled him into first place o'brien , the threetime world champion , kept jumping until he had matched his career best in a decathlon , 17 3 4 then he threw a career best of 214 feet in the javelin and on an afternoon when the sprinter michael johnson and the hurdler jack pierce challenged world records , so did o'brien in winning the olympic trials with 8 , 726 points he finished ahead of steve fritz \( 8 , 636 \) and chris huffins \( 8 , 546 \) , who recorded personal bests in 7 of the 10 events johnson ran 1970 seconds in the 200meter semifinals , faster than the world record of 1972 seconds set by pietro mennea of italy 17 years ago , but the aiding wind was 604 miles an hour , above the limit of 447 miles per hour allowed for records pierce , a bronze medalist at the 1992 summer games , ran the fourthfastest 110meter hurdle race , 1294 seconds , in today s semifinal and o'brien threatened to shatter his own world record of 8 , 891 points in the decathlon but it was 111 degrees on the track at olympic stadium one of the decathletes , aric long , passed out o'brien s own face was red with sunburn , and his body was exhausted and depleted he could not maintain his intended pace at 1 , 500 meters , finishing in 5 minutes 1201 seconds when 4 4348 would have put him beyond his own world record still , it was an impressive performance in the oppressive heat most important , o'brien had won and made the olympic team , redeeming himself for one of the most startling failures at the 1992 olympic trials i had dreamed of being here at this time , said o'brien , a native of klamath falls , ore when you think there s no possible way you wo n't make it here , it s normal this feels normal , to win a national championship and to be going for the gold medal as high as he went on that initial polevault clearance of 149 , though , o'brien could not surpass the bombast of the public address announcer at olympic stadium dan o'brien cleared the bar and soared over four years of criticism and anxiety , exorcising the noheight demon , intoned frank zarnowski , the country s foremost decathlon expert o'brien , who will be 30 on the eve of the olympics , had started the day in second place , 69 points behind huffins huffins had delivered career bests in four of the five events on friday , including the fastest 100 meters in the history of the decathlon , 1022 seconds still , the pole vault is the most technical of the decathlon s 10 events , and even with vast improvement , huffins s style still lacks grace and fluidity he appears to be trying to throw himself over the bar even with a personal best of 159 , he saw his lead slip away today as he paused on the runway for his first jump , o'brien told himself , do it right , be aggressive , do n't worry about what s going to happen when you miss , because you 're not he cleared 149 comfortably , and he stood in the pit and pumped his arms in celebration and relief he had been criticized for waiting until the bar was raised to 159 to begin jumping at the 1992 olympic trials in new orleans , and he invariably responded that he would have done nothing different today , he did , opening a full foot lower it seemed the prudent thing to do , considering that , in retrospect , a jump of only 92 1 4 would have qualified him for the olympic team four years ago this time he took no chances he needed to clear a height as much for his confidence as for his point total a jump of 149 would not win many state high school meets , much less the olympic trials , but the moment was so cathartic for o'brien that he began slapping highfives with the other decathletes i was pretty happy , o'brien said at that point , i knew i had made it on the olympic team , no matter what i jumped after that encouraged by that opening vault , o'brien effortlessly cleared 151 on his first attempt again on his first try , he sailed well over 159 , the height at which he had failed three times in new orleans , costing himself a spot on the 1992 olympic team and scuttling the dan and dave ad campaign by reebok o'brien had become distracted and panicked at the 1992 trials , and he had not warmed up properly , mistakenly believing that because he was sweating , his muscles were loose today , after working this season with a sports psychologist , he seemed much better prepared after missing at 164 3 4 , o'brien calmly cleared the height on his next jump huffins , the 1993 collegiate decathlon champion at california , had entered these trials with a personal best in the pole vault of only 151 he was second to o'brien after the first day of the 1992 trials , only to fade to 15th but huffins , 26 , has improved measurably since then today , he exceeded his personal best by eight inches in the pole vault , clearing 159 if you do n't think you can slay the dragon , you might as well not step up , huffins said still , he could not maintain his slight hold on first place after the first seven events , as o'brien kept his composure and kept jumping higher after he aborted his first runup at 168 3 4 , suffering a violation of the twominute time limit per jump , he made the height on his second attempt then , after huffins had left the competition , o'brien began to pad his lead he jumped 17 3 4 on his first attempt , matching his career high in a decathlon pole vault he has jumped 172 3 4 in an open pole vault today , he exited after missing three attempts at 174 1 2 i was n't out there thinking , 'gosh , this is ironic , ' o'brien said but the vault has always been the key for me it was in losing four years ago , and it was again in winning today inside track lavonna martinfloreal , the 1992 olympic silver medalist , was scratched from the second round of the women s 100meter hurdles saturday after straining a stomach muscle in the first round on friday gail devers , the world

buffalo , jan 21 a fire spread quickly through a warehouse and caused 12 million in damage to a factory that was planning to relocate in two weeks , officials said today investigators were trying to find out what caused the fire saturday night at airtek products on buffalo s east side authorities estimated that 400 , 000 in damage was done to the building and another 800 , 000 to its contents airtek products manufactures drying units for large air compressors and employs about 50 people none of the workers were inside the twostory building , which is about the size of a city block no injuries were reported fire officials were concerned about the safety of firefighters because propane , acetylene and other combustible products were stored in the building raymond arno , the company s president , said insurance probably would not completely cover the damage he said he did not know how the fire would affect his plans to move the business to lancaster , a suburb of buffalo
washington , may 15 after six weeks of trying to run for president from the well of the senate , bob dole finally conceded today that his strategy was not working but while he can take himself out of congress and get a new backdrop for his speeches , this congress will inevitably remain a big part of the dole candidacy he cannot escape being judged to some degree on the record it compiles and by its personality even after he goes it is uncertain who will succeed mr dole as senate majority leader there is likely to be a contested vote for the job , but just who wins will not matter much in the short run whoever it is will have less skill as a deal maker , but in recent months mr dole has not cut as many deals as he used to because he has almost lost his balance leaning to the right to please the conservatives one conservative , representative robert k dornan of california , speaking of the most likely successor , said today that because of trent lott , everybody thinks that it will get more conservative , but bob dole votes almost as conservatively as trent in any case , the resignation will not make democrats stop running television commercials referring to dolegingrich speaker newt gingrich , as the democrats know , remains much less popular than mr dole and while mr gingrich has managed to keep largely off television screens for a few weeks , that probably cannot last it s one thing for the speaker of the house to defer to his party s choice for the white house and mr gingrich said today , the new senate leader will join me in being a junior partner to the presidential nominee but no one who enjoys the sight of a microphone the way mr gingrich does can take a back seat to mr lott , don nickles , thad cochran , pete domenici or whoever succeeds mr dole as majority leader and mr gingrich in the spotlight is not good politics for the republican party this congress s record is a fair campaign issue , for or against mr dole and it is mostly written already largely in veto messages republicans argue that they should get credit for what they tried to enact , and president clinton and the democrats should be blamed for failures so far , however , the public blames the republicans just as it blamed the democrats for failure when they controlled congress in 1994 but mr dole , who has voted for everything that passed and much that did not , may be able to make the case for credit and blame more clearly than any democrat did in the scattered terrain of the 1994 election the record of laws enacted is not likely to change much between now and election day , and even the total number of vetoes may not get much higher if senate democrats filibuster to spare mr clinton that role but there are two measures that may be strikingly affected by mr dole s departure one is the kennedykasssebaum health insurance bill , written to make insurance coverage portable from job to job although it passed 100 to 0 in the senate , it has been hung up for three weeks since mr dole sought to get conferees to attach a medical savings account beloved by house republicans but rejected by the senate only senator dole has the authority to back down to a compromise , something he has frequently told senator edward m kennedy of massachusetts that he wants mr dole told senator nancy landon kassebaum and other kansans the same thing today , saying he wanted to see the bill passed before he left it may have to be without him the bill may be dead , because none of his potential successors are as inclined to compromise on health insurance as he is the other issue that his departure may affect is the one that has dogged him and symbolized the impossibility of his dual role since march the minimum wage the realities of capitol hill enabled democrats to keep him from running , as he expected , as the man who could get things done on big issues that mattered to ordinary americans instead , he was coming across as the man who could not get the senate out of gridlock he was not confronting bill clinton he was scrapping with tom daschle and mr kennedy in fact , his dual role as candidateleader made mr daschle s job as democratic leader easier by unifying the democrats as they filibustered to force a vote to raise the minimum wage to 515 an hour , from 425 mr dole moved slowly on the issue , but ultimately wanted to agree with the democrats and get it out of the way , only to be stopped by democrats demanding more and by house republicans balking him a few days ago he walked the gantlet of reporters between the senate chamber and his office , hearing question after question on that single issue he muttered to a friend , i'm so sick of the minimum wage , i ca n't stand it one close senate friend , alan k simpson of wyoming , predicted today that with mr dole off the stage , a way would be found to vote on the issue and settle it but democrats were skeptical , saying he seemed readier to negotiate than mr lott and other republicans , and had the argument that the issue was hurting his campaign for president by staying as leader until june 11 , senator dole probably insures a short , quick fight to succeed him the earlier idea , that he would only give up the duties , and perhaps the title , of leader would have produced a session drawn out by competition to see who could cooperate least with the democrats and bash the president hardest but just how that will play out is unclear on most issues , mr dole has gotten more conservative over the years , as has his party even so , it is a striking reminder of how republicans have changed to note that with mr lott and mr cochran in the race , the chances are better than even that mr dole s successor will come from mississippi , a bedrock democratic state that had no republican senators when mr dole came to the senate in 1968 and now has two that successor will share power , at least this year with a georgian in speaker gingrich and when kansas first elected mr dole to the house in 1960 , georgia elected 10 democratic representatives and no republicans , while providing john f kennedy his biggest majority finally , candidates do all sorts of things in an effort to win the presidency , from abandoning principles to wearing silly hats mr dole , for anyone who knows him , has done something that matters a great deal by resigning from the senate this is the modernday political equivalent of henri iv of navarre , who abandoned his protestant faith in 1593 to become king of france , saying , paris is well worth a mass the senate , with all its ritual and liturgy , has been bob dole s church since 1969 photos senator trent lott of mississippi , above , the majority whip , inhis washington office , is among the potential successors to senator bob dole as majority

london the squalor of rural britain before designer kitchens had to be seen to be believed this writer first saw it in the early 1960 s at a rundown farmhouse where two cambridge graduates had fled to escape the wicked city , have too many children and pretend to farm only one end of the long kitchen table was ever cleared for what passed for meals the other end supported assorted clothing , agricultural implements , battered copies of the new statesman and a child s potty on sunday , as the assembled multitude sat down to dinner , a horse poked his nose through the door , and the mother of the family , finding herself a plate short for the apple crumble , reached for the cat s dish on the floor , rinsed it under the tap and filled it with the rest luckily , the newly arrived american had been given cold comfort farm as an orientation text , so there was no surprise but it was equally clear that only in a book could miss flora poste exist a practical young englishwoman who detests messes and , descending from london upon her unspeakable country relatives in darkest sussex , succeeds in organizing them out of theirs stella gibbons s classic novel was her first , published in 1932 when she was 30 she wrote it , so legend has it , on the underground , on daily journeys to and from work on various fleet street newspapers recently called by one critic \( julie burchill in the sunday times of london \) very probably the funniest book ever written , cold comfort farm was an instant hit in the england of george v , a time when debutantes were presented at court , contraception was for sophisticates and psychoanalysis was an exotic and ludicrous foreign import and now cold comfort farm , the movie , which opened to good notices in half a dozen theaters in the united states on may 10 , is being introduced to a wider audience turning a wellknown book into a movie is fraught with peril very few make the transition successfully , often only at the price of total transformation a complex story can become a simpler and more personal and pictorial one , as happened , one can argue , with both gone with the wind 57 years ago and sense and sensibility last fall the obvious problem is the loss of the authorial voice passages of description that belong to the unseen narrator are either assigned to one of the characters to speak aloud , thus requiring them to know more than that character should , or are omitted altogether satire compounds the difficulty mocking words do not make mocking pictures often the joke disappears entirely , as with john updike s witches of eastwick , or one is added where there was none before the macabre humor of dr strangelove emerged from a straight technothriller , peter george s red alert \( written under the pen name peter bryant \) cold comfort farm makes little sense without the social context skillfully conveyed by the author s controlled ironic prose the plot depends upon the unfeelingness of the english upper classes of the 1930 s the revulsion from sentiment flora poste is an ungrieving orphan of 19 whose education expensive , athletic and prolonged was bestowed by parents whom she hardly ever saw and whose sudden deaths of spanish influenza left her with every art and grace save that of earning her own living but the director john schlesinger and the writer , the novelist malcolm bradbury making the film for the bbc and thames television faced an even tougher obstacle cold comfort farm is a literary satire it parodies the kind of novel epitomized by d h lawrence s rainbow , which romanticizes what gibbons described with mock admiration as nature at her rawest , in man and in landscapes flora aspires to become such a novelist and moves into a squalid farmhouse with her cousins , the rural starkadders , not only to have a home but , she says , to begin collecting material florid style is relatively easy to parody on the printed page gibbons gets her spoof off to a magnificent start , with an effusive introduction to a friend , a writer of literature , whose books give me \( in the midst of the vulgar and meaningless bustle of newspaper offices \) joy to help reviewers and others who are not always sure whether a sentence is literature or whether it is just sheer flapdoodle , she says that she has indicated her book s finer passages , as if in a baedeker travel guide , with one , two or three stars thus flora makes a twostar arrival in sussex , as dawn crept over the downs like a sinister white animal at the denouement , as gibbons pairs off her characters in unlikely combinations of town and country , she allows herself to mention lawrence by name her intellectual mr mybug , a londoner who sees the countryside as a place rampant with sexual symbol , asks the starkadder maid to be his wife on the ground that , by god , d h lawrence was right when he had said there must be a dumb , dark , dull , bitter bellytension between a man and a woman , and how else could this be achieved save in the long monotony of marriage
miami , sept 27 when bob dole arrived on thursday here in dade county , the population center of a state his aides believe he must win but where polls show him trailing , he made only a single campaign stop , for a 42minute questionandanswer forum at a huge and gritty warehouse in the northwest corner of miami this was the 15th in a series of listening to america sessions that mr dole has led since he was nominated for president six weeks ago the loosely structured forums , often on a particular topic like his economic plan , have become a dominant component of mr dole s effort to unseat president clinton , taking up far more time than he devotes to major policy addresses and even rivaling the time he spends at more customary political rallies as he embarks on the final weeks of what his campaign organization views as an increasingly problematic race , however , mr dole s experience with the listening to america format suggests that its value to his bid for the presidency remains far from proven mr dole s aides maintain that the events afford him the kind of favorable coverage from local news media that the candidate says he has not found in the national press it may well bore elite reporters , john buckley , the nominee s communications director , said of the format but it does get covered , and we create news on topics that we are interested in creating news on but the coverage by newspapers and television stations here in the aftermath of mr dole s visit , as in other places where he has taken his listening to america tour , suggests otherwise miami news organizations either were critical of thursday s event in their accounts or , perhaps worse , nearly ignored it the questions were mostly softballs , but even then dole did n't always connect , michael putney , a veteran political reporter for the abc affiliate here , told his viewers in his evening report on thursday none of the miami television stations led their earlyevening newscasts with mr dole s appearance one devoted just 30 seconds to it another relegated it to the bottom of the news lineup , after reports on the resurgence of pan am and valujet , a high school student s unsuccessful effort to blow up his mathematics teachers and a traffic accident on interstate 95 all the television reports on mr dole s visit focused on his political difficulties rather than on his message , and portrayed the forums themselves as staged this morning the miami herald put its account on the front page of the second section beyond the campaign s objective of local coverage , mr dole regularly points to these events as an opportunity for him to hear the unfiltered views of americans ordinarily little involved in the political process but here , as has been typical elsewhere , the audience had been stocked by local republican leaders , and those present were for the most part gentle in their handling of him the theme of the forum was women in business , and by design the audience was all women , mostly cubanamericans interviews with some of them before a dole aide ordered a reporter to stop talking to them and leave the floor also suggested that they were nearly all republicans who supported mr dole the nominee s aides say these are the kind of easytoarrange , photographically alluring events that win attention for candidates but even mr dole s supporters question the value of having him pose for pictures , as in this case , in a warehouse with stacks of plastic containers behind him and cases of heinz worcestershire sauce in front of him further , said one former dole media adviser , mike murphy , who left the campaign in a recent shakeup , the candidate s organization needs to make the forums more newsworthy and less sterile mr dole s difficulties with the listening to america forums might be less significant had he not invested so large a share of his relatively modest campaign schedule in them from the start , the events have been a subject of fairly critical newspaper accounts that have portrayed them as staged and suggested that rather than giving mr dole a taste of the country s concerns , they simply echo the nominee s own views doggone it , susan feeney wrote in the dallas morning news , mr dole was 'listening to america , ' and it sounded a lot like him mr buckley , the dole campaign s communications director , dismisses such news accounts as an example of elite reporters' having to show off in fact , though , similar criticism can be seen and heard in smaller media markets' local coverage as well and it appears to have rankled the candidate when the forum here opened with a question about his tax cut proposal , mr dole , who has not held a formal news conference since march , devoted part of his answer to something else , remarking with evident irritation that he understood that a newspaper reporter had been inquiring as to how this event had come about i know somebody was here earlier , he said , some reporter saying 'well , these are all the same who s going to do this \? who s going to do that \? ' he must have left disappointed , because it s not staged , not rehearsed we 're here to talk about america the woman whose question led to that response was alina garcia , a beauty salon owner , who said she had been invited to the forum after calling friends on the local republican committee mr dole embarked on these sessions after the republican national convention , and they are clearly patterned on the performance there by his wife , elizabeth but where mrs dole took a handheld microphone and wandered comfortably through the audience for her chat , her husband customarily stays settled in his chair , occasionally rising to answer questions but evincing none of the same level of ease with this kind of campaign banter such events are nothing new in american politics richard m nixon was among the first to use them as early as 1979 , george bush , in his own quest for the presidency , was conducting ask george bush forums , in which he sat on a stool in the middle of a community assembly and mr clinton made them a regular part of his 1992 campaign but as marlin fitzwater , press secretary in the bush white house , noted the other day , the approach has varied over the years in 1992 , president bush , following mr clinton s lead , began holding such forums in local television studios the advantage was that doing so dramatically expanded the audience the disadvantage , as mr fitzwater recalled , was that the television stations helped choose those attending mr murphy , the former dole media adviser , said that before leaving the campaign he had urged that the nominee adopt the studio approach but the campaign stayed with untelevised forums here in miami , the audience was selected by both the campaign and a longtime dole supporter , remedios diaz oliver , the president of all american containers inc , whose warehouse was the setting for the event one in attendance , pamela wildecole , told mr dole , i believe that the difference between hillary and bill and you and liddy is character , is decency , honor and character at that , those in mr dole s listening to america audience burst into applause and , as one , rose to their feet to end the session with a prolonged standing ovation photo bob dole at a listening to america forum in miami , the only campaign stop he made after arriving in dade county on thursday \( stephen crowley the new york times \)

if it is the aspiring writer s dream to publish a book while very young , the reality is that it happens rarely truman capote was 24 , carson mccullers , 23 gore vidal and brett easton ellis both 21 , and joyce maynard , 20 , when their first books appeared in print next spring , g p putnam s sons , a unit of mca , which is owned by the seagram company , plans to publish necessary madness , a first novel by a writer whose book has easily managed to snag foreign rights , audiocassette and bookofthemonth club sales and who is even younger than the writers mentioned above indeed , when putnam made its offer on march 30 , the author , jenn crowell , was three weeks shy of her 18th birthday , and in the midst of completing both her senior year of high school and her first year of college in a special program at goucher college in towson , md ms crowell s novel was the first book acquired by putnam s executive editor , liza dawson , who joined the company in march and paid around six figures , she said , for a twobook contract , which includes an asyetunwritten second novel the record for a first novel was 315 million , paid by the dell unit of bertelsmann ag in 1994 to nicholas evans for the horse whisperer , but ms crowell s book cost far more than the average 5 , 000 to 10 , 000 for a first novel carolyn mays , the british editor , said she spent in the l200 , 000 range to buy the british rights to the two books she said that her company , hodder stoughton , plans to market ms crowell s first novel as a love story for the end of the 20th century putnam was able to buy world rights from ms crowell s agent , jane gelfman international rights have become increasingly valuable and agents are reluctant to part with them putnam was able to do so because ms crowell was an unknown , and also because when ms gelfman sent the book to four publishers , two quickly returned it , one liked it but decided against it , and putnam was left the sole bidder since then , putnam has more than recouped its initial investment through foreignrights sales the company received about onefifth to onequarter of the money paid by each new publisher one big foreign sale can stir interest in other countries the subsidiaryrights director of putnam , cathy fox , used the british sale to help sign publishers in denmark , finland , germany , italy , norway and sweden a french auction and sales to other foreign publishers are pending the other publishers , unlike the british , have only bought rights to the first book , so if that succeeds , ms crowell s second book is expected to bring putnam , and her , another wave of foreign earnings people familiar with the deals , who insisted on anonymity , said that the foreign publishers , excluding the british , have paid a total of 340 , 000 in addition , book club rights have been sold to the bookofthemonth club , a unit of time warner inc so , as ms dawson said , this book is already a success the book , set in london , concerns a 30yearold american woman her husband , a british artist , and their 8yearold son in the brief novel ms dawson said it was expected to be 160 pages the heroine must come to terms with her husband s death from leukemia as well as the ghosts of her unhappy childhood although ms dawson did not hide the fact that the author s age gives putnam a tremendous publicity advantage , she maintained that what is so special is that this is not a comingofage story about the inner life of a 17yearold and ms mays , the british editor , found ms crowell s ability to get down the details of english life extraordinary as well ms crowell , whose first trip to england is scheduled for later this month financed by her book sale said she wanted to write about the evocation of grief , the ability of children to comprehend such emotions , and their desire to have somebody who understands the deaths of ms crowell s grandfather and her stillborn brother , when she was 8 or 9 , brought her the kind of grief that i came into as my subject , and the plot clicked when she read an article in vogue magazine about a photographer who shot images of herself in the final stages of cancer ms crowell , who joined a writers' workshop when she was almost 15 , said that she learned through reading , particularly writers like jeanette winterston and margaret atwood , and is indebted to english television sitcoms and the comic novels of sue townsend for her knowledge of british life she also acknowledges debts to many teachers , including two writers in particular since ms crowell was 12 , a family friend , nancy springer , the edgar awardwinning author of books for young adults , has been a great resource and most importantly , the novelist madison smartt bell , author of all souls' rising and writerinresidence at goucher , encouraged ms crowell s application for early admission and worked with her in his seminar to lineedit her manuscript he got in touch with ms gelfman his own agent on behalf of ms crowell he did not , however , initially disclose ms crowell s age , nor did ms gelfman , when she first dealt with ms dawson at putnam mr bell said i 've had students as good as jenn , but none of them have been just 17 i was astonished because of her youth , and yet the book was not about youth culture but then dealing with her is like talking to someone with at least 10 more years of life experience as for ms crowell , she said that unlike her heroine , she has enjoyed a happy childhood when not at goucher , ms crowell lives in jacobus , pa , with her mother , stepfather and halfbrother since the sale of her book which has not yet been read by her family she has had to hire an accountant , deal with the inevitable jealousy of peers , and begin to come to terms with her success at the same time , she has also been busy preparing for her high school graduation photo jenn crowell , 18 , who has sold her first novel to g p putnam s sons , is finishing

washington , feb 6 frustrated by the district of columbia s fiscal crisis and the city s lack of representation in congress , a new citizens group has begun a campaign to give most of washington back to maryland under a plan that preserves the capitol , the mall and the white house as a federal enclave , maryland would get back the 70 square miles it donated for a national capital in 1791 virginia had provided an additional 40 square miles but reclaimed the land in 1846 we 're not saying it s the only solution , said lawrence mirel , a lawyer who was elected last month as president of the committee for the capital , a 30member group promoting retrocession but any plan devised for the district must be economically viable and provide full and equal democratic rights ours is the only alternative that does for now , the idea has no known support beyond a suggestion by speaker newt gingrich last year that district residents be allowed to vote in maryland , a generous offer given the likelihood that washington s population of 554 , 000 would give maryland one more representative in the house , probably a democrat in washington , the ratio of registered democrats to republicans is more than 10 to 1 i ca n't remember even a ripple of interest any time the idea has been raised , said john allem , a spokesman for mayor marion s barry jr dianna rosborough , a spokeswoman for gov parris n glendening of maryland , said mr glendening would not consider retrocession until a serious discussion of the issues made clear what it would mean for the state district residents who once pined for statehood , now virtually a lost cause with a republicancontrolled congress , view retrocession as ultimate defeatism , as mark plotkin , a local political commentator and statehood supporter put it sure , these are rough times , mr plotkin said , but this is a throwinthetowel group still , something has to change , mr mirel insisted , pointing to a local economic tailspin that has led to a decline in services , a shrinking tax base , a steady exodus of middleclass residents to the suburbs , hundreds of millions of dollars in overspending by the city government and , finally , a financial control board , which congress created last year to restore order progress has been slow with congress unwilling to increase the annual federal payment the district receives in lieu of taxes , mr barry and the control board remain uneasy partners in efforts to cut spending and the size of government and while they now haggle over 150 million in spending cuts for the 1996 fiscal year , which began last october , streets in full view of the white house remain covered with snow more than three days after the last storm in recent years , a variety of solutions have been proposed to lift washington out of its economic doldrums , but none has generated much support they have included granting statehood , which congress opposes returning the city government to congressional control , which local elected leaders oppose , and taxing commuters , which members of the maryland and virginia congressional delegations say they will not allow but mr mirel said none of those initiatives would solve the city s two most pressing needs lifting the local economy and giving local residents voting representation in congress currently , the district has one nonvoting member of the house mr mirel said that for maryland , the economic benefits of retrocession would be enormous , raising the state s population to 55 million , or to 15th place from 19th , according to 1992 census data , and creating a strong baltimorewashington market that could compete more effectively with pennsylvania for new businesses the political advantage for district residents would be full representation in congress , where maryland has eight representatives mr mirel , a 35year resident of the city , acknowledged that gathering support for retrocession will be difficult but he predicted that within a year or so , more people will view it as the logical way to proceed eleanor holmes norton told me i'm dreaming , mr mirel said of the district s delegate in congress and none of the elected leaders in maryland have endorsed or embraced the idea but fairly soon , i think , people will begin to realize this is it this is the only answer
the people arrested in monday night s raid on a brooklyn building were followers , the police say , of a labor organizer turned cult leader who died last year , a man whose past is clouded by aliases , murky organizations and questionable claims gerald william doeden , known for much of his life as eugenio perenteramos , was the founder and leader of the national labor federation , a group that , according to cult experts and the police , operated through a series of front organizations around the country some of the front groups were based in the three buildings on carroll street in crown heights where the police arrested 35 people and seized nearly 50 weapons on his death last year , mr perenteramos who was also known by the name gino perenti was hailed by his followers in a handbill as america s most experienced and successful labor leader he and his organizations held themselves up as important labor groups and revolutionaries , but neither labor leaders nor more prominent radicals knew of them i 've never heard of these guys , said stanley cohen , a lawyer whose clients range from east village squatters to mousa mohammed abu marzook , the political leader of hamas , the palestinian political group the police and people who investigate cults contend that mr perenteramos s many groups were , in fact , nothing more than cults posing as radical political organizations chip berlet , who has written extensively on cults and is a senior analyst for political research associates in cambridge , mass , which studies extremist groups , said that mr perenteramos s groups sought out troubled young people , housed them in communal quarters , deprived them of sleep and convinced them that they were the true leftist underground others also questioned the group s legitimacy he was a smalltime operator who obviously got kicks out of controlling 40 to 100 people , said janja a lalich , a california researcher who writes about cults and has studied mr perenteramos s followers i do n't think money was the big thing for him power was the big thing , power and sex in the 1970 s and early 1980 s , she said , female members of mr perenteramos s organization were expected to sleep with him she said the members were cut off from the outside world , and that mr perenteramos would give hourslong lectures , beginning at 2 am mr perenteramos adopted a partly spanish surname , said he was of mexican heritage and that he was born in montana , in 1935 cult researchers contend that he was not hispanic and was born in minnesota , in 1935 or 1937 ruth mikkelsen , who was married to mr perenteramos from 1960 to 1962 , said he had changed his name several times and described him as mentally unstable there seems to be agreement that in the 1960 s , he worked as a disk jockey in san francisco and ran a book store that sold communist literature he often said he played a prominent role during the same period in the united farm workers , the union founded by cesar chavez , but ms mikkelsen said those claims were greatly exaggerated the farm workers union did not return telephone calls yesterday in the early 1970 s , he moved to long island and organized the eastern farm workers association , and in 1972 , led the group in a strike against the im young company , a major potato processor when mr perenteramos died last year at age 59 , the new york times published an obituary focusing on his labor efforts , based largely on information provided by his associates after cult experts described his other activities , the times ran a corrective article including that information after the long island strike , he largely receded from public view , but over the years he drew the attention of law enforcement in 1984 , the fbi raided his carroll street headquarters , claiming it had evidence that the provisional party of communists , led by mr perenteramos , planned a series of violent acts but police officials said yesterday that none of the related groups was known to have a history of violence

albany , feb 27 the democraticcontrolled assembly issued subpoenas today to gov george e pataki s top economic adviser and a private lawyer , seeking information about the corporation that financed mr pataki s threeday inauguration last year senior democrats in the assembly maintained that the two men and other officials were hiding how they raised hundreds of thousands of dollars for the event the move touched off what is likely to be a lengthy battle between the republican administration and democratic legislators over the inauguration , an elaborate affair whose records have been kept secret by the governor s aides both houses of the legislature can issue subpoenas , but in recent decades they have seldom invoked this power the subpoenas drew an immediate denunciation today from pataki administration officials , who said they were considering asking a court to declare them void i think that there is a real question as to the authority of what they may and may not do , mr pataki said at a news conference this morning , declining to comment further but the assembly speaker , sheldon silver , said the public had a right to know the names of the people and corporations that donated money for the inauguration this is an extraordinary remedy , mr silver said but they have stonewalled every other attempt to acquire this information the governor s aides , with his assent , set up the private corporation just after his election in 1994 to raise money for the event so that no taxpayer dollars would have to be spent the aides said at the time that the corporation , new york inaugural '95 , would abide by state campaign contribution limits and disclose the names of all donors yet the corporation did neither according to interviews with some of the contributors , it let many companies give more than is allowed under state campaign laws , and then , in november , it announced that it would not release a list of donors or any accounting of its activities at the heart of the dispute is the question of who gave money to new york inaugural '95 and whether those people or groups wanted favorable treatment from the state government in exchange for their contributions the administration has denied any wrongdoing , but senior democrats have repeatedly called for the corporation s records to be made public , hoping to turn the inauguration into a political liability for the governor though legislative subpoenas are unusual , the assembly democrats have issued them on a few occasions since mr pataki took office in the most recent instance , the governor s top environmental official , michael d zagata , asked a state supreme court justice in albany to quash a subpoena issued by assemblyman richard l brodsky , a democrat from westchester county in a ruling earlier this month , the justice , thomas w keegan , upheld the subpoena , which sought documents related to a pollution settlement between the state and general electric justice keegan said the assembly had to be able to obtain information that it needed to fulfill its job of making laws it appeared that the assembly waited for the judge s decision before going forward with today s subpoenas in explaining those subpoenas , senior democrats said they required more information about the pataki inaugural to determine whether to pass laws regulating such events perhaps we should do what other states have done and put statutory language on the books to deal with these kinds of inaugural functions , said assemblyman thomas dinapoli , a democrat from nassau county who is chairman of the committee on governmental operations the inaugural corporation was dissolved in november , and mr pataki s aides say it raised about 600 , 000 but the democrats insist that the total was closer to 14 million the governor s aides have said that new york inaugural '95 is under no obligation to release its records because it is not a governmental or political group the democrats charge that the corporation served a fundamentally political purpose and should be subject to campaign finance laws last month , three assembly committees sent letters to more than a dozen pataki advisers and republican officials requesting documents relating to new york inaugural '95 none of the officials turned over any record or specific information , and as a result the assembly turned to the subpoenas though mr pataki expressed doubts about the legality of the subpoenas this morning , later in the afternoon , his spokeswoman , zenia mucha , said the governor would have no role in determining whether to challenge them in court she said the administration s view was that the subpoenas involved a private corporation , not state government she also said that the governor would not discuss the subpoenas with the two men who received them , even though one of them , charles a gargano , is now mr pataki s top economic adviser this is a decision that will be made independently by the officers of the corporation , she said he does not plan to speak to any of them the assembly issued the subpoenas to mr gargano and lawrence kalkstein , a private lawyer mr gargano was mr pataki s top fundraiser during the campaign and the chairman of a committee that organized inaugural events mr kalkstein was the corporation s lawyer the subpoena orders the men to testify at a hearing in the assembly on march 20 and bring along the records of new york inaugural '95 and a related corporation , new york transition '95 caroline quartararo , a spokeswoman for mr gargano , accused the assembly democrats of trying to smear mr gargano this is nothing more than partisan politics at its worst , she said it should have no place in government
philadelphia , sept 10 the canadians were offside , united states coach ron wilson said , and their winning goal should not have counted mike richter , the american goalie , said he saw the shot and played it well but the puck bounced off his arm and over the goal line the shot was n't even that good , steve yzerman said , who scored the goal in overtime to give canada a 43 victory over the united states in the first game of the championship round of the world cup tournament it went off the tip of my stick , yzerman said it was going wide but it did n't stay that way yzerman fired high from a sharp angle deep in the leftwing corner richter reached out and partly blocked the puck it hit his left wrist , fell to the ice and trickled over the goal line at 10 minutes 37 seconds of overtime i'm disappointed , said richter , the ranger veteran i did a lot right on that shot but it went in you lose a game on that one inch or whatever and you know those canadians give them an inch and they 'll take a kilometer they hold a onegametonone lead in the twoofthreegames championship round they can clinch the tournament title thursday night in montreal if the united states wins , it will force a third and deciding game on saturday night , also in montreal the defeat was the first in the tournament for the americans , who fell to 41 they had opened the tournament with a 53 victory over canada , their first ever at this level of play who knows how many meters rod brind'amour may have been offside as he , yzerman and theoren fleury carried the puck into the american zone before 18 , 577 excited fans in corestates center wilson said it was offside by about three feet the linesmen missed it wilson also said that canada s claude lemieux was in the crease when he scored in the last minute of the second period to tie the score at 22 but these are just excuses , wilson said we did n't play well enough and the canadians deserved to win we might have respected the opposition a little too much we got away from playing as a team we were a little too full of ourselves sometimes , you have to stick your hand in the fire and get burned canada raised its record to 51 with its second consecutive overtime victory last saturday night , fleury scored in the final minute of the second overtime to give canada a 32 victory over sweden in a semifinal despite wilson s complaints , there were good performances by several american players and a thrilling moment in the final seconds of regulation play , when the united states pulled richter for an extra attacker and scored the tying goal tying it was john leclair , who batted at a loose puck after canadian goalie curtis joseph had stopped a high shot by brian leetch defenseman eric desjardins of canada tried to tuck the puck under his goalie , but it stayed loose , and leclair got credit earlier , defenseman derian hatcher scored twice for the united states to erase a 10 canadian lead in addition to his goals , hatcher was one of the bigbody checkers for the united states , bumping into the most rugged canadians , including eric lindros and mark messier in one of the collisions , messier s helmet popped off his head but messier also played well for canada in addition to knocking the helmet from leetch s head with a swipe of his hand , messier set up lemieux s goal by bursting down the right boards , around mathieu schneider , and passing to the goal area richter did n't have his best game of the tournament when fleury beat him to make it 32 midway through the third period , he pulled richter from right to left and beat him on the glove side from a sharp angle effective for canada , particularly early , was lindros , who opened the scoring at 16 50 of the first period on a deflection and put three shots on richter in the first 20 minutes the game had no fights , but plenty of intense checking when someone suggested to canada s brendan shanahan that the game was n't as bruising as some expected , shanahan replied maybe you should be in my body right now it was a pretty grueling game it was very humid and i think both teams wore each other down rather than crashup derby , it was both teams leaning on each other photos us goaltender mike richter , left , and tony amonte watching canada s winning score at 10 37 of overtime \( reuters \) \( pg b11 \) mike richter losing his balance after making a save on canada s brendan shanahan last night in philadelphia \( reuters \) \( pg b15 \)

washington , sept 17 the commission on presidential debates announced today that it believed that ross perot had no realistic chance of winning the presidential election and that he would therefore not be invited to join president clinton and bob dole in this year s debates the perot campaign immediately protested , calling the decision a travesty and promising a lawsuit by the end of the week to try to overturn it the dole campaign welcomed the panel s decision , but aides to mr clinton , who have made no secret of their hope that mr perot s presence in debates would dilute mr dole s chances of making gains , said they would continue to insist that mr perot participate in at least one debate the bipartisan 10member panel , which has sponsored the presidential and vicepresidential debates in the last two national elections , invited mr perot to participate in the 1992 debates he received 19 percent of the vote that year after a campaign largely financed by his own money unlike in 1992 , he has agreed this year to accept 29 million in federal campaign money , but he is running in single digits in most polls the panel said a survey of political scientists and journalists turned up no one who believed that mr perot could win the election or carry even a single state it would not release the names of those surveyed the commission , which was set up in 1987 by the two major parties , can set the conditions for only the debates it sponsors the candidates are not obliged to accept its conditions , nor are they required to participate in any debates , although staying out could have a political cost frank j fahrenkopf , a commission cochairman and former chairman of the republican national committee , said that mr perot had met some of the commission s criteria for inclusion , like being on the ballot and having organizations in all 50 states , but that the commission was designed to provide the public with debates featuring only those candidates who might actually become president , not those with merely theoretical chances paul g kirk jr , the panel s other cochairman and a former democratic national committee chairman , said , participation is not extended to candidates because they might prove interesting or entertaining after today s decision was announced , the national director of the perot campaign , russell j verney , told reporters that the two parties want to protect themselves and do not want the american people to see a vigorous debate the decision is widely seen as a potential boost to mr dole , who is trailing the president by wide margins in voter preference polls with less than two months until election day senior dole aides had said that they wanted an opportunity to have their candidate face mr clinton oneonone to improve his standing and that mr perot s inclusion in the debates would be a distraction as for the perot camp s complaints , everyone agreed going in that the commission was going to set certain standards , mr dole s communications director , john buckley , said , and mr perot has not met the commission s threshold of viability as a candidate in phoenix today , mr dole said he was looking forward to debating the president oneonone mr clinton , for his part , campaigning in ypsilanti , mich , said of mr perot in 1992 i thought he made a valuable contribution soon after the commission announced its decision , clinton aides insisted that mr perot be included in at least one debate a senior white house aide who spoke on the condition of anonymity called the commission s decision extremely disappointing and said the clinton campaign might not accept its recommendations he would not elaborate the clinton aides proposed three debates of two hours each two debates would feature the presidential candidates and one would feature the vicepresidential candidates in addition to mr perot s presence in at least one debate , the aides said one debate should be in the townmeeting format , at which mr clinton has shown special skill they proposed oct 6 , 9 and 13 for the sessions mr dole s team today proposed three oneonone debates with mr clinton , each lasting 75 minutes , on oct 6 , 13 and 21 in explaining the commission s decision , mr kirk and mr fahrenkopf said the committee s members had relied heavily on a report by its fivemember advisory committee professor richard e neustadt of harvard university , the head of the advisory committee , and his four colleagues surveyed journalists and political scientists , seeking their views on mr perot s chances some journalists declined to participate in the survey , believing it inappropriate to play a role in who would be invited to the debates e j dionne , a political commentator for the washington post , was one of the two journalists who declined when professor neustadt called , i did not think it was right for me to play a role in this process and told him so , he said in an interview the other journalist who declined was david shribman , the washington bureau chief of the baltimore globe , who also told professor neustadt it would be inappropriate mr verney , the perot campaign coordinator , criticized the journalists who participated in the process , saying many of them were as committed to the status quo as the two major parties in his report to the panel , professor neustadt , who has written many books on american government , said , we have concluded that at this stage of the campaign , mr perot has no realistic chance either of popular election in november or of subsequent election by the house of representatives in the event no candidate obtains an electoral college majority none of the expert observers we have consulted thinks otherwise while no political consultants currently employed by the dole or clinton campaigns participated in the survey , mr verney said that political consultants , by their very nature , depended on the two major parties for their livelihood mr kirk , the commission cochairman , said the decision to include mr perot four years ago had occurred under unusual circumstances even with a boost from the debate , mr kirk noted , mr perot garnered only 19 percent of the popular vote in hindsight , he said , mr perot did not have a realistic chance to be elected that year paradoxically , mr kirk said , mr perot s acceptance of federal money this year worked against him in accepting it , mr perot was barred from tapping his personal fortune as he did in 1992 instead , his personal contribution to his campaign is limited to 50 , 000 at a result , the cochairman said , mr perot s ability to spread his message has been effectively undercut

washington , may 8 temporarily out of money , bob dole thinks he has found a winning issue , one that can help him emerge from a perilous slump riding high , bill clinton thinks he has found one that can help cement his lead and so gridlock is back on capitol hill , and with it the prospect of renewed public disenchantment as president clinton and his allbutcertain republican opponent fought a partisan duel today over the minimum wage and the gasoline tax , they tried hard not to sound petulant , but they did the one thing that voters constantly complain about they blamed it all on the other guy each called on the other to set politics aside , but neither one did both knew before they spoke that it would never happen , not in an election year it reminds me , said a prominent wall street executive who knows washington well , of a marriage where two people married beneath each other therein lies the danger for senator dole if that kind of disgust is registered by the public at large , it is hard to see how he can benefit he is seeking to deny a sitting president a second term , which requires the challenger to draw sharp distinctions between himself and the incumbent voters fed up with both parties are not likely to rise up and cast out a president given no reason to do otherwise , they will go with the flow a 43centagallon cut in the gasoline tax , even as a symbol for a much larger issue , seems too marginal an issue , at least by itself it pales next to questions like watergate , the vietnam war , the iranian hostages all of which have played large parts in the ousters of recent presidents but mr dole s strategists think the country is more conservative than mr clinton the president s big lead , they argue , results from mr clinton s deft \( and , they think , insincere \) espousal of republican policies typically , this week , he signed a republican bill for tax relief for those who adopt children , suggesting that he is as eager as any republican to reduce the number of abortions so mr dole has been searching since the end of the primaries for an issue that would enable him to portray mr clinton as a taxandspend liberal precisely the image the president does not want to project the increase in gasoline costs presented mr dole with the opening he sought mr clinton had increased gasoline taxes mr dole would call for the repeal of that increase , which was sure to hit a chord in a country that considers cheap gasoline part of its birthright when taxes have topped the political agenda in the last 30 years , the republicans have usually won they own the issue , the way the democrats own medicare and medicaid and social security finally , said one of mr dole s senate allies today , we get the chance to fight on our ground mr clinton saw the trap and let it be known that he would sign a repeal if it came to his desk unencumbered by what he called poison pills but if the republicans and mr dole are to get the bulk of the credit for cutting an unpopular tax unpopular even though it has relatively little to do with the recent price increase then the democrats and mr clinton want countervailing credit for something else that is equally popular an increase in the minimum wage , for which they have been pressing in vain for months in the end , something will no doubt be worked out the senate is not going to sit here , stuck , until the conventions have come and gone and the world series is approaching but for a while , it suits both sides to have the chance to score political points , the democrats portraying the republicans as foes of working people , the republicans portraying the democrats as champions of big government , and each portraying the other as obdurate and obstructionist mr dole has made no effort to conceal the fact that this is a political enterprise he stood before the cameras outside the internal revenue service on tuesday to make his points on taxes the republicans began broadcasting new campaign commercials that urged mr clinton to support senator dole s plan to repeal your gas tax , and learn that actions do speak louder than words and governors william f weld of massachusetts and stephen merrill of new hampshire , the latter an important dole campaign aide , both chimed in with plans to cut the gasoline taxes in their states oil executives , among others , insist a rollback of the tax increase will not be reflected at the pump that wo n't happen , said mike bowlin , the chairman of arco , on the abc news program nightline maybe not but from the republican viewpoint , even a secondary issue is better than none spirits in the dole camp have been visibly lifted by his move onto the offensive , at a moment when defeatism was becoming a threat , with mr clinton leading mr dole almost 2 to 1 \( 64 percent to 33 percent \) in the latest harris poll
fighting over a legacy the joseph cornell foundation has been busy parceling out its legacy , much to the consternation of the new york state attorney general s office since 1994 , the attorney general s staff has been pursuing a lawsuit against the foundation , saying that it has failed to fulfill the philanthropic wishes of cornell , the artist , who died in 1972 the foundation recently offered gifts of cornell s famous collages and boxes to seven american museums the seattle art museum , the museum of modern art in san francisco , the philadelphia museum of art , the virginia museum of fine arts in richmond , the wadsworth atheneum in hartford , the st louis museum of art and the museum of contemporary art in los angeles richard m ader , the artist s lawyer and one of the foundation s two trustees , said most of the museums had not yet accepted the gifts one that has , however , the museum of contemporary art in los angeles , has been given 6 boxes and 15 collages , worth just under 1 million when officials at the museum heard about the lawsuit , they issued a written statement yesterday saying the museum was unaware of the pending legal suit against the cornell foundation regarding distribution of the artist s works moca intends to investigate this matter and take the appropriate action in 1994 , the foundation gave 7 million worth of art to 16 museums across the country but in july of that year , g oliver koppell , who was then state attorney general , filed the lawsuit , which is still in litigation the suit noted that in his will , cornell left specific instructions that none of my works of art be given by my trustees to museums the will directed that such works of art wherever possible be sold either to such institutions directly or to private persons we have been selling art all along over the years , mr ader said this week but museums are not great purchasers of art they expect works to be given what we wanted is what every artist wants , for his art to be seen in museums all over the country making these donations seemed to make the most sense charitable trusts like the cornell foundation are obliged under federal law to give at least 5 percent of their assets each year to charities the foundation , however , has given away art , not cash , and has amassed a substantial investment portfolio court papers state that this strategy has benefited its two trustees , who under state law are paid an annual fee equal to 6 percent of the foundation s income the other trustee is donald windham , a longtime friend of cornell the foundation has made only one cash contribution since its founding 1 , 000 to the council for vailleavitt music hall , in riverhead , li things of value , whether they be cash , gold , ibm stock or art , are still things of value , mr ader said i do n't see what the difference is mr ader s lawyer , joseph erdman , said yesterday , there are constructive discussions going on between the foundation and the attorney general s office with a view to resolving all outstanding differences vowing to stay in soho everyone has heard a different version of the story about the fate of 420 west broadway in soho since leo castelli , ileana sonnabend and charles cowles set up galleries there 25 years ago , the building has played a pivotal role in soho and in contemporary art so rumors that the 1890 s fivestory structure near spring street had been sold to a developer and would be transformed into a minidepartment store set tongues wagging here s what s really going on the building s owners mr castelli , ms sonnabend , mr cowles , wouter germans and fritz van eck have been running it as a cooperative since buying it in 1971 as more retail stores have filled soho and some art galleries have left for 57th street , chelsea and the upper east side , the art dealers realized they were sitting on a plum piece of real estate but mr castelli , who just turned 89 , said this week that the building was not being sold and that he had no intention of closing his gallery all the rumors are untrue , mr castelli said if the other owners want to sell the building , they ca n't nothing can or will happen unless i give my consent things will go on as usual several of his coowners , however , confirmed that a european developer had made an offer on the building last summer yes , there are lots of rumors , mr cowles said yes , there s been action but nothing s signed we 've all planned our shows though the season in fact , i'm arranging my spring schedule right now at the sonnabend gallery , antonio homem , its director , said , we are pleased to be where we are , and our only plans are to stay while chelsea beckons meanwhile the migration of galleries from soho to chelsea continues lisa spellman , owner of gallery 303 , which has been on greene street for eight years , will open in late november at 525 west 22d street the atmosphere in soho is a bit like reading a great book with the tv on , she said there s too much going on i ca n't concentrate in chelsea , i 'll have beautiful groundfloor space after two and a half years on lafayette street , bill maynes is moving to the eighth floor of a building at 529535 west 20th street the price was right , he said i like the whole idea of what s going on there he , too , plans to open in november mr maynes will have a familiar neighbor upstairs after two years of dealing privately , stefan stux will open a gallery in the same building , on the ninth floor when i closed my mercer street gallery exactly two years ago , i said i would return , he said and i have not everyone moving to chelsea is from soho paolo baldacci , who for five years had a gallery in the fuller building , at 41 east 57th street , is opening two spaces in chelsea one , at 521 west 23d street , is a place he has owned for several years and used for parties now it will become a gallery for modern art , and his newest space , two blocks away , at 521 west 21st street , will show his contemporary artists the work of our contemporary artists like james hyde , archie rand and alan uglow required a larger space , said neal guma , the gallery s director having good neighbors helps \( the contemporary space is right across the street from paula cooper s new gallery \) dealers and auction houses if auction houses are n't in direct cahoots with art dealers these days , they are at least indirectly involved in june , for example , sotheby s announced that andre emmerich , the 57th street dealer , and his staff would join the auction house to operate a division called emmerich sotheby s now spink son , the london gallery specializing in oriental art as well as british paintings , has paid 33 million for leger galleries , a gallery on bond street that deals in british paintings , watercolors and drawings but remember that spink is owned by christie s , which acquired the king street gallery for about 109 million three years ago our picture division will be renamed spinkleger , said timothy hirsch , managing director of spink we have a different clientele and have always yearned to have a

rajin , north korea , sept 16 if people are starving in north korea , it is difficult to detect in this remote northeast part of the country , far from the area where floods have ravaged crops for two years in a row nor is there any outward sign of the political divisions that are rumored to lurk under the surface of the world s most closed society but what was evident to foreigners attending a conference last weekend aimed at attracting investors to a freetrade zone being set up here was a deadening oppression and economic stagnation this town and neighboring sonbong are strangely lethargic , with none of the hustle and bustle found in other asian countries my first reaction was to the silence , the absolute silence , said a european businessman who attended the conference even in china and vietnam , even under socialist regimes , there are always people shouting , swearing , laughing but here people do n't say a thing the threeday governmentsponsored conference gave foreigners a rare glimpse into north korean life but the view was so restricted that it shed little light on such mysteries as the extent of the food supply and the stability of the government the two towns had clearly been spruced up for visitors buildings were freshly painted and potholes newly filled people here cannot speak freely any foreigner leaving the conference site was followed by security agents because no fewer than five security agents were listening intently , it was impossible to judge whether han bon soon , 41 , a worker in a military factory encountered outside his house , was telling the truth when he told a foreign visitor that he ate 700 grams or 15 pounds of rice a day and that his food consumption had not declined in the last few years united nations food organizations say some north koreans are eating as little as 250 grams of rice a day , or a little more than half a pound , barely enough for subsistence it s true that there has been difficulty with food because of the floods recently , mr han said , but because of the great leader we can get food from abroad the great leader used to refer to kim il sung , the dictator who died in 1994 , but it may now mean his son , kim jong il one of the riddles of north korean politics is whether the son , long known as the dear leader , has fully inherited his father s powers signs of a cowed society were abundant even though this was no doubt the first time that many people here had seen a foreigner , they displayed no outward curiosity and generally ignored the visitors while children in other countries might stare at or gather around a foreigner , here they scampered away to hide when two visitors entered the rajin train station , everyone inside quickly retreated to the far corner of the room rajin and sonbong have some tens of thousands of people each they are about nine miles apart , with wide streets , mainly dirt but some paved no beggars or homeless people were visible there were virtually no cars except for those here for the conference and , as in other parts of north korea , no swarms of bicycles like those found in other asian countries people walk the port of rajin , the railroad to nearby china and some public buildings were built by japanese occupiers in the 1930 s some japanese who lived here as children until the end of world war ii returned last weekend in a tour group and were struck by how little the place had changed it looks like the town has been asleep for 51 years , said hiroshi oishi , an english teacher from fukuoka , japan , who was in the tour group many people live in standardized sixstory concrete apartments with balconies behind them are wooden sheds for storage the white singlestory houses with their wooden chimneys are more picturesque the houses are behind identical fences painted white and tan many people have yards in which they have planted bean vines and cabbage and other food that they are allowed to keep for their own use one house shown to foreign visitors by security agents consisted of two small rooms with a cavity in the floor for burning wood or coal for heating and cooking it had hard floors , some cabinets , a desk , a television and the obligatory portraits of kim il sung and kim jong il on the wall but when mr han , the factory worker , was asked if he would allow a visitor to see his home , a security agent immediately went to look inside without mr han s permission , came back and indicated that a visit would not be allowed at the forum , ideology was kept to a minimum so as not to deter investors but in the streets it is still evident because kim il sung , who ruled the country with an iron hand for nearly five decades , was portrayed here more as a god than a man , his death does not seem to have affected the adulation accorded him signs have gone up proclaiming , the great leader kim il sung is with us forever uniformed children from an elementary school march through the streets singing songs in praise of him and his son this area does show the impact of the decline of trade with the former soviet union , which was the main provider of economic aid and fuel to north korea until it collapsed a few years ago an oil refinery built by the soviet union to process oil from siberia now sits silent marcus noland , an economist from the institute for international economics in washington , asked if he might see some garment factories that were listed as optional tours for those attending the forum he was told that none were operating but three of the plants were pressed into operation for his visit , and mr noland was shocked by what he saw i was ready to buy the equipment , ship it back to the united states and sell them as antiques , he said the 200 , 000kilowatt electric power plant , one of the country s biggest , was built in the early 1970 s using czech and russian equipment steam can be seen leaking out of pipes , and the plant is so thunderously noisy that park dok hwa , the chief engineer , apologized to visitors before leading them inside sonbong is the arrival port for the heavy fuel oil that is being supplied by the united states and other countries under a 1994 agreement to compensate north korea for stopping its suspected nuclear weapons program this fuel oil now accounts for more than half of the oil used at the power plant photo in

earthworms may be considered the lowliest of all creatures , but many admire them and for good reason fishermen in search of bait probably rate somewhere near the top of the admiration list biology teachers use them in classrooms and , of course , robins relish them for lunch some entrepreneurs make a business of raising and selling earthworms gardeners in search of better soil are right up there on the admiration list too aristotle said that the earthworms were the intestines of the soil cleopatra was so impressed with the earthworm s attributes that she declared the creature sacred perhaps the greatest admirer of all , however , was none other than charles darwin who spent nearly 40 years studying them he equated the earthworm with a plow , and once wrote it may be doubted whether there are many other animals which have played so important a part in the history of the world as these lowly creatures there are many kinds of earthworms they differ not only in size , but in genetic makeup and species one source says there are about 1 , 800 species another says there are 3 , 000 the most common earthworms known in europe and north america have somewhere around 220 species any way you count it , there is plenty of variety among earthworms worldwide paleontologists have learned that the modern earthworms were preceded by marine worms it was not until the seas receded enough to allow dry areas and vegetation to appear onshore that the worms were able to leave their wet world and start demonstrating their soilbuilding attributes these critters , tapered at either end , have no eyes and no protruding appendages such as ears they are hermaphroditic that is , each has both male and female sexual apparatus but they do need another worm to copulate their burrowing technique , described by jerry minnich in the earthworm book , is what it is all about for gardeners earthworms move through the soil in one of two ways by pushing aside the soil or eating through it in loose and light soil , the worm will usually push aside the soil , both by using its prostomium \( the mouth flap \) and by contracting the circular and longitudinal muscles of the body wall in this process , earthworms aerate the soil and reduce compaction their castings , after soil has passed through their digestive systems , are high in nutrient content as a result the soil they frequent tends to be loosened , easy to work and extremely fertile anyone who has a compost pile knows well how these silent wonder workers contentedly make a home for themselves while greatly enhancing the compost s organic content part of any earthworm s meal is nematodes , both the good and bad ones when there is a high population of the harmful nematodes available , these earth movers can gobble them up perhaps this praise for the lowly creatures will encourage gardeners to take more care of them the earthworms carry on their work unseen , for the most part it is not until a spade or trowel reveals them that their presence is known then , it can be fascinating to watch how very quickly they scurry for cover and no wonder they do for one thing , if earthworms are exposed to the hot sun , they can succumb very quickly in as few as 60 seconds , exposure to ultraviolet rays could kill an earthworm they need a quick coverover if exposed also , during drenching rains , earthworms are often seen , vulnerable , on the surface of the soil or in gutters and streets worst of all , perhaps , children sometimes cut earthworms in two thinking they are multiplying the population wrong they are most likely killing them , as regeneration is a sometime thing now there is word of a new and deadly threat to the welcome earthworm a recent article in the american gardener , published by the american horticultural society , tells of an invasion of flatworms in the british isles this killer was introduced accidentally from new zealand and first discovered in northern ireland in the 1960 s it has since been found in scotland and parts of england the flatworm has a rather sinister appearance , according to the article , and it gives earthworms chase after cornering its victim , the article states , the flatworm coils itself around the earthworm and releases mucuslike digestive enzymes that dissolve the earthworm s tissues the killer worm has been contained , so far , and there is constant vigil that it does not spread any further this is just another instanceof why it is so important to guard our nation from unwanted imports import certificates for plant material and inspections at ports of entry may seem to be evidence of bureaucratic waste but they s are essential to guard the nation s agricultural integrity drawing
few kinds of photography have fallen into such disrepute as portraiture where once ambitious portrait photographers could hope to capture a true expression of an individual s character , these days even the best photographers , faced with the task of depicting a subject , seem reduced to confessions of impotence can a portrait do more than record the mask a person presents to the world \? the answer offered by thomas ruff , a german photographer whose recent work is at the 303 gallery in soho , is a resounding , no in the late 1980 s mr ruff achieved a flurry of artworld attention with a series of color portraits of his fellow art students as images , the photos were notable chiefly for the resolutely deadpan expressions with which the students confronted the camera photographed as if for driving licenses , the sitters betrayed no emotion or even interest in the proceedings any sense of personal differences , let alone of interior lives , was obliterated by the resolute frontality and insistent clarity in these brightly lighted images , there was no place for personalities or other nebulous traits what gave these determinedly cool images a surprising charge was their size blown up to wallsize proportions , the photographs looked like gigantic banners of eastern european dictators in each of his new pictures mr ruff combines two of his earlier portraits into one double exposure , using an oldfashioned camera designed for that purpose the results are small , ghostly blackandwhite prints with none of the commanding physical presence of the huge color works what they lack in sheer impact , however , is more than made up for by their strangeness , and the many questions they suggest in each image , the two portraits fit together more or less smoothly , creating chimeras in which personalities form compatible or conflicting pairings figuring out how the images go together is like trying to decide which parent a baby most resembles as in life , one or the other face often dominates in one work , the combined portrait takes on one sitter s angry scowl another exudes a good health and wholesomeness that clearly comes more from one image than the other a few of the pairings are startlingly ambiguous , particularly as to sex a heavy masculine head appears on a slender , feminine neck a woman s small mouth outlined in lipstick is matched with a man s squarejawed face combining photographs is nothing new in the 19th century , sir francis galton and other scientists used composite photographs to support theories about racial and social types a dozen or more photographs would be combined to produce a portrait of a generic businessman or criminal but those images were fuzzy and vague , and served chiefly to provide a cloak of photographic authority for prejudices dressed up as science more recent artists , usually with tongues planted firmly in cheeks , have also produced composites in one notable series , nancy burson used a computer to combine photos of hollywood heart throbs , male and female , into putative romantic ideals computers allow artists to transform faces in many ways the technique of morphing , where one figure or face flows smoothly into another very different one , has created astonishing scifi effects and memorable video music clips and shavingcream commercials what makes mr ruff s composites interesting is their dumbness not only is his technique simple , with no more than two figures joined in an image , but the photographs he uses were inexpressive to begin with combining them might seem like multiplying zero times zero but some of the merged pictures actually suggest individuals more strongly than the original photographs did it s as if traces of personalities lurking in the portraits are uncovered in the seams of the combination prints not that the resulting creatures are attractive , or even look much like real people a female face appears with a heavy mustache a figure s forehead is broadened and its mouth smeared , creating an android one would hate to meet on a dark street in the end mr ruff s photographs confirm the magnetic appeal of faces , and the enigmatic clues they seem to offer about the people behind them that the clues are illusory is a large part of the pictures' appeal in an essay on clothes , montaigne wrote of a beggar who on a cold night was scolded by a gentleman for being dressed in nothing but rags but you , sir , have your face exposed , the beggar replied well , i am all face ruff s people , too , are all face , and fascinating because of it thomas ruff s photographs remain at the 303 gallery , 89 greene street \( near spring street \) , in soho through march 9 photo anderes portrat no 109 122 , by thomas ruff , at 303 gallery \( 303 gallery \)

bronx spaces at the bronx museum of the arts gathers under one roof in spirit , if not exactly in fact four of the borough s hardworking nonprofit alternative art spaces the bronx river art center and gallery , en foco , lehman college art gallery and longwood arts project alternative to what \? one might ask , and the answer is fairly simple to the predominantly white , academically inclined gallery system that was firmly entrenched in manhattan in the 1970 s and 80 s when these galleries first opened their doors thanks in part to them and to places like them , the new york art world looks different today , with a much broader demographic base and a more inclusive spectrum of styles and ideas still , we are n't talking revolution all four of these organizations continue to draw mostly local traffic \( as does the bronx museum itself , which was established in 1971 \) and the quality of work is as hitandmiss as that found in soho on any given day but it s the mix that matters , and bronx spaces is a generous combination platter of a show its participating institutions have each been allotted separate floor space and have been invited to choose artists whom they feel best represent their respective exhibition track records of the four , lehman college art gallery , housed on a campus of the city university of new york , has the clearest link to the commercial mainstream most of the artists selected by its director , susan hoeltzel , are familiar from manhattan galleries a polished and eclectic group , their works range from robert blackburn s abstract prints , to rigoberto torres s wonderful sculpture of the puerto rican singer ruth fernandez , to douglas davis s world wide web site , host to the world s first collaborative sentence \( http math240lehmancunyedu art \) also strong , and with a firmer grassroots base , is the work chosen by betty wilde , curator of en foco , a gallery that organizes photographic exhibitions in public sites throughout the bronx among the standouts are four glowing largescale blackand white portraits of hispanic residents by sophie rivera , part of a series \( commissioned by the metropolitan transit authority \) that once graced the 161st street subway station images by corky lee of new york s chinese workingclass community are both harsh and poetic , and the same is true of jonathan martin rosen s cityscapes of junkfilled lots bathed in an otherwordly light the work offered by the longwood arts project , the exhibition space of the bronx council on the arts , is , by contrast , uneven the gallery s director , bettisue hertz , has brought three installation pieces that seem to want to say a lot , but that none of which conjure the atmospheric density to which this medium is suited the best of the three , esperanza cortes s wedding suite , with its strings of fleshcolored roses and its sacrificial altar of a bed , makes a cogent if oddly antiseptic statement about sexual servitude but michael bramwell s prosaic assemblage of shelving and velvet curtains comes nowhere near suggesting the formal sacred place described in the show s catalogue , and todd ayoung s mixedmedia colonialist critique using mirrors and arthistory texts is little more than a wellintentioned hash the selection by amir bey , the curator at the bronx river art center and gallery , also has its problems marilyn nance s photonarrative , in which religious jubilation and political anger are all but indistinguishable , is good but the draftsmanly figures in joe wippler s bodega series paintings are sabotaged by his addition of clunky sheetmetal awnings and juan sanchez s wallfilling blessings for puerto rican political prisoners is content to make too easy shorthand references to its dynamic subject rather than to bring it to life this piece , in fact , like the exhibition itself , prompts some basic questions about the role of alternative spaces should they be designed to delve deep into the culture of a given community to remain deliberately , even defiantly parochial or should they serve as a bridge from that community to the larger world \? ideally , the answer is both , though the balance is hard to strike a painting titled amerika , by tim rollins and kos in the longwood section , incorporates passages in english from franz kafka that are unlikely to mean much to anyone unfamiliar with that writer s work \( and , indeed , this collaborative group had its greatest success in soho \) mr sanchez s memorial piece , on the other hand , will probably leave out in the cold viewers who know little about the specific history he is addressing what s important , though , is that , thanks to the venues that inspired and supported them , these very different works were created in the same community and , at least for the duration of this show , are being exhibited side by side such juxtapositions are what give bronx spaces its energy whatever the merits of the individual works , together they suggest that it is increasingly possible to see the art world as a microcosm of american society at large , and that is something to be optimistic about the friends and neighbors portrayed in ms rivera s photographic subway installation , outgoing or circumspect , dressed up or dressed down , are now the art world , too , both as subject and audience maybe urban renewal is truly under way bronx spaces remains at the bronx museum of the arts , 1040 grand concourse , at 165th street , morrisania , the bronx , through june 23 photo rigoberto torres s sculpture of the puerto rican singer ruthfernandez , at the bronx museum of the arts \( bronx museum of the arts \)

daytona beach , fla , oct 23 in the continuing battle for the nation s fourthlargest state , president clinton touted his welfare policies in this conservative region of florida today , a morning after wooing cubanamericans at a latenight visit to miami s little havana on a glorious sunny day , with american flags and palm trees whipping in a breeze and a green and orange sign behind him proclaiming welfare to work , a new beginning , mr clinton promoted his signing of a republicanoriginated bill that sets stringent time limits on welfare benefits i ran for office in 1992 , mr clinton said , and i told you here in daytona that i would work to end welfare as we know it and to convert it to a system that promotes independence , good parenting , and successful work and that s exactly what we 're doing when he announced this past summer that he would sign the welfare measure , mr clinton called the bill flawed and said he particularly objected to provisions limiting assistance to legal immigrants and to restrictions on food stamps but at the rally today the president mentioned none of his reservations he described the law as one that says the national government will continue to guarantee to poor families health care and food for the children and if they go to work more for child care than ever the president also pointed to a report released today by the health and human services department showing that more than 1 billion in delinquent child support payments was withheld from federal income tax refunds in 1995 we 're going to keep going until we raise child support more and more and more , he said , noting that this money was coming from parents , not from the taxpayers mr clinton narrowly lost florida in 1992 and , according to public opinion polls , he and bob dole are in a dead heat the state has been saturated with millions of dollars in campaign advertisements , and douglas sosnik , the white house political director , said he expected the clinton television advertising to continue he said the president would probably return to florida before the election florida last supported a democratic presidential candidate in 1976 , and mr clinton s presence here so close to election day illustrates how far he is reaching into states normally considered a secure part of the republican base in fact , mr clinton will finish out this week not in the normal battleground states of the industrial midwest but in alabama , louisiana and georgia mr clinton s aides believe several factors have made the president competitive here the democrats have been able to make inroads into florida s large population of retirees by capitalizing on the republican budget plan last year to slow the growth of medicare spending by 270 billion over seven years in addition , the democrats say republican positions on immigration and in favor of english as the nation s official language have hurt in the traditionally republican cubanamerican community a recent miami herald poll found that 41 percent of florida s cubanamericans plan to vote for mr clinton , compared with 58 percent for mr dole that is double what mr clinton won in 1992 , and mr sosnik said it was generally believed that mr clinton could win the state if he held on to 30 percent of the cuban vote late tuesday night after appearing at fundraising events that collected 2 million for florida democrats mr clinton turned up at the versailles , a cuban restaurant in the heart of little havana , to eat dessert with 20 prominent cubanamericans outside the restaurant clinton and dole supporters waged a shouting match , one group shouting viva dole and the other countering dole no , clinton si earlier that day , the treasury department announced that it was granting special licenses to allow direct flights to cuba to bring aid to victims of hurricane lili tonight , mr clinton returned to washington for the third major fundraising event in a week , bringing the total to an expected 15 million , primarily for democratic congressional candidates photo president clinton was greeted yesterday by wellwishers in daytona beach , fla , left , while his running mate , vice president al gore , campaigned in duluth , minn mr gore blamed the republicans for past economic problems and said the clinton administration was making progress \( james estrin the new york times \)
under the facade of a handsome tudor building , across a wide expanse of lawn flecked with the yellows and reds of fallen leaves , a group of young men enjoy some time away from their books as they practice kicking , dribbling and shooting soccer balls into a net a familiar autumnal image of a connecticut campus , perhaps , yet one that would have been unimaginable only a few years ago in the 1980 s , st basil college in stamford had the smallest student body of any college in the state enrollments consisted at times of only a halfdozen students there was even a year when the entire graduating class could be counted on one finger back then , the threat of losing state accreditation seemed very real forget soccer this college s students would have had a hard time getting up a doubles match yet st basil kept operating , because it had to it was the only seminary for ukrainian catholic priests in the united states the fact that their branch of catholicism , with byzantine rather than roman roots , was being suppressed in its homeland by a communist government gave the college something to live for nevertheless , it appeared st basil might soon close , as had many other catholic seminaries in recent years today st basil college has more students than it has seen in years 51 , and expected to rise steadily in the years to come by 1999 , if all goes according to plan , the college will have a hundred students for the first time ever the reason is one of the most ambitious foreign study programs at an american college nearly all of st basil s student population is from ukraine they are united by what they call a common goal to become priests back home in a land where such a calling was banned by law only a few years ago the program is described by its administrators as a classic case of christian reciprocity a native church that sent priests to america in the late 1800 s to minister to ukrainian immigrants is now receiving help from the descendants of those it once looked after it was time to give a gift back , a hundred years later , said msgr john terlecky , vice chairman of the school s board of trustees the program began in the fall of 1994 st basil s rector , the rev edward p young said there is a severe need for seminaries to educate the crop of wouldbepriests in ukraine that emerged with the collapse of the soviet union enrollment is overflowing , he said of the situation there seminaries are stuffed to the gills there is no room monsignor terlecky , who journeyed to ukraine immediately after the fall of the soviet union , recalled newly created seminaries there with more than 300 beginning students and no program to speak of here we were , who had prayed for years for the lord of the harvest to send laborers into the harvest , he said now they were showing up , and we had no place to put them in contrast , st basil college was a seminary with a program but no students established in 1939 when growing turmoil in ukraine made the education of american priests there less feasible , st basil is on the former campus of a girls' boarding school , glen eden academy , which had closed during the depression enrollment had begun to decline in the late 1960 s , and by the 1980 s was down to a trickle as the soviet union faltered , bishop basil h losten had kept the seminary s state certification active during a threeyear period when it no longer offered a full college program , only housing and some specialized courses in ukrainian catholicism bishop losten one of four ukrainian catholic diocesan bishops in the united states whose parish of new england and new york state includes st basil said he did this with an eye toward the changes in the east when communism fell , those kids in the ukraine were going to need a place to study , he said since the motherland had helped us in times of immigration , i thought we could reciprocate in some way while the students will have to return to ukraine for four more years of studies before completing their training , bishop losten said at st basil they get a core understanding of humanities and philosophy unavailable in their homeland , as well as a firsthand view of the west over there , you learn what they tell you to learn , bishop losten said you 're not expected to learn for yourself it s still a communistic system here , they learn to think and make decisions it is a stark contrast from the life they knew only a short time before sister sheila campbell , a roman catholic nun who teaches english to firstyear arrivals , recalled meeting her first ukrainian class in 1994 when i walked in the door , they jumped up and stood at their desks , she said i nearly died the students , most of them still in their late teens , spend their first year completely immersed in learning english before beginning a fouryear liberal arts college program courses include biology and psychology as well as greek and latin english , not ukrainian , is the main language spoken there is even a new computer center on campus
washington , may 29 a new poll casts doubt on the conventional wisdom that people who do not vote are more alienated about the state of american politics than those who do the survey , to be released here on thursday by the league of women voters , found that nonvoters are no more alienated than voters it concluded that people do not vote because they do not grasp the importance of elections on issues that matter to them , that they are ill informed about their choices and that they perceive the actual process of voting as difficult and cumbersome the single most widely cited explanation for lack of voter participation is rising political alienation , said mark mellman , a democratic pollster whose company conducted the survey with a republican polling concern , withlin worldwide but the evidence in this study demonstrates very clearly that political alienation is completely unrelated to political participation there have been few comprehensive surveys of nonvoters , and these findings offer a deeper understanding of the behavior of people who choose not to participate one explanation for not voting is that many people do not see it as particularly important asked what they would do , given a choice between voting and taking advantage of a onceayear sale at a favorite store , 30 percent of nonvoters chose the sale , compared with 6 percent of voters asked to choose between watching a new episode of a favorite television program or voting , 27 percent of nonvoters said they would stay home for the program only 3 percent voters would stay home the poll of 600 voters and 600 nonvoters nationwide was conducted by telephone from march 13 to march 20 voters were defined as respondents who are currently registered to vote and who voted in either the 1992 presidential election or the 1994 midterm elections nonvoters were classified as those who did not vote in 1992 or 1994 the margin of sampling error was plus or minus four percentage points the poll found that voters and nonvoters were equally mistrustful of government among nonvoters , 72 percent said they could trust the federal government to do what was right only some of the time or never among voters , the figure was 73 percent asked if government is run by a few big interests or for the benefit of all people , 69 percent of voters and 73 percent of nonvoters replied , a few big interests despite those similar responses , people who vote were more likely to believe that elections make a difference sixtytwo percent of voters said the 1996 presidential election would make a great deal of difference , while only 50 percent of nonvoters said that the nonvoters were also far less inclined to believe that their own participation would make a difference fortyfive percent of nonvoters said their vote would matter not too much or none at all to the outcome of an election , while 24 percent of the voters had the same response in addition , voters were far more likely than nonvoters to perceive significant differences between the democrats and republicans on issues like jobs and economic security , taxes , the deficit , social security and medicare the survey also suggested that voter mobilization efforts are important in getting people to the polls seventynine percent of voters said they were contacted in the last four years by a candidate s campaign , compared with only 42 percent of nonvoters and 75 percent of voters said they had some contact from political parties , compared with 44 percent of nonvoters
chicago welcome to planet rodman , where power forwards dress in drag and muscle goliath , pump serious iron and outsmart eggheads welcome to a place where book writer and bike rider wear rouge and rebound , to a developing story about a man who is infatuated with rings , from the championship kind to those that decorate the navel a man who seems to have it both ways , becoming more of a mainstream icon the more bizarre he tries to be more and more , like it or not , the chicago bulls' playoff spring has become a story in large part being written by the calculated madness of dennis rodman , no 1 on the glass and the new york times bestseller list it s his book party , and he 'll rebound if he wants to against the orlando magic here yesterday , rodman made nolook passes inside the paint he outrebounded the magic \( 76 \) on the offensive boards he converted two of them with balletic onehanded stuffs he got 21 rebounds in 32 minutes he scored 13 points and manhandled a man the size of a mountain and he reminded scottie pippen to not , under any circumstances , help out when he s guarding shaquille o'neal pippen made this mistake during the third quarter of the bulls' 12183 victory , a distressingly lopsided rout that may , if fans are lucky , be one of those early aberrations that foretell nothing but not unless the magic does something about rodman at the time pippen had the audacity to think that rodman was imperiled in the post , the game was still competitive , the bulls holding a 6351 , thirdquarter lead luc longley , hackashaqer no 1 , had four fouls and a seat on the bench bulls coach phil jackson , throwing all kinds of wrinkles at his magic counterpart brian hill , went to rodman on o'neal , a tactic that had worked for a couple of firsthalf possessions anfernee hardaway , the one representative of the magic kingdom who did n't show up in a goofy suit , lobbed a pass to o'neal pippen skipped a couple of steps toward the big man , who was being guarded from behind by rodman a good passer out of the doubleteam , o'neal sent the ball right back to hardaway , who spotted up and hit the 3pointer the bulls , their lead suddenly 9 , called time rodman , hands on hips , stared at pippen , then at the ceiling , and , finally , was coaxed off the floor by michael jordan dennis , explained john salley , the bulls' reserve center and rodman s old detroit running mate , prides himself on locking guys up by himself and whoever he guards , he usually locks up salley mentioned larry bird patrick ewing james worthy sweet memories of the pistons' playoff past pippen , perhaps remembering being knocked nearly unconscious by bad boy rodman some years ago , proceeded to mind his own business and rodman held o'neal to one measly field goal over the next 5 minutes 55 seconds absolutely unable to back rodman in , o'neal missed four shots and turned the ball over twice the bulls finished the quarter with an 185 rush , and that was that dennis was the one guy who i knew i could throw out against o'neal to fight for position in the post , jackson reasoned he has tremendous leg strength and has a good base under him , even though he gives up a lot of weight ninetythree pounds , to be exact and 4 inches no big handicap on planet rodman did we mention yet that rodman played the game with a stomach virus \? a mere earthly problem i 've always said it does n't matter what s wrong with me , he said i'm going to do my job no one was about to argue with that or jackson s own doubleentendre summation we are not surprised by anything dennis does , said the coach , wrinkling his brow under many regularseason conditions , this would not be considered a compliment , but then , even the zen master senses that , from the time rodman won game 4 of the knicks series with two magiclike assists , he and his players entered a spiritual place not previously explored what else could possibly explain rodman s book , bad as i wanna be , hitting no 1 \? the problem with this tome , salley said , is that it is not nonfiction i know everything there is to know about dennis rodman , salley said , and none of it was in that book the tempo of chapter 1 of this eastern conference final was set by rodman s firsthalf work he outrebounded the magic in the first quarter by himself , 84 he took horace grant \( 1 rebound and 0 points in 28 minutes \) out of the game until an injured elbow physically removed grant from the game he harassed o'neal his 13 points were 11 more than the combined effort of grant , nick anderson and dennis scott when it was over , rodman said something about coming to work with his game face on , then disappeared behind a lockerroom door and a sign that read absolutely no admittance fortyfive minutes later , there was rodman , the bestselling author , pumping furiously away on an abdominal machine he probably went home later to write
for the first time in months , judy and stephen goodhue may allow themselves to enjoy a holiday weekend that is because , thanks to the state legislature in albany yes , that state legislature it looks as though the goodhues will not have to worry about the care of their profoundly disabled son , jason jason and about 120 other young adults have been in limbo for up to a year because new york was threatening to stop paying for their care in institutions out of the state despite the chaos in albany over the budget , both chambers have approved a rescue bill to put an end to the threat parents have been hanging by their thumbs , mr goodhue said now , we 're waiting to see what george does legislators from both major parties expect gov george e pataki to sign the measure if he does , as parents see it , half the battle is won new york still wants its children to come home and some of their parents are resisting , contending that the state does not have the appropriate institutions for them i am elated that the legislature acted , said gerri bavaro , mother of lisa , who has been living in an institution in pennsylvania for 20 of her 27 years but the fight ai n't over lisa has cerebral palsy and is developmentally disabled when she was 7 , new york sent her to live at woods services in langhorne , pa , because the state did not have an adequate residence for her and the law obligates the state to give all new yorkers an education that entitlement ends when people turn 21 the state and localities agreed to share the cost of caring for those over the age of 21 until 1999 , when the state would take over but last year , new york city withdrew its financing , with westchester and suffolk counties following , and parents feared they would have no way of paying the cost of their children s care as high as 85 , 000 annually if the governor signs the bill , the concern of the parents will shift to where their children will live out their lives state officials cite many reasons for wanting them in new york , from a desire to return disabled people to the community , to bringing them closer to their families moreover , some young adults are still living in residences meant for children , and would be better off in adult homes in new york , officials in albany say but it is clear that the strongest impetus for bringing young people back home is financial the federal government picks up half the bill for those instate institutions but assumes none of the cost for new yorkers in outofstate institutions the same for the 100 or so people a year who reach 21 this would argue for the state to seek a waiver from washington , allowing the state to get medicaid reimbursement for new yorkers cared for out of state state officials reached yesterday , the start of the long holiday weekend , did not know if new york had ever filed for a medicaid waiver parents worry about their children , not medicaid formulas woods is home for lisa , ms bavaro said our kids may be disabled , but they are capable of understanding , learning , of forming relationships and they have done that there the state has sent her to look at a few potential homes for lisa one was on 34th street in manhattan , a coeducational residence in an elevator building worried about her daughter s safety , she rejected it as unacceptable the same for a home in cooperstown , over five hours away it takes her about two hours to get to woods a parents group is suing the state , contending that the institutions are inadequate or dangerous deborah sturm rausch , spokeswoman for the state office of mental retardation and developmental disabilities , denied the accusation , saying the office s primary mission is to assure that the highest quality of care is given to all the people they serve the goodhues , whose son lives three hours away at the melmark house in berwyn , pa , said they would love for jason , now 27 , to move closer but not at the sacrifice of care he has now , ms goodhue said nor has the state offered an alternative residence anyway steven sanders , the assembly bill s prime sponsor , said that while some parents are right to insist that their children stay where they are , he thinks most state placements are appropriate he added that he was gratified that the bill was passed , even if it did take a lawsuit and bad publicity to do it sometimes it is easier to identify with the plight of a few people than with multitudes , he said you can understand what a family is going through
each winter more and more american families are plagued by recurrent strep throats that pingpong among the children and their parents and do not quit until school finishes for the summer unlike the common cold , a far more familiar family plague during the school year , strep throat is much more than a pesky illness it is debilitating , costly and dangerous in addition to having a throat too sore to swallow water comfortably , the victims of strep throat are likely to feel sick all over parents , even those who remain healthy , often lose days from work to stay home with their ailing children the obligatory visit to the doctor , throat culture and antibiotic prescription can easily cost more than 100 and failure to properly diagnose and adequately treat each and every case of strep throat can sometimes result in a very serious , even lifethreatening complication rheumatic fever rheumatic fever was once nearly eradicated by the proper treatment of strep throat with penicillin , but the last 10 years have seen a resurgence of this deadly but preventable disease in cities like new york , salt lake city , pittsburgh , akron , columbus , nashville , charleston and morgantown in west virginia and at a few military bases among the reasons for recurrent strep infections and the resurgence of rheumatic fever , experts say , is a failure to use enough of the right antibiotic to eradicate the bacterium , betahemolytic group a streptococcus , that causes strep throats this can result in simmering and sometimes symptomless infections that may cause hidden damage or flare up again and again as a sore throat or spread to someone else contributing to the problem is an apparent decline in the ability of the standard penicillin regimen to eradicate the bacteria completely dr joseph appel , a pediatrician in kingston , ny , said that 5 to 10 percent of children have recurrent strep throats , three recurrences is not rare and a pingponging effect in families is quite common a mother may bring in one child , then a second child a few days later , then she herself gets sick two weeks later , the first child is sick again he said that the family dog might even be involved in the cycle in rare cases the dog can act as a carrier of strep bacteria , and until the dog is treated , various family members may continue to get sick veterinarians who test a dog should be aware that in such cases the bacteria live in the dog s anus rather than the throat is it strep \? most sore throats are caused by viruses and require only symptomatic treatment plenty of fluids , a pain reliever and rest viral sore throats typically occur with a cold and may be associated with a lowgrade fever \( especially in children \) , malaise , loss of appetite and discomfort upon swallowing no antibiotic is of any use and none should be taken strep throat , a bacterial infection that rarely occurs before the age of 2 , often begins in children with a headache , abdominal pain , vomiting and a fever that may soar to 104 degrees the throat becomes sore within hours of the first symptoms , with pain that can range from mild irritation to soreness so severe that even swallowing water is difficult strep throats are most common among young schoolage children , but people of all ages can and do become infected if exposed to a strain of the bacterium to which they are susceptible but it is not possible to tell if the infection is strep without a medical examination and laboratory test for the bacterium dr gary e ruoff , a family practitioner and researcher at the westside family medical center in kalamazoo and a clinical professor at michigan state university college of human medicine in lansing , says that patients with strep throat typically have enlarged lymph nodes \( glands \) in the neck , swollen tonsils , redness in the back of the throat , aches and pains in their muscles and probably fever but to be certain the infection is bacterial , a laboratory test is needed a culture of matter swabbed from the tonsils is the timehonored test , but it takes 24 to 48 hours to know if strep bacteria grew in the laboratory dish if a patient is very ill or likely to expose others , doctors often start antibiotics right away and stop them if the throat culture is negative meanwhile , the doctor may use a less reliable rapid antigendetection test , also done after a tonsil swab , that can reveal the presence of strep in two to three minutes , dr appel said breaking the cycle dr ruoff and dr martha lepow , a specialist in pediatric infectious diseases and chairman of pediatrics at albany medical college , said a failure to take the full antibiotic prescription was the main cause of treatment failure and recurrences older antibiotics like penicillin , which remains a preferred treatment against strep , must be taken three times a day for 10 days when patients begin to feel better after about 48 hours , treatment laxity creeps in doses are forgotten or , by day five or so , the entire regimen is stopped for patients allergic to penicillin , the doctor may prescribe erythromycin , which can cause stomach and intestinal upset and prompt people to stop taking the antibiotic as soon as they feel well but when the antibiotic regimen is not completed , some bacteria the toughest ones , dr ruoff remarked remain alive and can cause a recurrence or can infect someone else each failure to complete treatment thus favors the survival of bacteria best able to resist the antibiotic dr appel said that strep bacteria have become relatively resistant to penicillin in the 1940 s an infection could be eradicated with just 5 , 000 units of penicillin , but it now takes 1 million units , he explained even then , 12 percent to 17 percent of infections are not fully eradicated , dr ruoff said there are now newer antibiotic alternatives to penicillin that involve fewer daily doses and even shorter treatment periods they include antibiotics called cephalosporins , some of which involve doses only twice a day for five days although these drugs are much more expensive than penicillin , costing from 25 to 90 to treat one infection , as against only 5 or 6 for penicillin , dr ruoff maintains they are worth it if they improve patient compliance and reduce the likelihood of recurrence , which results in a far more costly doctor visit , throat culture and another round of antibiotics yet another problem may contribute to treatment failure , dr lepow suggested some people harbor in their mouths or throats bacteria that produce an enzyme , betalactamase , that can inactivate penicillin to get around this problem , doctors sometimes prescribe a combination drug , amoxicillin plus clavulanate \( augmentin \) , that can knock out the interference for children plagued by recurrent strep infections , dr lepow said that winterlong preventive treatment with a single daily dose of penicillin could be helpful and did not create antibioticresistant bacteria apparently the single dose is enough to stop bacterial growth before resistant strains can develop drawing
when president clinton first uttered the remark i feel your pain back in 1992 , he may have set himself up for years of razzing and mockery , but in one sense , at least , he was right the person he was addressing , an irate aids activist , was male a new report suggests that men and women experience pain very differently from one another , and that clinicians would do well to consider sex distinctions when prescribing pain medications researchers have found that a class of opiate drugs of little benefit in relieving pain in men work quite robustly in women the study indicates that the brain s circuitry for perceiving and responding to pain is wired roughly along either a male or female plan , although at this point scientists know nothing about what the underlying neurochemical differences may be dr jon d levine and his colleagues at the university of california at san francisco report in the november issue of nature medicine that when they administered drugs called kappa opioids to a group of 28 young men and 20 young women who were having their wisdom teeth extracted , the women had a far more powerful response to the drugs , and the easing of pain lasted considerably longer each patient received an intravenous dose of either nalbuphine , marketed under the trade name nubain , or butorphanol , marketed as stadol when all factors , including differences in body size were considered , the kappa opioids worked twice as well for the women as for the men significantly , the women had reported greater pain to begin with what we found was really much more dramatic than what we would have considered in our wildest imagination , dr levine said in the men , the response was small and shortacting , whereas the women were generally freed of their pain and were sent home hours later from the dental clinic with as much pain abatement as they initially had in fact , the scientists were so struck by the starkly divergent clinical outcomes that they assumed others must have observed the same sex differences in their use of kappa opioids but when they scoured the scientific literature , they found not a word of it apparently nobody had noticed , dr levine said nor had anybody ever asked the question , do women and men respond differently to drugs used in the treatment of pain \? dr karen j berkley , a neuroscientist at florida state university in tallahassee , who wrote a commentary that accompanies the new report , said in an interview that the discovery opens all kinds of important questions , and the fact that they did it is to be congratulated the discovery joins a growing list of unexpected physical and pharmacological differences between the sexes that researchers have only recently begun to tally they have inspired in their efforts by complaints from women s health advocates that women have too often been omitted from clinical trials and so have been treated by the medical profession rather like short men beyond obvious differences in reproductive organs and far more contentious claims of differences in innate behavior or skills with men billed as aggressive , competitive bisonhunter types who do well in mathematics , and women portrayed as the more cooperative gatherer types with a flair for language researchers have noticed a wide range of other , subtler variations the liver appears to differ between men and women , for example , which could explain why women metabolize alcohol and other drugs less efficiently than men do , and why they are more susceptible to alcoholrelated diseases depression is diagnosed far more often in women , yet men as a group respond better to antidepressant medication women infected with the human immunodeficiency virus often progress more quickly to fullfledged aids than do infected men when given anesthesia for surgery , women recover more rapidly than men do from its effects , waking up about 7 minutes after surgery as compared with men s 11 minutes , said dr peter s glass of duke university medical center none of the sex differences are absolute , but rather are group averages with considerable overlap in their new study , dr levine and his coworkers set out to look specifically at sex differences in response to pain medication , as part of a larger study to consider the influence of a spectrum of variations , like age and ethnicity , on a patient s response to various medical treatments they already knew that a number of studies had shown that women often report experiencing greater pain than men do in trials where women and men have been subjected to the same intense stimulus , women give it a higher pain rating than men do moreover , when asked about their overall clinical pains , women report aches and discomforts in more body parts than men do the meaning of such discrepancies is open to multiple interpretations , though , said dr berkley women might actually feel more pain , which is impossible to measure with current technology pain is a subjective experience that doctors can only gauge by asking a patient how much it hurts alternatively , men may be less willing to admit to pain than women are , for sociocultural reasons third , women may be sensibly less tolerant of pain , said dr berkley , and thus more demanding that they get some relief
callers flooded abc s phone lines yesterday to complain about or praise david brinkley for his criticism of president clinton in election coverage the night before the veteran journalist and commentator called mr clinton a bore with not a creative bone in his body , and said americans could expect more goddamned nonsense from him in the next four years mr brinkley , who is 76 and has covered every presidential election since 1956 , announced earlier this fall that he would retire from most of his abc duties , except for contributing a weekly commentary to the sunday interview program this week next sunday is to be his last day as host of that program most of his comments about mr clinton came late in abc s election coverage , shortly after 12 30 am yesterday , when abc s correspondents had gathered around the anchor , peter jennings , to discuss the election mr jennings told mr brinkley that his colleagues wanted to digress to talk about mr brinkley s contributions to abc news insisting on speaking first , mr brinkley cut mr jennings off and said sarcastically , we can all look forward with great pleasure to four years of wonderful , inspiring speeches , full of wit , poetry , music , love and affection plus more goddamned nonsense , implying he expected this from mr clinton interrupting him , mr jennings said , you ca n't say that on the air , mr brinkley well , i'm not on the air , he replied they continued chatting , and mr jennings again reminded mr brinkley that they were on the air mr brinkley then went on to say that he admired his colleagues at abc , especially the creativeness of their writing and their speech bill clinton has none of it , has not a creative bone in his body , he said therefore he is a bore , and always will be a bore mr brinkley also called mr clinton s victory speech on tuesday night one of the worst things i 've ever heard an abc spokeswoman , eileen murphy , said it was network policy not to say how many phone calls had been received , but she confirmed that the volume had been heavy some calls had praised mr brinkley s forthrightness , ms murphy said , and others had criticized him as disrespectful of mr clinton she also said mr brinkley could not be reached for comment yesterday because he was on the road
nairobi , kenya , may 25 every morning there are dozens of desperate people outside arthur o obel s office in downtown nairobi they wait for hours in sadeyed silence , hoping to get a bottle of the herbal potion that mr obel claims will rid them of aids sometimes there are about 100 people here , mr obel said , ushering another tearyeyed patient from his office how can i see them all \? i just ca n't cope in his hornrim glasses and linen suit , mr obel does not look much like a traditional healer , even if he is quick to tell a visitor he comes from a long line of them in the luyia tribe until a few months ago , he was a respected pharmacologist at the university of nairobi medical school , and he is a former deputy director of the national research center but since march 1 , mr obel has been at the center of a medical controversy over a herbal medicine he says he discovered he says his drug , which he calls pearl omega , can stop the aids virus from reproducing many of his medical colleagues say it is just a modern version of snakeoil the debate over mr obel s drug has grown into a divisive political issue in kenya , where about 1 in every 26 people is infected with hiv , the virus that causes aids none of this would be unusual in a country where traditional cures often compete with modern medicine , were it not for the fact that aides to president daniel arap moi have gone into business selling mr obel s concoction for high prices from a statefunded institute , the kenya biodiversity center , hastily opened in the industrial area of town ever since aids took root in africa , doctors trained in western medicine have had to struggle against the claims of traditional healers , herbalists and witch doctors that they can cure the disease they have also had to wrestle with customs like scarring , circumcision , wifesharing and polygamy that can sometimes spread the aids virus in some places , health officials have tried to work with traditional healers , persuading them , for instance , to promote the use of condoms along with their own remedies in others , officials have tried to convince people to use sterile instruments when practicing circumcision and scarring ceremonies mr obel , a westerntrained scientist , says his new treatment comes from a rare tropical plant he learned about from his grandfather , a traditional healer from western kenya he says he has distilled the plant into a sweet syrup that , he maintains , inhibits an enzyme , known as protease , that the aids virus needs to reproduce it s really nature s way of solving a natural problem , he said the sales of pearl omega have provoked an outcry from several quarters a group of aids patients has sued to stop distribution of the drug , arguing that mr obel is fleecing people some newspaper columnists have raised the possibility that the ruling party is using sales of the drug to build up a campaign war chest for a presidential election next year the kenya medical association has urged doctors not to prescribe it until its efficacy and safety have been established scientifically to hear mr obel tell it , he has been doing secret research on pearl omega with the blessing and financial support of the president s office since 1992 , when he left the kenya medical research institute earlier this year , he said , the president s aides took the production and marketing of the drug away from him the profits are all going to the government , he said , not to him the government took over , he said they took over the distribution , the selling , the marketing they incorporated me into the office of the president the president s office has remained silent about mr obel s claims , refusing to confirm or deny them we are in a nocomment situation , said winnie kitonga , a spokeswoman for the office the official policy is not to comment other health officials and employees at the kenya biodiversity center acknowledge that a former secretary to the president , daniel koech , was recently reassigned from mr moi s office to oversee the sales of pearl omega at the biodiversity center mr koech did not return several telephone calls from a reporter it remains unclear where the money is going advocates for people with aids said the drug continued to be sold this week despite a decision by mr moi s health ministry to ban it temporarily until more trials can be conducted in response , mr obel has argued that it is not illegal to sell the drug because it is a herbal remedy and not a controlled substance the milky brown concoction comes in a wine bottle with a screwoff top a paper label says it contains , among other things , 4 percent alcohol a price list says the cost for an entire 30day treatment ranges from 545 for kenyans to 5 , 000 for foreigners a patient has to drink about a cupful twice a day for 30 days to stop the virus from replicating itself , mr obel said almost no one in the kenyan medical establishment believes pearl omega works , though few have been willing to denounce mr obel publicly as a charlatan
sit down , look and listen , says the playwright , to which the playgoer replies make it worth my while reconfigure my sense of time and place show me something i think i already know , then make the scales fall from my eyes change the proportions and texture of experience vary the landscape , or give me a new place to view it from make me fit my rhythms \( my attention span , the speed and nature of my responses \) to yours , or let me play them against yours you have language , movement , sound and sight a complete vocabulary of visual design to work with playwrights have their difficulties , of course novelists get to write for audiences who are n't asked to gather together in a designated space and read at the same speed for a carefully prescribed length of time , paying close attention , since they are not likely to get a second chance theatergoers ca n't enter and exit as they please or stretch out and nap , knowing that when they wake up everything will be just where they left it technology has given composers an advantage too their music is more likely to be recorded and listened to at leisure and less likely to lose big chunks of character in the recording process art , like theater , must be seen in a public space , but museums , galleries and studios all charge less than theaters do and , in the end , they give us more freedom we can leave the room and come back , study the work from different angles , stay quiet or talk to a neighbor about what it is we 're seeing yet people keep going to the theater and , at present , people are saying that brian friel may be the finest living playwright in the englishspeaking world it is certainly true that he is a skilled , honorable and dependable craftsman people also say that he is becoming more of a novelist than a playwright , that after having written 17 plays and adapted or translated three more , he is making himself into an antitheatrical writer whose plays contain such rich , dense patterns of thought and language that audiences ca n't take everything in at one sitting it is said we need more time than an evening gives us to explore the lash and lilt of his dialogue the monologues are packed with stories , memories and reflections on men , women , birth , death and infinity those imagistic , elegiac speeches about so many things gardening , farming , swimming , dancing , leaving one language or country behind for another sometimes talk frames the action , as in dancing at lughnasa more often , it stops the action in order to frame a character s inner life it becomes the linguistic equivalent of a long , loving closeup molly sweeney , now at the roundabout theater company s laura pels theater , is a play made entirely of monologues and written almost entirely in the past tense it is , some say , splendid literature but taxing , ultimately nontheatrical theater i say that nonstop monologues and a perpetual past tense require a writer to use a broad palette of rhythms and emotional colors since mr friel does not do that here \( he did in faith healer , his 1979 play \) , molly sweeney grows monotonously dirgelike as literature and theater of course , a director can supply these muted or missing qualities through the look of the stage , the actors' bodies and voices , a sense of space , tempo and movement but , acting as his own director for the first time , mr friel has drawn on virtually none of these resources he uses elegiac stillness a great deal , and there s nothing wrong with that as wordsworth told us , it is emotion recollected in tranquillity that makes poetry but emotion presented tranquilly , dutifully and piously does not make for real poetry or real theater molly sweeney is the story of a competent , selfsufficient woman , blind since she was 10 months old , who at the age of 41 undergoes two operations that partially restore her sight they wholly alter her world the way she perceives , the way she learns \( how do you identify by sight what you have learned to identify by touch \? \) , her sense of boundaries and mastery , of beauty , order and terror let her speak in the words mr friel has given her they are lovely words in the first weeks after her operation , the world she saw or halfsaw filled her with surprise and delight but it was a foreign world , she learned , disquieting , even alarming every color dazzled every light blazed every shape an apparition , a specter that appeared suddenly from nowhere and challenged you and all that movement nothing ever still everything in motion all the time and every movement unexpected , somehow threatening even the sudden sparrows in the garden , they seemed aggressive , dangerous so that after a time the mind could absorb no more sensation and the only escape the only way to live was to sit absolutely still and shut the eyes tight and immerse yourself in darkness and wait then , when the hands were still and the heart quiet , slowly open the eyes again and emerge and try to find the courage to face it all once more
chicago , sept 6 the liggett group , which stunned and infuriated its larger rivals in the tobacco industry in march by agreeing to settle lawsuits that involved all the companies , is negotiating to avoid being dragged back into the litigation , lawyers involved in the talks say liggett s initial settlement agreements have already resulted in the first damage payments ever by a tobacco company 1 million to five of the states that sued the industry seeking compensation for smokingrelated health care expenditures but neither the agreement with the states nor the second settlement with lawyers who filed a class action on behalf of smokers nationwide won final court approval the future of both is now unclear at the time of the settlements in march , bennett s lebow , chairman of liggett s parent , the brooke group , argued that they opened a new path for the industry to begin putting tobacco litigation behind it he hoped the settlements would attract support from shareholders of rjr nabisco , the parent of r j reynolds tobacco , the nation s secondlargest tobacco company after philip morris mr lebow was seeking control of rjr to force the immediate spinoff of its nabisco food business and the eventual merger of its highly profitable tobacco operations with the struggling liggett , and the settlement terms included provisions for bringing rjr into the deals but the strategy backfired rjr shareholders sided with management , which said the settlement would be too expensive for rjr and was riddled with loopholes that could attract more lawsuits the class action settlement , for example , covered only lawsuits based on a theory that cigarettes are addictive the concept of a settlement was fine , but it has to be more comprehensive , said gary black of sanford bernstein they only took out 2 percent of the ways you could sue the industry since then , the outlook has become especially murky for the class action settlement , which would have required liggett to pay up to 50 million over 25 years toward smoking cessation programs that agreement was based on the assumption that a mississippi lawsuit called castano would be approved as a national class action lawsuit but the court of appeals for the fifth circuit agreed with the industry in may that there was no national class of smokers , making it uncertain whether the castano lawyers could settle on behalf of anyone except the castano family liggett and the plaintiffs' lawyers are now exploring two strategies , according to people familiar with the talks one involves asking the courts overseeing castano to rule that even where there are too many differences among smokers to treat them as a group in a trial , they can be regarded as a class in a voluntary settlement the simpler approach , lawyers say , might be to file a new class action lawsuit in another state against liggett alone mr lebow declined to characterize the talks but said we intend to settle this as a class action in some jurisdiction as of right now , the terms are the same , word for word liggett also intends to pursue its agreement with the states that agreement requires it to pay between 2 percent and 7 percent of pretax income for 24 years to the settling states in addition to its initial payments to the five original states florida , massachusetts , mississippi , west virginia and louisiana the settlement allows liggett to withdraw if too few other states join in so far , none have , although people familiar with the situation say several states have been talking about joining in the next few weeks mr lebow suggested that the company might be willing to make modest payments beyond those required in the agreement to encourage them , the equivalent of a signing bonus for an athlete or executive liggett just ca n't afford a scorchedearth litigation policy , mr lebow said one major judgment against liggett would put us out of business mr lebow added that he thought that his wealthier rivals were underestimating the risks of litigating every case instead of seeking global settlements philip morris and rjr both declined to comment on liggett s continuing settlement efforts one settlement liggett cannot afford is the recently floated proposal for a deal in which congress would impose a settlement on the entire industry while no such deal is anywhere near being struck , the outlines of the initial proposals made known late last month would require payments based on market share rather than on profits
for anyone who ever attended a catholic school , a few minutes at st john school in old saybrook will stir up a lot of memories orderly lines of little people , girls in plaid skirts , boys in shirts and ties , file quietly along the corridors to their classrooms , past the religious pictures and statuary , past sister marie alberta , the principal after more than four decades as a teacher and administrator , sister marie alberta , garbed in an oldfashioned black habit that reaches to her shoes , conveys authority she is a presence and the little people know it they will flock around her , chattering away , when that is appropriate but there is a time for work and a time for play , and sometimes she must emphasize that school is mostly a place for study , and reverence , not a place to be horsing around one steady gaze from sister marie alberta is usually enough to impose a more exalted way of thinking she is an oldfashioned sister of the church , a circumstance in which she takes pride and st john is an oldfashioned school it is also a newfashioned success story twentyfour years ago , the school , a onestory modern structure only eight years old , was shut down the closing was a harbinger of what would happen to many other parochial schools in connecticut and elsewhere in the next two decades they were too expensive to maintain teaching sisters were in short supply and lay teachers wanted salaries the schools could not afford many of the schools ceased to be , some going quietly and others , including south catholic high in hartford , after bitter and noisy protests from parents two years ago , however , st john reopened , an event noteworthy nationwide according to the national catholic education association , st john , headed by a religious sister but with a staff mostly of lay teachers , was the only one of its kind , a kindergarten through eighth grade parochial school , to open in the entire country in 1994 and plans have already been made for an eightroom addition , symbolizing an extension of what howard e bennett considers a real success story that started as a real gamble mr bennett , a retired superintendent of public schools in connecticut and new york , was hired six years ago by bishop daniel p reilly , then head of the catholic diocese of norwich , to oversee its schools the diocese includes most of eastern connecticut and some communities , like old saybrook , west of the connecticut river while the archdiocese of hartford and the diocese of bridgeport had closed down many schools over the past decade , bishop reilly had somehow kept his 25 schools in operation mr bennett said the bishop s first directive to him was that he did n't want any schools closed he said he responded with a question how about opening some schools \? the bishop thought that was a good idea st john was decided on for a starter because the building had been used as a parish education center for the two decades after it closed as a school and was in relatively good shape mr bennett , however , was surprised at the reception he received from the st john parish council when he told its members of the intent to reopen the school some were a great deal less than enthralled with the plan it was unbelievable , he said , people were yelling about who were we to tell them what to do it was really hostile the superintendent , holder of a doctorate in education , teacher of sacred law on the university level , father of six and an exmarine , admits that when he is attacked he attacks back in fact , he said , he loves confrontations it keeps him sharp consequently he laid out the directive in old saybrook the bishop wants to reopen the school , the school will be reopened , case closed but , he admits , the success of the school was problematic at the time when it reopened on aug 31 , 1994 , it had only 82 students a year and half later , however , it has 214 we get requests for admissions every day , said sister marie alberta most have to be rejected because there is little room left , and none in the first four grades perhaps the most surprising statistic is that 46 of the pupils , about one in four , are not catholics \( noncatholic parents say they are looking for a school with structure and discipline \) mr bennett credits sister marie alberta and her order for much of the success of st john the order , the sisters of charity of our lady mother of the church , traces its connecticut history to the village of baltic in the last century a textile mill owner in the eastern connecticut town petitioned an order of catholic sisters from the netherlands to send some members over to provide education for the children of his workers in 1874 , the sisters established the academy of the holy family , a school for girls in baltic that they still run , and later expanded into other educational centers and social and charitable work today , the sisters number 100 , 8 of whom are catholic elementary school principals in connecticut they no longer have a connection to europe , however in 1970 , they split from their original order and became an independent order approved by the vatican the issue was modernizing
the smallcapitalization stock market has been on a rollercoaster , exploding higher at the start of the second quarter this year and then falling just as hard toward the quarter s end before recovering just a bit so it is not surprising if investors feel a little dizzy does all the activity mean investors should make equally frenetic moves \? for longterm holdings , like retirement money , a little finetuning is as far as investment advisers seem willing to go only two of the five advisers who created hypothetical retirement portfolios for the new york times three years ago are making any changes for the third quarter and even they are sitting tight on their allocations to smaller stocks the nasdaq s june retreat may seem like an appropriate time to sell smallcap stocks , said eric kobren , president of insight management ofwellesley , mass the index of more than 6 , 000 stocks fell 5 percentplus since its record high close on june 5 \( a drop that would have deepened to 76 percent but for the endofquarter uptick \) our view is that the smallcap cycle is still intact and that many exciting opportunities lie in wait among the five advisers , the top performer in the latest quarter is harold evensky , of coral gables , fla his portfolio rose 442 percent as a result of diversified holdings that performed well like mr kobren , he likes small stocks , which , as measured by the nasdaq composite index , rose more than 13 percent in the quarter until starting to slide in june we do n't expect these returns to continue , mr evensky said , but we do expect them to outperform bigcapitalization stock funds over the next economic cycle but he is shifting part of his smallstock allocation from pennsylvania mutual into the company s royce lowpriced stock fund he said he was intrigued by the fund s strategy , buying value stocks with share prices of 15 or less over all , a mix of large and smallcap stocks is best for good longterm performance , the advisers say you probably should have both because they switch back and forth , said sheldon jacobs of the noload fund investor in irvington , ny that is not to say that if small stocks are pounded enough , investors should n't look for bargains but even a loss of 10 percent or so would n't be sufficient , said john rekenthaler , publisher of morningstar mutual funds in chicago , who is making no changes in his portfolio given the recent smallcap runup , he would wait for losses of about 25 percent before buying the managers distinguish between smallcap growth stocks and smallcap value stocks when discussing them smallcap growth funds , which typically invest in volatile technology stocks and initial public offerings , were the highfliers this year until they began retreating in june but smallcap value funds , which tend to own lowpriced stocks , have held their ground better a balanced longterm portfolio should keep about 15 percent in smallcap growth stocks and 15 percent in the more staid smallcap value arena , mr rekenthaler said since the contest began on july 7 , 1993 , the portfolios have risen an average of 469 percent , compared with 632 percent for the vanguard s p 500 index fund , which mimics the standard poor s 500 mr jacobs s portfolio retains the threeyear lead , with a 61 percent gain all five portfolios made money in the quarter and they ran neck and neck with the s p 500 index fund none trailed its gain of 445 percent by more than onehalf of one percentage point over all , the advisers are recovering handily from their struggles to beat the index last year , which only 15 percent of united states diversified equity funds managed in 1995 the portfolio performance , tracked quarterly by lipper analytical services inc of summit , nj , excludes sales charges , transaction costs and tax considerations because most retirement money is held in taxdeferred accounts the five experts can choose funds that are open to new investors and can shift money quarterly , although the portfolios are intended to grow for 20 years mr jacobs is making three changes to his portfolio , two to upgrade into betterperforming funds , he said he is substituting the janus olympus fund , with 368 million in assets , for the 2 billion janus mercury , which has lagged behind its sibling so far this year similarly , he is leaving the oakmark fund , which , he said , has ballooned to 4 billion and has n't kept up with its peers this year , for the 150 million baron growth and income , which has had a banner year without any technology or biotechnology stocks it capitalized on gains in real estate investment trusts , health care and financial services mr jacobs s final move is out of invesco balanced and into heartland value and income , because the manager

nervous about the overall united states market \? not really while it is easy to listen to market prognosticators and 'run for the hills , ' this markettiming strategy has time and again proved to be

london what do you do after you have made more than 70 films , opened three restaurants , written one autobiography and won an oscar \? if you are michael caine , you give up the hollywood rat race , with all the attendant fears of boxoffice flops that haunt movie idols , and you rest on your laurels until , that is , you tote up the costs of a life of leisure then you get back to work i started to retire three times , the british star of alfie and the man who would be king recalled last week but each time , i felt i spent too much , and i realized i could n't last out until i was 100 years old not that he would have sunk back into the poverty he knew growing up in the east end of london , where his father gambled away most of the wages he earned as a porter at the billingsgate fish market mr caine , 63 , estimates that he has accumulated a fortune of 24 million though nearly half is in stocks and other financial instruments , he and his wife , shakira , also own three homes he values at about 5 million the balance is tied up in the business he loves best restaurants i have a portfolio of safe and boring shares , but they 're no fun , he said over a lunch of braised rabbit with grain mustard sauce at his shepherd s restaurant here if you have money , you have to enjoy it one of my ways is gambling on restaurants how odd , is n't it , to find a brit , particularly one who hobnobs with prince andrew and lady thatcher , willing almost eager to discuss his finances \? mr caine does n't think so the english talk about money , he said what they do n't want is for you to talk about your money , and particularly if they do n't have any money themselves and so , dressed in jeans and a sport shirt , he talked about his philosophy of investing , and why he likes to take an active role each time he retired , he was n't happy watching the cash flow out the expenditures go up because you have more time to spend money on stuff and going places , mr caine said with the gentrified cockney accent so familiar to moviegoers so , each time , after a brief rest , he rushed back to gainful employment in 1992 , after writing his autobiography , what s it all about \? and taking some time off , he grew restless and returned to the activities that have always made him money movies and restaurants he took the lead role in the film noises off , and in 1993 opened two more london restaurants , shepherd s , an oldfashioned englishstyle grill that is already a favorite haunt of members of parliament , and the canteen today , mr caine devotes most of his business energies to his growing restaurant empire he owns a half interest in each of five london restaurants , which also include langan s brasserie , which dates to 1976 , and two frenchstyle bistros that mr caine and a partner took over in the mid1980 s he is planning to start his first american restaurant soon , which he has named the south beach brasserie , in a former miami beach synagogue that later became a jehovah s witness kingdom hall several other restaurant proprietors estimated his interest in the five restaurants , along with the land he bought for the florida business , at 8 million or more they currently generate roughly 13 million in annual sales and 2 million in profits , of which he gets half , he says and of his 1 million take , he adds , i reinvest about half in the businesses that leaves him 500 , 000 to pursue the good life that he enjoys though he has never started a restaurant that failed , mr caine might have made more , with less effort , in passive investments like mutual funds but the food trade was in his blood the question is , why \? i have psychoanalyzed myself and concluded that it s show business , he said thoughtfully it s the contact with people if you look at who has done it , they are all movie actors i was a theater actor for many years then i became a movie actor compared with the stage , a movie studio is a very cold place , he added you lose touch with people owning a restaurant is like going back into the theater you think of it in terms of opening a play or stage show 'will anyone come \? will it get good reviews \? ' while running restaurants takes most of his time , mr caine believes in spreading his risks he and his wife own a sprawling london apartment above the canteen , at chelsea harbor a country estate that he fondly calls shangrila , on the banks of the thames 40 miles west of london , and a new apartment in south beach with a view of the bay we live like a couple of drunken gangsters , mr caine says halfjokingly we do n't have kidneyshaped swimming pools or minklined bathtubs we do n't do silly things but we have a very expensive life style we like to have a really smashing life in truth , while the caines live it up , they keep a close eye on their finances yet mr caine says he knows little about the financial markets , and lets professionals handle the balance of his investments about 11 million in pension plans , stocks , bonds , real estate and other deals

when it opened last fall , new york state s new drug program for prisoners was supposed to represent a leap in thinking about criminal justice the center would be the state s first attempt to divert about 3 , 400 addicted felons a year away from teeming prisons and into treatment but a year after the center , the willard drug treatment campus , opened on the shore of seneca lake with an annual budget of 191 million , hundreds of willard s beds remain empty that is because the power to decide which defendants can be sentenced to willard rests with prosecutors , not judges and prosecutors have overwhelmingly refused to allow prisoners to participate last year , for example , the manhattan district attorney sent just 38 defendants to willard the bronx district attorney sent 10 the prosecutors say the threemonth program , intended mostly for secondtime , nonviolent drug offenders , is too short to assure either successful rehabilitation or sufficient punishment pataki administration officials retort that not only is 90 days better than none at all , but it will also suffice for many addicts now some judges , who resent having to cede sentencing control to prosecutors , are speaking out on willard s behalf willard is a good program , said harold j rothwax , an acting justice in state supreme court in manhattan with a reputation for imposing tough sentences if the da s had consented to a fair number of defendants and it had n't worked out , i 'd understand , but they 've never even given it a fair chance and so willard , intended as a pathbreaking departure from strict drug laws passed in the 1970 s that have largely been responsible for prison overcrowding , has instead become the locus of colliding criminal justice interests over treatment , punishment , prison beds and sentencing authority in philosophy and scheduling , willard is a hybrid of other programs housed in the hulking brick buildings of a former psychiatric institution , it borrows from boot camps for entrylevel offenders , with spartan , militaristic dorms , dawn risings and drills yet with its individual and group therapy and high school classes , it also bears some resemblance to longterm residential treatment centers when an inmate graduates from the upstate center and returns home , he or she is subject to intensive supervision for six months , including regular drug screenings , plus counseling for finding jobs , health care and housing the supervision gradually diminishes over the next six months as of late september , only 184 of willard s 850 beds were filled with the kind of defendants envisioned by pataki administration officials addicted dealers who would have otherwise occupied prison cells for at least twoandahalf years an additional 321 beds were taken by parole violators , who would have been sent back to prison , but for a minimal amount of time nearly 350 beds were unused according to the new york state department of corrections , mediumsecurity prisons are at about 130 percent of capacity a departmental survey taken last december of the 70 , 000 state inmates found that 66 percent had drug or alcohol abuse problems , a figure which department officials described as conservative , because it was based on selfreporting in the meantime , waiting lists for drug treatment programs within the prison walls are years long and as the full impact of the longer sentences for repeat , violent offenders , approved last year by the legislature , take effect , overcrowding is expected to get worse willard was central to the 1995 sentencing proposal , and an important reason why many democratic legislators agreed to vote for it if governor pataki wanted to usher more violent felons into the system , they wanted some indication that he would also be able to usher out less violent ones who , statistics show , are increasingly taking up prison space but when the program was proposed , district attorneys threatened to boycott it to qualify for willard , the typical defendant , who was probably caught selling 10 worth of crack or heroin to an undercover officer , has to plead guilty to a lowlevel felony prosecutors said that if they could not control whether a defendant would be sent to willard or to prison , then they would simply refuse to allow defendants to plead guilty to the felony level low enough to be eligible for willard and so legislators handed prosecutors , not judges , the power to decide which defendants could draw a twoandahalf to fiveyear sentence and then be immediately paroled to willard kenneth ives , a legal aid supervisor , said defense lawyers were frustrated because even when a judge recommends that a defendant be sent to willard , prosecutors routinely refuse only the extraordinary cases a young man with a 65 iq , a 64yearold man caught with a small amount of cocaine have gotten permission , he said , not the ordinary guy that willard was set up for steven m fishner , the executive assistant to the manhattan district attorney , robert m morgenthau , said , we felt we had a responsibility to be very , very conservative towards a program that would quickly return drug dealers to the neighborhoods where they sold drugs
a city caseworker has been dismissed for mishandling the case of elisa izquierdo , the 6yearold girl who was beaten to death by her mother while her case was under the city s watch , officials said yesterday the dismissal of the caseworker , adriano navalo , marks the first time ever that a caseworker s job has been terminated by the city s child welfare agency this case demonstrates that caseworkers will be held accountable for their failures to protect children when they do not follow regulations and dictated practices , nicholas scoppetta , the commissioner of the administration for children s services , said in a statement released yesterday only in this way will we properly credit the efficient and effective work of the vast majority of caseworkers , he said the city has also recommended the dismissal of mr navalo s supervisor , thomas gorse jr , who was responsible for overseeing his employee s work , but never detected that mr navalo had failed to make required home visits and to properly investigate allegations of abuse in the elisa izquierdo case and eight other unrelated cases this was an individual and a supervisor who were grossly negligent in handling not only this case but other cases as well , said maggie lear , a spokeswoman for the child welfare agency the dismissal of mr navalo , which was reported in the new york post yesterday , comes eight months after elisa s battered body was found in her mother s apartment in a lower manhattan housing project on nov 22 subsequent investigations found that the city s child welfare system had been repeatedly notified of the dangers the girl was facing but did little to stop the abuse mr navalo , a city caseworker for eight years , failed to make required visits to the family and ignored clear signs that elisa s home situation was deteriorating rapidly , city officials said these included the mother s statement that she was overwhelmed , as well as her failure to keep appointments with counseling services mr navalo was also accused of closing the case last june , rather than developing a comprehensive service plan for the family and monitoring elisa s condition during the second half of 1995 and he recommended that elisa s mother get custody of the child and was not even aware that a cousin was seeking custody , ms lear said after elisa s death , the city reviewed all of mr navalo s cases and found a similar lack of following through in other cases as well , ms lear said none of those children have died the two employees went through a series of hearings before labor relations panels , ms lear said on aug 20 an arbitrator decided that mr navalo s employment should be terminated a decision has not yet been made in the case of mr gorse , who has been suspended without pay gary maitland , a lawyer for mr navalo , did not respond to phone messages , but ms lear said he is appealing his dismissal
san francisco , feb 5 the executive in charge of the american express retail travel business has resigned to become president and chief executive of middlegate inc , a new startup venture that plans to develop an internetoriented travel system to compete against conventional travel agents john l williams jr , formerly the general manager of the american express consumer travel network , the nation s largest retail travel agency , will head the new company , which has the financial backing of three silicon valley venture capital firms accel partners , new enterprise associates and hummer winblad venture partners it is also backed by the intel corporation and rupert murdoch s news corporation none of the principals would disclose any financial details of the new company the new venture is an attempt to take advantage of growing consumer interest in the internet with intelligent agent software and technology that can accommodate personal preferences of users the company believes this will make it possible for individual travelers to take over their own travel reservations the system , which was created originally by a group led by john evans , the former president of news and electronic data inc , a news corporation subsidiary , is an effort to more effectively harness computer technologies to create systems that can make reservations , or change them , on a moment s notice , based on a data base that creates a detailed profile of a customer s travel preferences customers are looking for greater control over the transactions themselves , mr williams said they also want travel information at their fingertips he noted that there are tremendous distribution costs in the traditional travel reservation business , making it vulnerable to lowercost competition that could allow middlegate s system to reach the mainstream of the nation s 100 billion travel business quickly we have tremendous opportunities to reduce those costs , he said middlegate , which is based in new york city , has also hired a veteran technologist , peter miller , to finish the development of the middlegate system , which has the code name marilyn mr miller was previously vice president for interactive services at viacom inc , and head of engineering for the consumer products division at apple computer mr miller has headed the advanced technology group at lotus development and was a cofounder of on technology inc with mitchell kapor , the founder of lotus while socalled intelligent agents have long been held out as one of the most compelling aspects of the power of modern computing , they have been slow in coming the marilyn system was originally developed for use in the general magic telescript network , but that technology has stumbled and the internet has taken off , and as a consequence middlegate is now refining the system to work with the world wide web however , in the future it might encompass wireless technologies , mapping data and information such as restaurant and city reviews to be able to provide customers with detailed recommendations and travel instructions it will be possible to present the customer with an itinerary down to a level of telling him how to find the parking garage on a business trip , said joe schoendorf , a managing partner in accel partners he said that kind of travel service would appeal to smaller businesses and individual travelers who traditionally have relied on travel agents to coordinate their plans this is aimed in the first phase at the under50person company and the power traveler who has to do his own thing , he said analysts said that the challenge for the new venture would be the actual human use of the system the hardest part of doing a travel agent s job is not making the reservations but understanding what the customer wants to do , said richard shaffer , editor of the technologic partners computerletter , an industry publication mr williams has been at american express since 1988 before heading the consumer travel network , he managed the company s platinum card business in the united states before coming to american express , he worked as a consultant with the gartner group , advising companies information technology mr evans , who is chairman of middlegate , left the news corporation in august when the technology was spun out and middlegate was formed
san francisco , july 5 if marijuana is ever legalized and magic brownie mixes ever appear on the shelves of america s supermarkets , there will be one obvious candidate to become the betty crocker , the mrs field , the sara lee , of cannabis baking her name , as almost any san franciscan can tell you , is brownie mary her real name is mary rathbun but her famous brownies , her great kindness to aids patients and her repeated arrests have made her such a public figure here that no last names were needed when , for example , the city officially declared aug 25 , 1992 , to be brownie mary day for about 15 years , ms rathbun , who is now almost 74 , has been donating magic brownies and unadulterated cookies to dying patients and volunteering in the aids ward of san francisco general hospital , winning acclaim in the city that has suffered intensely from the epidemic but these days , the battle she has waged all along the way the fight to legalize the use of marijuana for patients suffering from aids , cancer and other ailments like glaucoma , whose symptoms are said to be alleviated by the drug , has taken on special urgency two processes have converged in a statewide referendum in november , voters appear likely to approve a measure legalizing the compassionate use of marijuana and brownie mary s own health has been failing i say to her every day , i say , 'mary , you 've got to live , ' said dennis peron , probably san francisco s most prominent marijuana advocate and ms rathbun s longtime comradeinarms she had given up three months ago she said she was going to michigan to see dr kevorkian , because she was just in so much pain , and i said , 'mary , you ca n't go see kevorkian until november' that argument carries weight with ms rathbun , who suffers from arthritis and an array of ailments that have kept her laid up and unable to bake at all this year although the ailments she admits to are not terminal , she is in constant pain and her failing health has melted away the comfortable grandmotherly plumpness she used to have ms rathbun , whose source of income is social security checks the marijuana is donated by growers says she does indeed want to see the medical use of marijuana legalized before she dies , for those she calls her kids , the hundreds , if not thousands , of aids patients she has helped i think i might live to see it , i really do , she said , adding that if california does approve the ballot measure as pollsters predict , gov pete wilson , who has vetoed similar proposals by the legislature , will wet his pants , he really will if being ornery helps , ms rathbun will surely make it although much of her fame stems from the outrageous picture of the police arresting a sweet little old lady for baking brownies to help sick people , no one could be further from a milquetoast when she was 13 and growing up in minneapolis , ms rathbun said , she struck back at a nun who had caned her and got in a few good licks herself that was the end of catholic school and of living at home she took an apartment and went to work in the afternoons , beginning a waitressing career of more than 50 years she remains an atheist to this day she came out to san francisco during world war ii with some friends , was married for a while and had a daughter who later died in an automobile accident at 22 friends say the loss of her daughter may have helped spur ms rathbun later on to take on so many aids patients , adopting dozens of kids to replace the one she lost ms rathbun says , however , that she has always volunteered , that it comes naturally a marijuana enthusiast for decades she routinely samples her own wares , typically eating half a brownie in the morning and the other half in the afternoon without her own sweet medicine , she says , she could never do so much walking on her two artificial knees she began baking large quantities of pot brownies in the 1970 s , offering them for sale , long before she started her charitable baking smoking cigarettes and taking frequent drinks of water to offset the cottonmouth of the pills she must juggle , ms rathbun sat in her studio in a housing complex for the elderly in the largely gay castro neighborhood and recalled the days when customers used to line up along the stairs to her old apartment waiting for their dozen or two dozen brownies her first arrest came in 1980 , when the police raided the little home bakery that was turning out as many as 50 dozen brownies a day , she said , and the second a couple of years later when she was walking down the street with some brownies meant for a friend with cancer after the third arrest in 1992 , her fame really took off , and she still , to her own bemusement , is asked to do interviews for european television and photo shoots the demand among aids patients for her free brownies grew so great that she took to pulling names from a cookie jar to see who would get the next dozen ms rathbun is willing , though not eager , to talk what she will not do under any circumstances is reveal the secret recipe to her brownies , except to say that the trick is to figure out your recipe and follow it precisely she and mr peron put out a small cookbook in 1993 , brownie mary s marijuana cookbook and dennis peron s recipe for social change that includes marijuanalaced recipes for black bean soup , chip dip , spaghetti sauce and chestnut stuffing but no brownies when and if they legalize it , i 'll sell my brownie recipe to betty crocker or duncan hines , she said , and take the profits and buy an old victorian for my kids with aids although her secret remains intact , ms rathbun has nonetheless inspired a generation of imitators here , whose brownies may not be as good but who find creative ways to mix pot with banana bread , spice cake and other dishes many distribute their wares at the cannabis buyers' club , an 11 , 000member san francisco institution whose mission tolerated by the police because it is condoned by city officials is to supply marijuana to people with aids , cancer and other conditions that a doctor has certified would be helped by the drug bettye jones , a volunteer at the club who often whips up enough pasta for 200 club members , dumping about half a cup of marijuana into the sauce , said ms rathbun has served as a model for her and many others as they experiment with ways to keep the pot from losing its potency to the heat of cooking certain district attorneys and police officers may not like ms rathbun because none of the charges against her have brought anything worse than probation and the latest ones in 1992 were dropped they wish they never heard the name 'brownie mary , ' ms rathbun said gleefully but at the club , she is a celebrity she stepped up as a patriotic american to make something right which was wrong , said a customer at the club , joseph paul , 45 last week , when she entered on uncertain legs for the first time since january , the main room full of scores of potsmokers erupted in spontaneous applause she hopes to get back to baking by the end of the month or at least , supervising she has been very , very sick for a long , long time , said beth moore , the club s manager and ms rathbun s frequent apprentice baker she has been in extreme pain , but she s still filled with love photo voters in california will decide whether to legalize marijuanafor medicinal use mary rathbun , who grows marijuana , is called brownie mary because of the marijuanalaced baked goods she makes for sick people \( jim wilson the

shell game a true story of banking , spies , lies , politics and the arming of saddam hussein by peter mantius st martin s , 2395 iraqgate was a hard one to follow after operation desert storm came revelations , in odd little bursts , of a scheme that had funneled billions into saddam hussein s military buildup through the atlanta branch office of an italian bank united statesbacked credits for agricultural commodities were involved so were a truck plant in scotland , british arms makers with an office outside cleveland and a turkish conglomerate that dealt heavily in kickbacks all of which might have been busily and illegally carrying out the will of the reagan and bush administrations reconstructing this mess is a task that none of the government investigators assigned to it accomplished very well so much easier , practically everyone found , to attribute the torrent of unsecured money into iraq to a bank branch manager who could n't say no and then took the loans off the books in shell game , peter mantius , a reporter at the atlanta constitution , has done a more gratifying job mr mantius is at his best tracing the moves of christopher drogoul , the smooth but not brilliant branch manager , but he also sets out the machinations of the justice and commerce departments , the defense intelligence agency and other , less conspicuous players shell game is a resource , if not a pageturner the shabbiest deals between people no one has ever heard of can have the most amazing consequences , like the execution of a foreign policy no one ever heard of mr mantius s account , which is smart , tenacious and uncompromised , tells us how that happens laura mansnerus
atlanta , oct 10 facing greg maddux is usually a death sentence for the st louis cardinals the fourtime cy young award winner had dominated them over his eight previous starts , posting an incomparable 60 record with a 079 earned run average that included a 20 record in three starts this year , when he gave up just two earned runs in 23 innings contrast that record with cardinal starter todd stottlemyre s he was 03 in three starts against the braves this season , and the logical conclusion was that atlanta would be heading to st louis with a twogamestonone lead in the fourofsevengame national league championship series so much for logic instead of being down two games , the cardinals will return to st louis with the split they so desperately wanted after beating maddux and the braves , 83 , tonight at fulton county stadium a grand slam by third baseman gary gaetti off maddux highlighted a fiverun seventh inning that broke a 33 tie and stunned a sellout crowd of 52 , 067 gaetti s rocket high over the leftfield wall came with two outs , on a first pitch from maddux , a slider that hung over the plate the fifth grand slam in nlcs history , and gaetti s second home run of the postseason , also scored mark sweeney , royce clayton and brian jordan , who had reached during an inning in which maddux struggled with his control i know it did n't look like a slider , maddux said let s just say it was an attempt at one i wanted to throw it off the plate , so i could get him to chase it it was a bad pitch i was n't close to where i was aiming gaetti , who played despite a sprained right ankle , had been hitless in his previous three atbats he came to the plate after jordan was intentionally walked to load the bases when they walked me , i had a feeling he was going to jump on the first pitch , and he did , jordan said gaetti said he just wanted to be aggressive you ca n't take a whole lot of pitches against that guy , he said if he gets deep in the count against you , he can make you look silly i just tried to swing hard in case i hit it i'm not going to get in a guessing game with a guy like maddux because it does n't work ray lankford started the scoring in the big inning by giving st louis a 43 lead with a sacrifice fly to center that scored mike gallego a throwing error by third baseman chipper jones , who was trying to make a play on a bunt by sweeney , had put gallego in position to score gaetti s homer finished maddux for the night maddux allowed nine hits and two walks in six and twothirds innings only three of the eight runs against him were earned he struck out three we put a lot of pressure on him by getting runners on base , jordan said after a travel day friday , the series will resume saturday at busch stadium , where the next three games will be played the way we see it is , we got one , they got one and that means we both need three to win , said cardinal manager tony la russa the series looks a lot different going to st louis , 11 , rather than down two stottlemyre got the victory , although he was lifted for a pinchhitter with the scored tied at 33 in the sixth inning he pitched decently , giving up three runs on four hits he kept his team in the game in the sixth inning when the braves scored just one run , and could have had more , after loading the bases with one out ryan klesko tied the score with a runscoring single to right but with the bases still loaded , stottlemyre got jermaine dye on an infield popup and struck out the pinchhitter terry pendleton with a fastball when todd limited all that potential damage to just one run , it was one of the biggest lifts of the ball game , la russa said dennis eckersley finished off the braves by pitching the final one and a third innings he entered with two outs in the eighth inning , after the cardinals had a pair of runners reach on errors in describing the lift the cardinals got from the victory , gaetti said , it feels the way you feel after a really good meal very satisfying it was not so satisfying for maddux he was down by 30 early after clayton singled and scored in the first and runscoring doubles by ron gant and jordan produced a pair of runs in the third but the braves tied the score on a tworun home run by marquis grissom in the third and a klesko s run batted in in the sixth maddux , however , could not hold st louis , and now the series is tied tonight we had our backs against the wall and came out fighting and scratching , jordan said we 're here to play we 're not going to be intimidated by anybody we 're more relaxed than those guys the pressure is on them inside pitch mark hirschbeck , the younger brother of john hirschbeck , was the plate umpire thursday night mark hirschbeck remained unhappy with the ramifications of the incident in which baltimore s roberto alomar spit at his brother i ca n't accept that they let it die and do n't have a set of ground rules for things like this , mark hirschbeck said after gold gloves were awarded wednesday to outfielders barry bonds , marquis grissom and steve finley , st louis right fielder brian jordan said he deserved the defensive award i ca n't play any better defense than i 've played the last two years , he said i 've made three errors in two years it makes me upset , but what can i do \? jordan was particularly critical of bonds s selection i 've seen him drop some routine ones i'm not saying he s not a great outfielder , i just do n't know what the criteria are a sellout crowd of 52 , 067 watched the game , compared with game 1 , when there were some 3 , 000 empty seats photo the cardinals' gary gaetti hitting a grand slam in the seventh inning of game 2 of the nlcs last night \( associated press \) \( pg b14 \)
peekskill incongruities at the old paramount theater here begin with the popstyle marquee that projects from a halftimbered facade , which , in size if not craftsmanship , would have dazzled the medieval inventors of the style they continue inside with an upstairs corridor that is hung not with photographs of the stars but with an exhibition of paintings the show comes as no surprise , though , for this is now the paramount center for the arts what may startle visitors is the nature of the art , summed up by the show s resonant title , driven to abstraction the power of color and form so far from being gate crashers , the 32 pictures are guests invited by the theater s visual arts committee as are the show s curators , marcy freedman and alexandra rutsch to judge from a city pamphlet , peekskill is not short of artists , nor does it want for galleries but when planning their show , ms freedman and ms rutsch decided to solicit slides from other parts of new york and adjoining states as a result , they received 250 entries its romantic title to the contrary , the show is a fairly conventional assortment , ranging from geometry to abstract expressionism examples of the first are carla rae johnson s checkerboards in bright colors rimmed in gold representing the opposite extreme is don wunderlee s scrawl no 1 , which owes something to pollock in his predrip period as a rule , the more eclectic the work , the more likely it is to catch the eye two cases in point are the untitled images of geoffrey detrani and john rosis , the first of which is a collection of six squares , each a shiny , ivorycolored tile embossed with a dab or two of whiter impasto the second consists of ellipses drawn in black oil stick on a ground upholstered with a paper collage in various tones of white noticeable , too , are meredy van syckle s acrylics on paper , especially the one featuring a cascade of freely drawn circles and ovals on a creamy ground the smaller shapes are generally outlined in black and filled with solid color the largest , rimmed in gray , is filled with blue spots bendel hydes s attack has the same bravura , but the artist stays the course , filling the canvas with a dribbled stain of sour green and adding a host of bright blue button shapes then , at the bottom , the painter inserts a bollardlike shape outlined with ropes of white and crisscrossed with thicker ropes in bright colors that dribble the image may be handsome or hideous , i could not decide , yet either way it has panache and is hard to forget meet and mingle , by cynthia smith , is a tall canvas filled with a pale yellow shape , the sum of many small ovals laid end to end on a dark green background with a texture like parsley there is a cartoonlike humor about the image , which evokes the work of carroll dunham , but only for a few moments , because ms smith paints precisely , uses no lines and manages to invest the picture with a landscape quality grid designs , stretches of uninflected color , expressionistic compositions with figural intimations , reliefs this is quite a crowd it is possible that the curators made their choices without always bearing in mind the narrowness of the space in which they were to be displayed when the corridor is filled with theater patrons on their way to and from the auditorium , it seems likely that none by the myopic can see the art , let alone register the power of its color and form this brings up the question of the show s purpose that art must educate or die , a rule that viewers must learn to live with \( or die \) , and ms freedman takes it pretty literally , providing an abc of abstract art that she calls a primer for children of all ages , but aims at the youngest of them during the 1930 s , andre malraux instigated late hours at the louvre in the hope of acquainting french workers with high art , only to find that most of them came to see the mona lisa one can only wish ms freedman and all other missionaries success in their task , for abstraction , though a force in western art for almost a century , has yet to bring the mass of the people to its feet the show continues through may 2 the paramount center for the arts is at 1008 brown street , and the number to call for information is 7392333 photos from driven to abstraction at the paramount scrawl no 1 by don wunderlee , above left meredy van syckle s untitled , above right , and , untitled 3 by bendel hydes
in the mutual fund business , banks are the alsorans throughout the 1980 s and 90 s , as longtime depositors have fled in search of higher returns , banks have taken only the most elementary steps toward building competitive fund groups plenty have tried , of course most notably , the mellon bank corporation bought the dreyfus family of funds in 1994 , immediately placing the pittsburgh bank in the lead among bank fund companies but with mellon still struggling to incorporate that mutual fund group into its overall strategy , the venture cannot be labeled a success among the handful of banks that have made a name for themselves in the fund business is the chase manhattan corporation , parent of the vista capital family of stock and bond funds while chase s goals remain similar to those of several other big bank companies expand the fund business overseas , sell more aggressively in the united states and build a stable of topperforming managers its vista group has been different in one important way its performance record has been good enough to attract money through financial advisers , one of the most soughtafter groups because they increasingly control investment dollars now , however , on the eve of chase s 13 billion merger with the chemical banking corporation , whose additional fund assets will vault vista to near the top of the bank fund groups , the company runs the risk of alienating many customers last year , only three of vista s 12 funds ranked in the top 25 percent of all funds in performance , and according to one industry expert , vista gained almost no assets through new sales in addition , chase must overcome what has been a persistent obstacle to growth for bank funds disenchanted consumers who have experienced many big bank mergers and who have come to view their banks as a necessary evil , rather than as the answer to their investment needs to leonard m spalding jr , president of vista , all those challenges come down to one basic strategy our plan is to hire and retain the best managers we can , he said and i 'll make sure we do that we are not going to put up with a lot of extended third and fourthquartile performance his statement hints of some significant changes ahead for the vista group , far beyond the already difficult task of merging two fund families vista and chemical s much smaller hanover group and associated backoffice systems and cultures industry analysts leave no doubt that mr spalding has his work cut out for him if the new chase intends to be a player in the mutual fund industry , they have got to step up and aggressively promote these funds , and find an additional flagship fund or two that will attract assets , said jeff lovell , a partner at putnam lovell thornton , a fund advisory and investment banking firm right now , i do n't think they have the investment record even after chase and chemical consummate their 13 billion merger next week , creating the country s largest bank , vista will rank no better than 29th among mutual fund companies , the biggest of which is fidelity investments when you consider that we came from no 129 a few years ago , we 're coming along pretty well , mr spalding said which is not to say that he is content by next year , he expects vista s assets under management to grow to 25 billion , from about 17 billion now , a growth rate one and a half times that of the mutual fund industry as a whole all of that , he asserts , will come from new fund sales , not from market gains and if most of it occurs in vista s stock and bond funds , as mr spalding hopes , vista s assets there could more than double in part , vista aims to expand by establishing agreements to sell funds overseas , where the company can use the chase manhattan name in the united states , to avoid customer confusion about what is covered by deposit insurance , fund companies owned by banks cannot use the bank s name in fund titles but much more of the growth potential lies at home , where consumers have made mutual funds their favorite savings vehicle like that of most bank fund companies , the bulk of vista s assets lie in money market funds , a lowmargin and less stable segment of the business money market funds , in fact , are about all that chemical bank will contribute to vista in the merger of chemical s 72 billion in fund assets , less than 500 million is in stock and bond funds chase has nearly 4 billion in stock and bond funds , about 38 percent of its 101 billion in total funds , according to the financial research corporation , a chicago company that tracks fund assets mr spalding is counting on much of those money market assets to migrate to stock and bond funds , which contribute more to the bottom line much of vista s marketing will be aimed at bank customers particularly chemical depositors , who made little use of the company s hanover stock and bond funds the hanover funds will be merged into vista s funds , subject to a shareholder vote scheduled for april 2
graceland going home with elvis by karal ann marling illustrated 258 pp cambridge , mass harvard university press 2495 everything about elvis presley feels preprogrammed by prophets the anagram of the name elvis lives \( nobody ever seems to remark that you can make levis or evils out of it too \) the legendary birth , in a shanty on the wrong side of not one but two railroad lines in tupelo , miss elvis aron and his rhyming older twin , jesse garon but jesse was born dead , buried in a shoebox tied with a red ribbon that made elvis the second coming later , the flight into egypt the family s night drive to memphis the city at the head of the mississippi delta running away , karal ann marling speculates , from his father vernon presley s failure in a bootleg venture it s his beatification as a secular saint that makes elvis interesting , more than his brief career as a genuinely gifted singer and sex idol before he was remanufactured by rca and hollywood acolytes and elvis widows make pilgrimages , collect relics , report posthumous sightings like christ , he s called the king presley himself sometimes lived as if he were fulfilling a prophecy that nobody but he had heard he began reshaping himself while still in his teens , wearing mascara and maybe eye shadow , dying his hair jet black later he dressed like a cartoon superhero ms marling describes the byronic splendor of his final las vegas incarnation he was legendary , biblical , gorgeous , godlike , a mortal man transfigured by the radiance of a pure white jumpsuit swathed in pearls and ropes of gold the vegas act was pure ritual variety called it kabuki drama graceland going home with elvis is a meditation on presley as a cultural phenomenon ms marling , a professor of art history and american studies at the university of minnesota , seeks to understand him by exploring the places where he lived the dwellings range from the birthplace in tupelo , a tworoom shotgun house built by vernon presley , all the way up the ladder of success to the celestial hilltop memphis mansion of graceland presley liked to point out that the tupelo house would fit comfortably in graceland s living room he thus executed a neat oedipal reversal of the biblical in my father s house are many mansions graceland today is the secondmostvisited private home in america \( after the white house \) its name is yet another religious echo , although grace was only the original owner s aunt the house was built in 1939 its white columns , ms marling believes , were the product of a tara craze that followed the release of gone with the wind ms marling finds other fascinating parallels in 1957 , the same year presley was moving into graceland , for example , william faulkner , not far away in mississippi , was typing his novel the mansion , one of whose characters is the appalling redneck flem snopes snopes asserts his status by enlarging his house with twostory colyums , crams the interior with sweets of furniture bought in memphis , then sits home at night alone with his feet propped on a piece of scrap lumber nailed to his white mount vernonstyle mantel alas , today s pilgrims do n't quite receive the full pungent blast of presley s graceland his former wife , priscilla , regained command after his death and chose to polish the reputation of the deceased , as ms marling puts it in other words , she toned things down blue , for instance , replaced red presley shared with flem snopes the lack of a rich tradition to help him imagine how to achieve happiness and status through expenditure he could have toured the world , collected art , financed charities , hunted big game , been a patron of architecture , cultivated the great none of those options were available to his imagination elvis could think of only three things to buy , and all were the kind of merchandise you can see in store windows clothes , cars and furniture there was the solid gold cadillac , the body of which glowed with 40 coats of handrubbed pearlized finish made of crushed diamonds and fish scales from the orient , ms marling writes in an apparent lapse of skepticism there were those whiteonwhite kabukimeetsnapoleon outfits as for furniture , presley loved it so much that his mother , gladys , hoped he 'd eventually give up show biz and open a furniture store ms marling is at her best tracing the sources of presley s tastes in acquisition she knows her way around the nashville countrymusic scene , the celebrity mansions of bel air , the hipster clothing outlets of memphis she evokes role models of conspicuous consumption like hank williams and liberace , who like presley knew they were thumbing their noses at good taste , but did so with more humor she trolls the homedecor magazines of the 1950 s , reminding us of superlength white sofas , the furniture equivalent of a debutante s gloves she notes the era s fad for gendered space , like the den of the family dad presley memorably realized that image in his amazing jungle room because graceland was constantly being furnished and refurnished , it could register the trends of pop culture as quickly and superficially as the flicker of a television screen the mansion s most vivid era , ms marling thinks , derived from the psychedelic colors and art nouveau shapes of acidrock posters presley hung out amid all this scenic splendor with a retinue of the guys uncles , gofers , school pals living , both at graceland and in a series of rented hollywood pads , like a teenager whose parents are n't home , in one of ms marling s typically deft phrases sometimes he 'd put a bullet through a television screen when he saw an image he disliked , for instance that of robert goulet or of mel torme graceland is filled with the rich madness of life the author s tone , though , can sometimes be a problem her voice is hip , knowing , flippant , a voice that falls somewhere between tom wolfe and erma bombeck she treats presley s life as a text we already know , a familiar film for which she s supplying a vivid , amused voiceover commentary it s an approach that tends to celebrate ms marling while devaluing presley sometimes ms marling plays a double game , ridiculing elvis and his circle as clowns while damning the rest of us as snobs for not appreciating him she s capable of complaining about cultural stereotyping at the very moment she s practicing it , as in to the designated culture barons of uptown manhattan , elvis remained a sloeeyed barbarian from dixie with something dangerous stuffed in his pants the only winner here is the author the authorial voice goes especially sour in the last chapter , when ms marling emerges from behind her commentator persona and takes center stage , filling us in on her grandfather , southern food , tom arnold and roseanne , and whatever else crosses her mind her final paragraph is a hackneyed classic of selfindulgence now , i thought about elvis and graceland and grampa and gatsby and home in the dark at the back of the van , with minneapolis all aglow like oz on the horizon up ahead , with memphis back there someplace in the void beyond the rearview mirror , i cried for all of us grampa and grandma gatsby pawpaw for poor roseanne and love gone wrong for o j for elvis , bless his heart and for me scratch that but not the book graceland most of it is as pleasing as a new pair of blue suede shoes drawing

a professional inline skater from switzerland is decked out in pure grunge , looking a lot like the similarly grungy local teenagers milling around he is wearing baggy shorts to the knees , a tshirt that says man skating on the back and a gold loop in his left ear if this were a soundgarden concert , he 'd be one of the fans listening from the mosh pit it s not exactly the typical image of newport , with its elite history of yachting gentlemen and socialregister matrons but espn s twoyearold , madefortelevision x games have definitely hewn out a place in rhode island s summer landscape as well as on the television screens of the mtv generation this is , after all , an international sporting event with 302 , 000 in prize money , and 40 hours of broadcast time on espn and espn2 it s part of the charm of the event , said 23yearold amy cacciola , an espn spokeswoman who worked on the x games last summer newport has culture , old money , mansions and all that and then we bring in all this crazy stuff with 402 athletes , including 64 women , in nine disciplines , the participants are into serious competition even if none of them seems much interested in conventional sports the average age is 21 , but some are as young as 12 and have never been away from home i think these kids have grown up with baseball and soccer , and i think they 've just had it , cacciola said they 're looking for excitement , and part of that excitement is that they like to make people think it s more dangerous than it is only an adventure race took place outside rhode island it was a 348mile stage competition that started in raquette lake , ny , and made its way by canoe , bike , raft and hike to finish in newport today the weeklong x games end sunday the rest of the x games are played at five rhode island sites within a 40mile radius of newport , including downtown providence but the core disciplines bicycle stunt racing , inline skating and skateboarding are centered on newport s historic waterfront , along the newport yachting center the organizers refer to the core sports as the heart and soul of their event just 20 feet from the docks is a street course positioned with manmade obstacles including rails , box jumps and halfpipes competitors in all three core events perform on the street course on the opposite side of a grandstand is the granddaddy of halfpipes , a bowed plywood structure that is 11 feet high and 42 feet wide gliding up one side and down the other are the athletes who , through a combination of intricate acrobatics , strive to propel themselves beyond the coping , or upper edges of the halfpipe it is subjective , marcos langares said about the scoring a member of the fourman rollerblade team from europe , the 24yearold spaniard added it will always be like that but that is the beautiful part , too you never know what s going to happen the dayandnight action is captured by a moving camera suspended from a cable that extends from the top of the threestory newport post office , across four traffic lanes and a treelined divider on america s cup avenue , down to the docks scores of gawkers line city sidewalks normally filled with tourists interested in newport s more traditional attractions at espn s inaugural event last summer , more than 130 , 000 people attended , 70 percent of whom were from rhode island the site was more remote then , sequestered out of town at a 19th century fort that had no inhouse running water or electricity also within the cable camera s viewfinder this year is a sport climbing area where two towers have been built with walls made of resin and sand plates attached to pipe framing the larger of the two , the 60foot tower , is made for the speed event , in which the quickest climber to reach the top wins a 40foot tower demands more methodical climbing as competitors claw their way under and up a 20foot overhang within the providence city limits , the streetluge course runs downhill at the college hill area at brown university an event similar to luge in the winter olympics , these luge sleds are boards with wheels that run along streets lined with hay bales the skysurfing event is located at second beach , a long , wide spit of oceanfront in middletown , just outside the newport city limits the bungee jumpers fall from a 155foot tower in waterplace park , a downtown esplanade in providence the wakeboarding and barefoot jumping competitions are on a small manmade lake at roger williams park in providence despite the erstwhile extreme name given to these events , the athletes seem unimpressed it is more dangerous to drive a car , langares said , well , look at us , we 've been doing this a long time photo dennis mccoy pedaling skyward in the x games bicycle competitionon monday in newport , ri \( associated press \)
to the editor i share the concern over the closing of circle rep and what it portends for future writers , directors , actors and designers i am disturbed , however , that none of these obituaries takes a wider view the neighborhood economic benefits of off broadway have been well documented even more to the point , besides the loss for the audience , of course , is the plight of the people who work offstage in marketing , bookkeeping , fundraising , the box office , casting and artsineducation when a closing theater is afflicted with financial problems , it means that former staff members may be owed back salary these people may still be struggling to reimburse family and friends and pay credit cards maxed out to meet living expenses when their paychecks could not be cashed theater , like any nonprofit organization , is an enterprise books must balance , payroll must be met and vendors paid doing this was something which circle rep was never any good at , as tanya berezin , the company s former artistic director , acknowledges it is easy to be blinded by the romance of live theater the nostalgic tone of sylviane gold s article is proof of that in the years ahead , the best nonprofits , including theaters , will accept the financial realities of their situation let s hope that this more realistic perspective will be complemented by more thoughtful newspaper coverage george m worthington new york the writer is the former director of circle rep s annual fund
freehold sevenyearold amy remite did gymnastics for four years but got bored she did soccer , too , which was just all right but two months ago , she became hooked on one of the fastestgrowing sports for children dressage it may seem counterintuitive that a generation of children who are rollerblading , riding mountain bikes and bungeejumping would go for a precise equestrian sport that some find people find about as exciting as watching grass grow but dressage \( pronounced drehsahzh , from the french word for training \) is nothing if not challenging it requires sangfroid , upright posture and a lexicon of terms like piaffe , pas de deux and passage \( which rhymes with dressage \) yet in the last few years , more and more people under 18 have been signing up , lured in part by the challenge to do something different , in part by changes that have made the sport more simple and fun and parents like what they see , saying dressage can foster discipline , respect and hard work dressage is not a group sport , said jeannine anderson , whose 8yearold daughter , suzanne , has been taking lessons at los alamos dressage center here for about a year it s a oneonone sport that s like a chess game , where you learn not just how to ride but how to train the horse , trying to get two minds working as one it never ends , and it s always a challenge the growth in dressage for children has been impressive nationwide , subscriptions to dressage connection , a newsletter of the united states dressage federation for riders aged 7 to 21 , have more than tripled , to 3 , 200 , since it started four years ago in new jersey , trainers say there are a few hundred young riders , up from almost none a decade ago dressage participants in an annual competition sponsored by the new jersey region pony club , for instance , jumped by more than 60 percent , to 136 , from 1992 to 1995 , according to barbara fusi , a past regional supervisor of the club not that dressage is about to eclipse gymnastics , soccer or ballet it is not popular yet with boys , though one of the state s top young riders is michael shondel , 13 , of kinnelon it is also mainly for the welltodo , requiring access to horse farms and money 25 to 50 for a halfhour lesson , hundreds of dollars for boots and other equipment , and , if one wants to get serious about competition , 10 , 000 and up for one s own horse even so , children keep coming , and they keep getting younger and younger , some as young as 5 or 6 last week , several girls aged 7 to 17 practiced the basics here making the horse undulate , not bounce adjusting the saddle so that one s back remains straight some students practiced any number of precise patterns , which , when mastered by their horses , will enable the student to move up a level , as with the kata system and colored belts of karate dressage is usually safe , for the horse does not jump over fences , as scarlett o'hara s daughter tragically did in gone with the wind it can be frustrating , though , and it is hard work the students' thighs are sore , their forearms taut this is not a country ride , said bernardo vergara , head trainer of the hillsborough equestrian center when i tell you we need to correct this problem , and it s going to take a couple of years , it s a big challenge those who are good and it usually takes years of practice can make the horse look as if it were dancing on air it s like gymnastics for a horse , or figure skating , said gail hoffcarmona , owner of the los alamos dressage center , which was founded in 1966 as the country s first dressage school but as at all of the dozen or so other dressagetraining farms now in operation , she saw no interest among young students until a few years ago there are several reasons for the rise in interest , trainers say the tests have been simplified to encourage more levels of competition music accompaniment , everything from classical to swing and rockandroll and even bagpipes , has been added to competitions , as in figure skating and there are more entertaining kinds of dressage , like the pas de deux and the quadrille , which require two and four horses , respectively , to move in unison \( think synchronized swimming , but on piggyback \) another reason is the recent success of united states equestrian team , whose headquarters are in gladstone the team won a bronze in the dressage competition at the 1992 barcelona olympics , and hopes are high for atlanta despite stiff competition from the perennial favorite , germany the selection trials will take place next weekend and the weekend after and will include a musical freestyle event for the first time some traditionalists , partial to german and european training techniques , believe the sport is being compromised by the added entertainment and the increasing participation of children there are concerns about safety , too , though it is unusual for a horse to buck a rider but robin gifford , executive director of the united states dressage federation , in lincoln , neb , says it makes sense to americanize the sport to broaden dressage s appeal and others say that children can gain more than just a love of horses when i first got here two years ago , i totally wanted to avoid it because i was afraid , said arpita panday , 13 , of freehold but this has been great it helps you build up

one hundred years ago today c vols and 36 , 484 nos ago the newyork times brought forth an edition of 12 pages , the fourth of which carried a oneparagraph announcement that adolph s ochs of chattanooga , tenn , had become publisher and general manager of that moribund newspaper the modest notice sat atop the day s only signed article , an editorial credo expressing ochs s earnest aim to give the news concisely , clearly , promptly and impartially , without fear or favor reading through that first ochs times shows it to have been a pledge worthy of many a century s labor consider concisely a bright ambition to this day the times has surely improved somewhat on the lead article of aug 19 , 1896 it ran to 4 , 000 words , atop a speech text of 10 , 000 more , filling three columns on page 1 , all seven columns on page 2 , and two more columns on page 3 , in a type no larger than the modern stock market listings the headline read thousands hear w bourke cockran cockran being a goldvoiced orator whose assault on the freesilver doctrines of william jennings bryan caused madison square garden to ring with a burst of patriotic enthusiasm consider clearly ochs must have sensed that a few of his 9 , 000 readers were wondering who this cockran was a competing daily implied that he was a former member of congress , but the times , observing that he drew an audience of 10 , 000 new yorkers , wasted none of its words on any further identification giving news promptly was , of course , the essence of newspapering in that telegraphic era the top of ochs s first front page was full of fresh occurrences , from the preparations for a sanguinary encounter in lexington , ky , to resolve a charge that the society editor of an unnamed newspaper , mrs eugenie dunlap potts , had composed a slanderous forgery , to the death at southsea , england , during the royal albert regatta , of baron von zedtwitz , whose isolde was rammed by the meteor , a yacht owned by the baron s friend , emperor wilhelm of germany even more prompt was that madison square garden coverage , which must have kept reporters running well past midnight but ochs s most famous pledge , to give the news impartially , probably rattled a staff expecting praise for its account of how cockran disposed of bryan s socalled arguments no more impartially , the paper s offlead that morning dwelt on bryan s denial that he was , or ever had been , in the pay of the silver mines his statement was obtained in upper red hook , ny , where he caught not a fish , while mrs bryan covered herself with glory by making the only catches of the entire party to be sure , ochs s credo that first day also promised to intensify , if possible , the times s devotion to the cause of sound money that cause was dear to all 15 of new york s englishlanguage dailies except the journal , recently bought by william randolph hearst with money decidedly traceable to his father s silver mines intensely devoted indeed was the rest of ochs s first opinion page separate editorials observed that bryan s silver dollar was now worth a mere 51 and onesixth cents that the populists' backing of unsound money at the democratic national convention amounted to party treason that the boy orator had been flattened at the garden by the man orator and would be very ill advised to again face an audience in this part of the 'enemy s country' and in a final note bryan s garble of scripture raised a painful suspicion that he does not know much more about his bible than he does about bimetallism still , by the journalistic standards of the day , the times was certainly restrained its impartiality , then as now , was obviously a relative virtue , anchored in the prevailing values of patriotic , affluent and educated readers for whom ochs was planning not just all the news fit to print but only such as does not soil the breakfast cloth consider the coverage on aug 19 , 1896 , by other serious journals bryanism riddled , shouted the sun , the boy orator unmasked its opening paragraph celebrated cleareyed thinkers come to the garden to protest against dragging the good flag of democracy in the mire of populism the newyork tribune read cockran replies to bryan the boy orator demolished an exhaustive and eloquent exposure of the populist conspiracy \( imagine a press so bold as to instantly proclaim the winner of a political debate ! \) the evening post found ways to dump on bryan in all three categories of frontpage news the main local article reported the arrival at the waldorf hotel of mark hanna , the chairman of the republican national committee , full of praise for the cockran speech the national lead predicted on the very best authority that president grover cleveland would support the thirdparty ticket of hardmoney democrats the foreign lead strained to find no sympathy for mr bryan s theories in europe by comparison , the times , if not yet wholly impartial , was certainly tame and temperate the two dozen brief articles that lay scattered on page 1 between bryan and the baron told of tragedies and disasters that would have nourished a modern tabloid for a month
blood sport the president and his adversaries by james b stewart illustrated 479 pp new york simon schuster 25 in the annals of greed and easy credit , few land purchases look dumber in retrospect than the one that closed at the citizens bank and trust company in the town of flippin , ark , at 10 am on aug 2 , 1978 it was dumb because much of the 230 acres was brushcovered and inaccessible by road because only part of it fronted on the white river , which was its sole attraction because the price of 203 , 000 was double what its sellers had agreed to pay for it only months earlier because the entire purchase price was borrowed and the loan would have to be repaid or refinanced at the end of six months because even a quick resale of the 44 projected lots promised at best a modest profit because interest rates were about to go through the roof because the principal active partner , james mcdougal , had the attention span of a rat terrier and because the principal passive partner , hillary rodham , was married to a man she expected to be president someday the fateful die had been cast one evening in a little rock restaurant called the blackeyed pea when ms rodham and her husband , bill clinton , who was running for governor of arkansas that summer , chanced upon their friends jim mcdougal and his wife , susan mr mcdougal was full of excitement about the piece of land he 'd just seen he invited the clintons to join him in the deal no money necessary , he 'd take care of everything mr clinton and his wife were both graduates of the yale law school , but they might have been rubes at a country fair they said they 'd love to go in on the deal the clintons have now had 18 years to reflect on all the omens of failure that should have been obvious from the beginning their sole motive was hope of a quick buck they knew nothing about real estate or land development or the financial strength of their partners they never saw the land they were buying , never met the bankers lending them the money , did not attend the closing , had no money to pay back the loan if it was called and were potentially liable for the whole of the borrowed sum plus interest in the event that the project failed and their partners were broke the history of this illconceived and highly speculative enterprise , formally known as the whitewater development company inc , comes to splendid life in one of the best books on american politics in recent years , james b stewart s blood sport the president and his adversaries mr stewart was invited to undertake the book in march 1994 by susan thomases , a friend of mrs clinton who plays an occasional role in the story herself but after one 90minute meeting with mr stewart , mrs clinton apparently changed her mind , saw him no more and , according to recent washington rumor , has been biting her nails in nervous anticipation of what mr stewart will say it is not hard to see why she is worried hillary rodham clinton is at or close to the center of every episode gathered under the big tent called whitewater she supported the original whitewater investment and tenaciously held on to the clinton family half for 14 years with the help of an arkansas friend , she turned 1 , 000 into nearly 100 , 000 in less than a year trading cattle futures , then sought refuge behind the claim , ridiculous on its face , that she had made all her own buy and sell orders , basing them on her reading of the wall street journal as a partner in the prestigious rose law firm of little rock she represented the savingsandloan bank owned by mr mcdougal , which went bust in 1989 , costing the taxpayers 68 million she brought her close friend and rose partner vincent foster to washington , and after he committed suicide she was suspected of ending up in possession of whitewater files that had been in foster s office when he died an attempt to fire the seven employees of the white house travel office and give the business to a clinton crony is said to have been prompted by mrs clinton s demand that the job slots be made available for our people about all of these matters mrs clinton and people speaking for her have said things that are thickly defended by lawyerly constructions like as best i can recall bill clinton has weathered his share of hard questions about the past in the 1992 presidential primaries he was nearly knocked out by a onetwo combination of tabloid sleaze involving , first , his alleged little rock girlfriend gennifer flowers and , second , a painfully extended deconstruction of his explanation of how he avoided the draft during the vietnam war but mr clinton s reputation as a screwup is cast into shadow by the chain of troubles centering on mrs clinton , which mr stewart lays before us in gripping detail , and the portrait of her character that emerges in blood sport is a troubling one in their single meeting mr stewart found mrs clinton an attractive person , vital and lively , and many others say much the same but her responses to the public s questions about her motives and behavior reveal a closed , secretive and rigid personality william safire , a columnist for this newspaper , has called mrs clinton a congenital liar , and she has certainly made some statements that seem conspicuously unsupported by the available evidence the denial , for example , that she took more than a passing interest in the travel office affair the denial that she ever did much legal work for mr mcdougal s bank the assertion \( soon dropped \) that she made all that money in cattle futures without help but to label these claims lies is to miss the character trait that appears to inspire them mrs clinton seems to have carried into adult life the world view of a little girl determined to be perfect she did not spill the milk the cat spilled the milk , her friend spilled the milk , the milk only looks spilled , it is not actually milk with each question and response the jaw clenches tighter and the lips draw thinner
washington , march 19 the house passed a bill today to have the government reimburse legal expenses of the seven employees dismissed from the white house travel office in may 1993 the republican measure was approved 35043 it would pay billy dale , the dismissed office director , and his former colleagues , who were let go by the clinton white house , such sums as are necessary to cover their legal costs nothing will ever really compensate these individuals for what they 've been through , the bill s author , representative william clinger , republican of pennsylvania , said before the vote mr dale has said the legal bills for the seven employees totaled more than 400 , 000 a version of the legislation pending in the senate would reimburse mr dale only , up to 424 , 000 a federal jury acquitted mr dale last year on embezzlement charges none of the others were tried five were rehired in government and one retired the white house has said president clinton would sign the legislation mr dale told reporters today that he hoped passage of the measure would end his family s ordeal i hope it s the end of it , he said my wife and i just want to get on with our lives republicans have accused the white house of sacking the employees and prompting an fbi investigation of them in order to staff the travel office with friends of the president and hillary rodham clinton administration officials cited mismanagement in the travel office as behind the firings but have conceded the episode was mishandled
this is what i carry with me donna mckechnie stands in a manhattan sublet apartment surrounded by someone else s possessions , cradling a picture frame in it is a photograph , taken 20 years ago , of her between michael bennett and fred astaire he had come to see 'a chorus line' in la and he took us to dinner at trader vic s , she recalled i could n't speak i was so in awe then we went back to his house , and when i used the powder room , the initial p was on the hand towels , for phyllis , his dead wife this was before he got married again and i thought 'he s living in a time warp he s lonely' i remember him saying , 'i do n't go out much anymore because of all the husbands tapping me on the shoulder asking , 'will you dance with my wife \? ' and when we were leaving , i thought 'this is terrible he s going to think i'm just a stupid dancer who ca n't speak' we got in the car , and i looked back to wave there was a porch with a light over it and a circular drive and when i waved , you know what he did \? he went like this she strikes the classic fred astaire pose , a lunge with arms extended it was his signature to me saying it s ok , she said he knew it s odd , suddenly , to see her imitate his pose here she has been on this rainy afternoon , dressed in an argyle sweater set and slacks , making homey chatter , setting out ice cubes in a bowl and to see that pose transform this woman who looks like a mom in a cookie commercial into one of the most commanding musicalcomedy dancers of our time is jarring but donna mckechnie has always been a study in opposites , especially when she dances , her stark physical power contrasting with her littlegirl ebullience the pure line of an artist suffused by the pure ecstasy of snoopy anticipating his supper there is also the enduring offstage dichotomy the cassie thing star , not a star famous , but only to other dancers acting out her own life onstage , except for the fact that the cassie character in a chorus line , for which she won a tony award in 1976 , was never based on her life the character of maggie was , but who remembers maggie \? so , even though she never was cassie , everyone thinks she is maybe it s a way to keep michael bennett alive he was her friend , director , choreographer and , briefly , husband , who died of aids in 1987 from the moment they met on the television show hullabaloo , she was his premier interpreter she was not just a michael bennett dancer , she was the michael bennett dancer which helps to answer the whateverhappenedto \? question that has plagued her ever since but more of that later this month she has returned to broadway for the first time since 1987 , her final stint in a chorus line she is costarring with john davidson , kathryn crosby and andrea mcardle in rodgers and hammerstein s state fair , directed by james hammerstein and randy skinner , opening on wednesday at the music box theater ms mckechnie plays emily arden , a bigband singer and dancer hellbent on getting to new york and becoming a star while the role is not quite cassie , there is that same wish behind it , that same yearning for a name in lights the musical , which was written in 1945 as a film , began touring last summer in des moines to coincide with the iowa state fair , for which it is named and in this year of the surprise hit movie babe , no one should underestimate the pull of a story that revolves around a farmer s blueribbon hopes for his prize pig i call it the humanscale show , ms mckechnie said it lets people feel you 're like them or they 're like you and they 're not alone the tour of state fair ended only a month ago , which partly explains why ms mckechnie is living in a friend s apartment on the upper west side her life has truly been that of a gypsy since her marriage to bennett ended in 1977 though she continued to live in new york , it was impossible , she recalled , to find work i had a very tough time after the relationship , she said i could n't get an audition for a year i heard the rumor about michael blackballing me , but i never thought that was true it was never personal none of michael bennett s business partners wanted to make him uncomfortable by casting me she moved to los angeles in 1980 , she said , to establish her tvq , or television quotient , which meant that if you became a tv star , you could come back to new york and get a broadway show while she stayed for 10 years , appearing on sitcoms such as family ties , even coaching the los angeles raiders cheerleaders \( i had a manager who wanted tickets to the games , she said , laughing do n't ask \) , she ended up touring in musical theater most of that time i never stopped working above the title , she said i just was not visible in new york i was better known in london , paris , tokyo i did n't feel i dropped out of sight but the perception here was that no one could ever find me in 1992 she moved back to new york , appearing in cut the ribbons , a fast flop cast in a leading role in the 1993 off broadway annie warbucks , the disappointing sequel to annie , her dream of a long run was dashed again with state fair , she hopes to be luckier she 'd like an apartment and a country house i miss a yard , she said simply
hartsdale the rev rayner \( rusty \) hesse likes to tell people he is bivocational and he gets even more of a kick out of their reactions when they learn the two vocations are episcopal priest and dealer of antiques and collectibles yet the professions are not so different as one might think the confessions mr hesse hears in memory lane , his store here , often require tact and compassion from the listener to be sure , customers come in daily looking for no more than a beautiful piece of furniture or a fascinating old bauble , but there are also those who arrive bearing objects that they are parting with only as a last resort those who must literally sell their grandmother s silver or father s antique golf clubs or mother s cameo pendant in order to pay bills , or rent , or taxes some , mr hesse said , show up with tears streaming down their faces on a recent afternoon he pointed out a round diningroom table , circa 1900 , made of solidlooking oak last year , shortly before april 15 , a young couple came to him and said they had no money to pay their income taxes it s what they were eating off of , but they had to sell it , mr hesse recalled we bought it from them for close to what we are selling it for the price tag on the table reads 500 mr hesse also showed a visitor two crystal lamps with lusters , which he is selling for 550 for the pair not long ago they belonged to an elderly woman living in a big house when she sold the place to move to a smaller home , she had to sell most of the things in it in order to pay a capitalgains tax we hear a lot of sad stories because we get called in when people are in trouble , and because we handle estate sales when there has been a death , mr hesse said objects can hold tremendous meaning they hold so many memories for people we understand why they are hard to part with so we like to think that by acquiring , displaying and possibly selling an object , we give it a new phase , a continued life , in a sense mr hesse , who is 40 , always knew he wanted to be a priest ordained at 26 , he served full time at st john s in getty square in yonkers , then at st andrew s episcopal church in hartsdale during those years he helped found a number of organizations for the needy , including food patch , coalition for the homeless and the sharing community but several years ago , he began feeling a need to take a break from the fulltime ministry and the intense demands of socialservice work , and he sought a parttime position at st john s wilmot , the tiny , 20member congregation in new rochelle where he now preaches he also realized he wanted equity a place of my own and decided to start a business based on his lifelong love of searching for and finding beautiful and unusual things in 1992 , he opened memory lane these days , the store hold thousands of objects ranging from 50 cent paperback books to a 10 , 000 hepplewhite sideboard in addition to keeping regular store hours on wednesdays , fridays and saturdays from 10 am to 5 pm and thursdays and sundays from noon to 5 pm \( he preaches sunday mornings \) , he holds auctions at a storefront he recently leased at the white plains mall on hamilton avenue in white plains on friday nights he also handles the disposition of estates , wherein , he said , we do everything from literally cleaning out the refrigerator to moving and selling the furniture these can yield surprises , some of which , mr hesse said , are real treasures in one house , buried deep in a closet , he found a pair of diamond earrings wrapped in tissue paper stuffed into an empty sucrets box hidden in the toe of a shoe while going through another house , his workers discovered valuable memorabilia from the 1939 and 1964 world s fairs and in yet another home , 27 , 000 was found wedged under a floorboard along with the cremated remains of a family member all money , of course , is returned to the owner s relatives or heirs , but most of the objects found during estate searches wind up in the store or on the auction block in the shop , mr hesse has china , crystal , glassware , sterling silver , furniture , lamps , lace , linens , costume jewelry , dolls , old pens , campaign buttons , sheet music , perfume bottles some still filled with perfume and hundreds of other items one corner is even devoted to angels little sculptures , decoupage boxes and needlepoint cushions with cherub motifs , candles with wax molded into sweetlooking faces and shoulders sprouting wings mr hesse insists that these have nothing to do with his religious activities , explaining that angels are highly collectible right now a similar variety is available at auction on a recent night , mr hesse himself auctioned 115 items , including dozens of old bottles , a strand of sparkling jet beads and a sterling baby cup engraved with the name grace , which caused one woman to say , i wonder what grace was like and where she is now mr hesse spoke quickly , but with none of the hard edge of the typical auctioneer , and always with a smile on his face and a touch of humor in his voice it was easy to imagine him behind the pulpit , delivering some nonjudgmental sermon he s creative , said rosemarie wildulski , a travel agent and collector he has a pleasant way about him he also has something of a following people who hear him preach are curious to know what he sounds like selling , and vice versa word of the preacherantiques dealerauctioneer has spread through hartsdale , scarsdale and beyond many customers know he is a priest before they walk in the door of memory lane some , in fact , say they feel particularly comfortable buying from and selling to him , believing that he not only adheres to the ethics of the trade but also answers to a higher authority i heard about him through someone in my parish , said jeanne stapleton smith , who had come to the shop from her home in white plains to buy gifts for friends it s fascinating that he is a priest and a businessman , and that so many people know of him it seems that everyone has heard of rusty photos the rev rayner \( rusty \) hesse auctioning off a

washington , nov 17 federal authorities have arrested a career employee of the central intelligence agency on charges of passing highly classified information to russia for several years , lawenforcement officials said tonight the officials said the cia employee was arrested on saturday in virginia after what they called one of the most important and tightly controlled espionage investigations during the clinton administration the officials said that the nature of the information passed on was not yet clear but that they suspected the employee had had access to an array of security information about the former eastern bloc they said that the case had caused high anxiety in the senior ranks of the cia and that they regarded espionage by a career official with access to closely guarded secrets as extremely damaging and potentially embarrassing the employee , whose identity was not disclosed , is scheduled to appear on monday before a federal magistrate in alexandria , va the officials said he had been an instructor who trained other officials of the agency and had been stationed overseas in recent months , they said , he had been reassigned to the agency s counterterrorism unit to limit his access to classified materials the espionage attributed to the employee began at least as early as 1994 , but officials said it was possible that the employee had been recruited earlier by russia , possibly before the collapse of the eastern bloc in 1991 , although the precise period was uncertain the case appears to be the second time a career cia employee has been accused of spying for russia the other case involved aldrich h ames , a counterintelligence officer who sold the soviet union the identities of more than a dozen soviet and eastern bloc officials who were passing secrets to the united states mr ames pleaded guilty to espionage and is serving a life sentence the officials were reluctant to compare the latest case to the ames case the possibility that the soviet kgb or the intelligence agencies that had succeeded it after the cold war had penetrated the cia beyond mr ames has been hotly debated in spy circles but it was not until the arrest this weekend that the existence of another mole had ever been more than theoretical possibility it was not clear how long the official arrested over the weekend had been suspected or how the authorities had obtained the information they used to make the case against him the accusations underscored how the relaxation of cold war tensions had not ended the competition between old adversaries last week , a spy case against a former russian intelligence officer was dropped after american intelligence officials , who apparently feared retaliation by russia , intervened with federal authorities the officials said tonight that the two cases were not linked the small circle of officials with knowledge of the case began to broaden slightly tonight the arrest and search warrants were under seal , along with affidavits describing the suspected activities of the cia employee while it was not clear what information had been lost in the current case , the ames case indicated what information the soviets prized most highly they pressed mr ames to find out about penetrations of their own spy service by the cia and the nature of american espionage operations inside the soviet union , as well as about military and diplomatic secrets the officials said the arrest carried out this weekend by counterintelligence agents of the federal bureau of investigation had been planned under tight security out of fear that the employee might try to flee the arrest , the officials said , was carried out without incident there was no indication about what might have been the motive for spying , although in recent cases involving americans the main factor was financial gain federal authorities estimated that the russians paid mr ames more than 25 million in exchange for his information investigators are likely to focus on the extent to which the russians tried to conceal the activities of an agent beyond mr ames or continued to use him to obtain information the arrest of mr ames would have almost certainly sent a chill through any other russian spy operations at the cia it is unlikely that mr ames was ever aware of the existence of another operative inside the cia , and he has said he knew of none a fundamental practice in spying operations is to avoid overlapping agents some government analysts had predicted a large number of spy cases might be generated when a wave of defectors from eastern bloc countries came west after the demise of the soviet empire with proposals to sell information about spies for the cia but the number of cases has been small and so far no other career officer of any intelligence agency has ever been accused of spying even after mr ames was identified as a probable spy , a team of fbi agents spent more than two years completing their investigation of him
washington , oct 26 president clinton challenged states today to do more to help victims of gangrelated violence , suggesting they earmark 10 percent of new federal money available for victim services or about 44 million for that purpose it was the latest example of how , as his campaign winds down , mr clinton is doing something no democratic presidential candidate has done in years , if ever he is talking about crime more than his republican rival , and running away with the argument all year , polls have repeatedly shown that the public trusts mr clinton to deal with crime more than his challenger , bob dole , and mr clinton has won the endorsement of the biggest police union organizations in the nation last week alone , mr clinton was broadcasting two emotional television commercials touting his record on crime , and mr dole none accordingly , the president never misses the slimmest pretext to proclaim his stand on crime or be seen as on the case in his weekly radio address today , mr clinton s topic was crime victims and the federal fund distributed to states to help with everything from funeral costs to medical bills it is financed with fines and criminal penalities collected by the government , and because of several recent prosecutions by the administration , it has grown markedly over the last four years recent fines paid by two companies alone 340 million earlier this year by daiwa bank ltd in a fraud case , and the 100 million fine this month on the archer daniels midland company in a pricefixing case have added 440 million to the fund mr clinton said 10 percent of that should be set aside for victims of gang violence as it happens , archer daniels midland is headed by dwayne o andreas , one of mr dole s best friends and contributors a fact that white house aides smilingly acknowledged they knew would be mentioned in articles about mr clinton s proposal today but in his remarks , mr clinton referred only to a major agribusiness corporation with the new resources from these recordsetting fines , mr clinton said , we can help the victims of crimes and prevent gang violence we 're upholding the rule of law we 're putting crime victims where they belong , at the center of the criminal justice system , not on the outside looking in mr clinton recited his history of support for crime victims' rights , beginning when he was as governor of arkansas , and also reminded his listeners that he has endorsed a constitutional amendment giving victims the right to attend and speak at court proceedings , the right to be told when a convict is released and the right to restitution civil libertarians and some lawyers in his own administration strongly opposed that move as an unnecessary tinkering with the constiution , but mr clinton saw it as another building block in his effort to preempt republicans on the issue aides said the president planned to spend most of today quietly , in celebration of hillary rodham clinton s 49th birthday it may be one last moment of calm before he embarks on a final round of whirlwind campaigning in which he will touch base in swing states that cannot be taken for granted , seek to run up the score in states no democrat has carried in years and pitch in to help congressional candidates on sunday , mr clinton is to begin a threeday trip to virginia , tennessee , missouri , minnesota , illinois , ohio and pennsylvania , before returning to the white house tuesday night for the last time before election day then on wednesday , he will head west , to michigan , colorado , arizona , california , nevada and texas , before doubling back to florida by the final weekend , aides said the president is still reviewing his options for the remainder of the time before he heads to little rock , ark , for election day
the spears of twilight life and death in the amazon jungle by philippe descola translated by janet lloyd illustrated 459 pages the new press 25 philippe descola , a french anthropologist who teaches at the school for advanced studies in the social sciences in paris , decided when he was a graduate student in the late 1970 s that he wanted to seize upon the spirit of a free and solitary people as yet untouched by civilization it was a worthy ambition for a young former philosophy student who had had enough of theoretical ethnology and so , urged on by none other than claude levistrauss , the father of structuralism , mr descola set off for the headwaters of the amazon he lived for three years with the achuar tribe of the jivaros indians , learning their language and studying just about every imaginable facet of their lives , from the way they make blowpipes to their interpretations of their dreams mr descola s book , the spears of twilight , is a detailed , probing , exhaustive and sometimes lyrical account of his anthropological sojourn it is clear from the beginning that this is a serious piece of scholarship deeply grounded in theoretical literature but based on extensive fieldwork and keen empirical observation , with no subject or question off limits moreover , mr descola s writing , translated from the french , is evocative and intellectually luxuriant , so much so in fact that it is a bit like the jungle itself , dense and profuse , difficult here and there to make a path through the reader s effort is rewarded , however mr descola depicts a world of fabulous strangeness and explains it fully , with sensitivity and philosophical depth the jivaros , who live in an indianasize territory that straddles the tropical border of peru and ecuador , have in fact been the object of a morbid european fascination for centuries this is because of what mr descola calls their exotic peculiarity headhunting and headshrinking but mr descola quickly assures us that this was not why he chose them for his ethnographic research indeed , the particular tribe that he studied , the achuar , do not hunt heads he was drawn to them because , despite their sinister reputation , they remained ethnologically unknown as he puts it , there was a strange discrepancy between ignorance and notoriety in the outsiders' view of them in any case , they are an interesting people , a living illustration of one of mr descola s basic ideas that primitive people act and think in fundamentally different ways from modern people it is not just that the achuar practice vendettas , engage in polygamy , believe in shamans and recognize no spiritual difference between the human and the natural worlds the more fundamental difference has to do with an achuar world that is saturated with mysterious invisible forces suggested in dreams , myths and hallucinations these forces , as interpreted by the achuar , play an extremely practical role in guiding decisions in everyday life mr descola writes some brilliant , not easy pages trying to climb inside the achuars' mind to describe not only their beliefs but how those beliefs are connected in a closed system that is both utterly foreign to western rationalism yet rigorously logical when , for example , the achuars hear the stories of christian missionaries , they are polite and respectful but immediately interpret matters from their own utilitarian standpoint when a missionary named don jaime told the story of the raising of lazarus from the dead , for example , he succeeded only in upsetting the indians who , more than anything , fear the persistent obstinacy of the dead who try to return amongst the living when the priest urged the achuar to love one s enemies , his teachings were received with horrified incredulity by men and women brought up since childhood in the cult of the vendetta you can see a lot in three years , and mr descola saw just about everything births and deaths , hunting and fishing expeditions , the ways husbands beat wives and wives wreak vengeance on husbands the spears of twilight even has a whodunit about a wife who ran away from her husband and the subsequent murder of the husband mr descola listens to and records the achuars' myths , their dreams , their experiences in war he witnesses them in hallucinogenic states sitting without food or drink for days in the jungle in search of what they call arutam , a kind of renewed energy that comes from a hallucinogeninduced visit from the ghost of an ancestor he interviews shamans and strives to understand tsentsak , the invisible projectiles by which they can bring misfortune on distant others he explains and interprets the practice of headshrinking , even though it was practiced not by the achuar but by other jivaros tribes above all , mr descola engages in a sustained attempt to get into the minds of his subjects , to figure out how they think he describes an achuar world of men and women , of animals and plants and of a constellation of ghosts , demons and spirits that are not just mingled but also interdependent when somebody is sick , for example , the cause lies in the distant actions of a specific individual , and only that person or a person with the proper affinity to him can cure that sickness before the achuar hunt , the master of a household must have a kind of dream called a kuntuknar , in which the dream image has an inverse counterpart in reality thus , to dream that one is shooting at birds up in the branches of a tree augurs well for a fishing expedition , just as a dream about catching fish foretells of success in a bird hunt mr descola allows that he might have gotten some things wrong about the achuar maybe his informants were having fun with him when they told him that in their dreams fish refer to birds but even allowing for the possibility of mistakes , mr descola has conducted a remarkable study , one that illustrates the value of anthropology as practiced by its great figures by expanding our knowledge of the full human gamut , it gives us a sharper sense of the nature of our own spot in the vast arena of human possibility

even as the presidential candidates debate sweeping tax breaks , american businesses have beaten them to the punch companies large and small have been signing up executives and other top employees for a generous tax break not available to other americans hundreds of thousands of people have become eligible , most in the last few years , at more than 24 , 000 businesses the deal is simple rather than take all their pay , and pay taxes on it , executives let the company hold on to some the company invests the money , and the executives do not pay taxes on any of it until they take the money years later it sounds like the ira or 401 \( k \) savings plans used by tens of millions of americans except this deal excludes the rank and file and has special benefits there are no government limits on how much can be put away , and many top executives have put away millions a lot of companies guarantee them high interest rates on the money and throw in a matching contribution just like that , the executive is able to build a much bigger nest egg than people who have to pay taxes immediately , taking greater advantage of the magical compounding power that makes all these plans so attractive take john f welch jr , chief executive at the general electric company by deferring taxes on 1 million last year , he stands to have 263 , 000 more within five years than he otherwise would have had this executive privilege is known as deferred compensation once rarely used , it has soared in popularity in recent years an unintended consequence of government moves to raise tax rates for highincome americans , clamp down on executive pay and limit the benefits that executives can receive from regular company pensions and it is spreading quickly , even as half the private work force has no retirement benefits and many companies have been trimming pension benefits for rankandfile workers indeed , its growth represents a threat to a prime tenet of the nation s retirement policies that companies offer benefits as fairly and to as many workers as possible consider these facts the amount of deferred compensation can be staggering in 199495 alone , the chairman of the mcdonnell douglas corporation , j f mcdonnell , deferred 25 million in pay , and michael h jordan of the westinghouse electric corporation deferred 18 million john l clendenin of the bellsouth corporation has close to 10 million in his deferral accounts there is no ceiling on how much money can be sheltered one executive alone , roberto c goizueta , the chief executive of the cocacola company , has accumulated 9364 million , most of it in company stock that will not be taxed until after he retires no longer are just a chosen few capitalizing on this tax break a growing number of large companies , including merrill lynch , ibm and tenneco , have recently expanded their plans to include hundreds or thousands of prized employees other companies have included middle managers and salespeople making as little as 55 , 000 even nonprofit organizations as diverse as mount sinai hospital in manhattan and the boy scouts of america greater new york councils are signing up owners of small businesses like ollies station restaurant in tulsa , okla , are now setting up deferral plans , allowing them to save for retirement without including their workers , who by law would have to be part of any pension or 401 \( k \) plan in most cases , because the money remains in the business s coffers , the company and its shareholders pay taxes on it instead of the executive , and therefore effectively subsidize the tax breaks the government s rationale for allowing special deferredcompensation plans for executives is that they typically do not cost the treasury but a lot of companies , following the advice of an army of consultants , are reducing their own tax bites by buying life insurance policies on the executives under government rules for insurance , this allows the deferred money to grow for years without being taxed an analysis for the new york times by coopers lybrand , the accounting firm , shows that the government would typically lose half of the taxes it would have collected about 300 of the 1 , 000 largest public companies are now using life insurance to finance their deferred compensation , according to one survey all this is happening with no attention from the government top officials at both the treasury and the labor department said they were not aware that there was much growth in the deferral plans or in the use of life insurance to underwrite them the government has no idea how many billions of dollars are being deferred , or how much this might cost in most cases , it requires companies to write a letter informing the labor department that deferred compensation is being offered many companies never bother to file anything with the labor department and its list is riddled with inaccuracies for example , it does not include exxon , ford and walmart though they all offer deferred compensation
washington , dec 16 gen curtis lemay , head of the nation s airborne nuclear strike force in the 1950 s , was notoriously unforgiving of commanders whose air crews failed nonotice combat inspections general lemay , an intimidating air force figure , would relieve an offending commander even if the officer was otherwise very talented when he was once asked why he was so harsh , general lemay is said to have replied , i do n't have time to distinguish between the unfortunate and the incompetent a commander s responsibility for a unit s failures and triumphs is a military tradition but that strict standard of accountability seemed absent last week in the air force s decision to exonerate the general responsible for safeguarding the housing complex in saudi arabia where 19 american troops were killed in a terrorist truckbombing last june the finding contradicted a major conclusion of a separate pentagon investigation in september that singled out the officer , brig gen terryl j schwalier , for failing to take adequate measures to safeguard the troops' housing some military experts say the armed forces are more reluctant to enforce a strict code of accountability in the postcoldwar era or are applying the code inconsistently one reason , the experts say , is that the military downsizing has intensified the competition for scarce promotions , so even the slightest blemish can end an officer s career we 've come 180 degrees from general lemay , said martin binkin , a military personnel specialist at the brookings institution accountability is a major problem largely because senior officials recognize that any punitive action in an officer s file is a careerkiller in april 1995 , in one example of leniency , lieut comdr john stacy bates was grounded for a month after he lost control of an f14 the plane crashed , but the crew ejected safely that accident would have ended most aviators' careers but commander bates s boss thought him promising enough to give him another chance last january , commander bates crashed another f14 jet , in nashville , probably while showing off to his parents , a navy inquiry found the crash killed commander bates , a fellow officer and three people on the ground in the saudi disaster , the pentagon inquiry concluded that after general schwalier had been warned that the housing would be vulnerable to a bombrigged truck outside the fenced compound , he failed to move the fence away from the building or relocate the troops the man on the scene is the responsible individual , said lieut gen robert b johnston , a retired marine officer who was the commander of american forces in somalia you have to assume the terrorist is skilled and is looking to find your vulnerabilities but the air force says general schwalier should be credited for the security improvements that he made even though they were not sufficient to avert the blast it also argues that security outside the perimeter was the saudis' responsibility and that no prudent commander could have defended against what the air force says was a 20 , 000pound bomb the pentagon inquiry estimated the bomb size at closer to 5 , 000 pounds in schwalier s case , if a mistake was made , maybe it was that he was not diligent enough , said gen mike loh , a former senior air force commander , but it was something you put in the honestmistake category indeed , many top generals and admirals fear that the public is holding the armed forces to an unrealistically high standard some forget that placing our servicemen and women in harm s way around the world involves risk , gen j h binford peay 3d , the commander of united states forces in the persian gulf area , told the senate armed services committee last july while the american people have every right to demand competence , character and leadership from our military commanders , they should not expect zero defects commanding such a rigid standard produces timid leaders , afraid to make tough decisions in crisis , unwilling to take the risk necessary for success in military operations but the military all too often operates on a double standard when assigning culpability for instance , it is rare for a general to face courtmartial when two air force f15 fighters flying over northern iraq mistakenly shot down two united states army helicopters in 1994 , killing all 26 people aboard , only a captain went to trial he was acquitted but when an air force f15 pilot was killed when his plane crashed on takeoff in germany in may 1995 , the air force courtmartialed a pair of mechanics , even though senior air force safety officials had known for years about the problem that had caused the crash and had failed to correct it one of the mechanics , a technical sergeant , committed suicide rather than face what he considered an unjust trial in that case , there was an overreaction in the air force s pursuit of accountability , general loh said many leading democrats and republicans have expressed outrage that none of the 10 officers responsible for safeguarding the troops in saudi arabia got even a mild reprimand , which would be censure enough to doom a career when terrorists blew up the marine barracks in beirut in 1983 , killing 241 servicemen , president ronald reagan took responsibility for the security failure the overall commander of marine forces in beirut , col timothy j geraghty , got a mild reprimand , but it was enough to end a career destined for generalship legislators also asked last week how the air force investigation and the pentagon inquiry , headed by gen wayne a downing , a retired army officer , could reach such different conclusions when they reviewed largely the same evidence lieut gen james r clapper jr , a retired air force intelligence officer who was the secondranking official on the pentagon inquiry , said the conflicting results might reflect cultural differences between air and ground commanders and the way they viewed threats to their troops in dangerous foreign missions this may be a case of where , at least implicitly , differing standards apply to the way a groundforce commander would look at a problem and the way an air commander would look at the problem , said general clapper , who said he had not seen the final air force report a ground commander would be more sensitive to a potential ground threat than an air commander as the air force to prepares to release its findings on the saudi attack , general schwalier is at the pentagon , overseeing air force operations his onestar promotion to major general was approved by the senate last year , before the bombing , and takes effect on jan 1
at home in france tales of an american and her house abroad by ann barry ballantine , 20 ann barry , a journalist who died last month of cancer , was a new yorker who loved france and decided to live there during twoweek vacations sight unseen , she bought a cottage in the country village of carennac , a storybook setting with its 11thcentury church and abbey , tiny bridge and stone houses clustered along the gently flowing dordogne river , she writes in at home in france books about living in idyllic places are tricky , usually demanding that the writer maintain a fine balance between celebrating such good fortune and viewing it ironically to avoid antagonizing the reader , whose life is apt to seem less gracious barry , however , is too happy about her little house and her sojourns there to summon more than a soupon of irony delectable meals are eaten lovely scenery is viewed reticent neighbors become good friends barry does include descriptions of laborious home improvements and curmudgeonly artisans , plus a chapter about a mysterious animal that befouls her floor and another about being bitten by a mean dog , but none of these incidents provoke much consternation carennac , she tells us , is exactly where i wanted to be in this age of gloomy revelations , perhaps the greatest surprise in at home in france is its quiet but persistent good cheer suzanne berne
denver , june 4 resourceful if not inspired , the colorado avalanche s fans have come up with an answer to the florida panther s fans in these stanley cup finals call it a new version of the trap defense aware that they throw plastic rats in miami to celebrate panther goals , the denver customers responded tonight by throwing about a dozen rat traps in response to goals by their team the avalanche erupted for three of them in a span of 3 minutes 51 seconds in the second period the barrage erased a 10 florida lead and gave colorado a 31 victory in game 1 at mcnichols arena denver fans just kind of picked up the hint , said uwe krupp , the big colorado defenseman , who had one goal among his five shots game 2 of the fourofsevengame championship round will be played here on thursday night , and it might be better than the occasionally sluggish show put on by both teams tonight although the panthers took the early lead , they may have been tired after winning the eastern conference finals , which they did n't clinch until saturday night in pittsburgh the avalanche , which was not at the top of its form either , might have been somewhat out of sync from its long rest it had not played since beating detroit last wednesday night to clinch the western finals colorado missed several splendid chances by shooting just wide of john vanbiesbrouck s net and could have won by a far bigger margin instead of hanging on in the final frantic minutes marc crawford , the colorado coach , joked that the problem could have been the altitude in the mile high city turning serious , he said nerves came into it , as well as the layoff we won the game and we did n't play our best , crawford said one player who played close to his best was colorado s patrick roy , who stopped 25 of 26 florida shots , including some dangerous chances in the third period he was sensational , crawford said he s a proven winner roy pointed out that the panthers had won the first game of every round this spring and that the avalanche felt it was important to stop this trend we could not take them lightly , roy said the panthers upset boston , philadelphia and pittsburgh during their run to the final round but they had not met a team as healthy , balanced and talented as the avalanche scott young and mike ricci scored the other colorado goals tom fitzgerald scored for florida his teammate scott mellanby said that it is disappointing to lose the first game and that we all know there are bumps in the road we have to come out thursday night ready to go we have to win so we can split mellanby is responsible for the rat ritual , one of the most interesting things about his hardworking but nondescript group on opening night in october , mellanby killed a rat with his hockey stick in the panther locker room from such stuff do legends grow gene manques , the mcnichols arena worker in charge of disposing of the rat traps , said he threw away about 10 none were set to snap , he said , adding that they looked as if they had come right out of their packages bigger and heavier than the plastic rats of miami , they could do more damage if they accidentally hit a player or fan we do n't have any use for them , said manques , adding that mcnichols has no live rodents of its own arthur pincus , a national hockey league spokesman , said the league frowns on the escalation of the missile race among hockey fans we do n't like any object being thrown , pincus said colorado played without right wing claude lemieux , who was serving his second suspension of the playoffs this twogame idleness was the result of his hit from behind on detroit s kris draper in the last game of the western conference finals , a check that left draper with a broken jaw and other facial injuries earlier in the same round , lemieux served a onegame suspension for hitting detroit s slava kozlov with a punch to the head from behind fitzgerald gave the panthers a 10 lead at 16 51 by flipping a wrist shot over the shoulder of roy from near the slot after a bit of disarray among the colorado defenders in their own zone colorado tied the score , 11 , at even strength at 10 32 of the second period on a long wrist shot by young , who beat vanbiesbrouck through a screen of legs the avalanche went up by 21 at 12 21 on a goal by ricci , who took a rebound off the boards and put it past vanbiesbrouck and they increased the score to 31 at 14 21 on a goal by krupp , who dashed in from the blue line toward the net and took a diagonal pass from valery kamensky tonight , i think we matched their enthusiasm and work ethic and we capitalized on a few chances , krupp said and that was the difference in the game there s nothing scientific about this photo mike ricci falling down

austin , tex the economic news on friday was so good it was a disaster unemployment has fallen to 53 percent , the lowest it has been in six years june payrolls increased by 239 , 000 jobs and the average hourly wage rose by 9 cents , the biggest onemonth jump ever recorded , a level noticeably above the inflation rate , as the new york times reported pandemonium on wall street ! the yield on the 30year treasury bond leaped a quarter of a point , finishing at 718 percent and stocks plummeted the dow jones industrial average dived 114 points amid the commotion , one could hear the bond bears roaring their message that , with inflation sure to surge , the federal reserve must raise shortterm interest rates many of the bears said that had the fed s open market committee known at its meeting last wednesday what the secretive bureau of labor statistics would announce two days later , it would surely have raised them some urged the fed to correct this error immediately without waiting until the next regular meeting in august nonsense there is no cause for alarm the evidence does not portend surging inflation to begin with , the annual rate remains low 29 percent in the year that ended in may inflation is not accelerating instead , productivity growth appears to be picking up if this pattern continues , it will permit wages to grow for some time , with little effect on price inflation the decline in unemployment also means little some economists still hold to the notion of a natural rate of unemployment at 6 percent or a slightly lower figure , below which they believe inflation spirals out of control but joblessness has been less than 6 percent without raising inflation since september 1994 recent economic studies confirm there is little reason to fear that prices will rise simply because of low unemployment or , for that matter , rapid growth most inflation of past decades had different causes , like oil shocks and war some say to forget the facts an official of a regional federal reserve bank recently told business week \( anonymously , of course \) that you have to move on anecdotal data in other words , monetary policy should be based on gossip mercifully , it is likely that the federal reserve board s governors do not share this view the bears in the bond market must also know that their inflation warnings are unfounded so what are they up to \? the answer seems clear we have a speculation problem , not an inflation problem the bears make their living by betting on the fed s next decision , not by calling the economy the bears predict when shortterm rates will be raised and when they will decline by selling and buying longterm bonds in advance , they can make a lot of money if their predictions are right so it is natural that they try to affect the fed s decisions this game has been in full cry since at least october 1993 , when bondmarket insiders correctly anticipated \( and may have provoked \) the fed s rate increase of february 1994 all through that year , each time the fed raised interest rates , the stock and bond markets churned if shortterm rates are pushed up tomorrow , many ordinary investors will panic and dump their bonds and stocks then the speculators can buy cheap and shear the sheep the small investors , in the speculators' lingo sell bonds , create gossip , influence policy what a game ! but maybe the game has changed news reports preceding the fed s inactivity last week suggested that the chairman , alan greenspan , may have given up the preemptive strike antiinflation strategy of 1994 good the idea that the economic evidence counts for something is central to proper monetary policy but mr greenspan s possible credibility as a pragmatist , only a week old and none too sturdy , will depend on facing down the bears it would be an extremely good thing if the federal reserve held the line through the summer and fall at least as long as core inflation \( calculated without volatile food and energy prices \) , measured over six months or so , remains reasonable in that event , the interest rates on longterm bonds will finally begin to decline , and maybe shortterm rates will follow traders committed to a strategy of creating panic will lose money so what \? the fed did the right thing now it should stand firm and show the speculators who is in charge drawing
probably no art so caters to the public s hatred of the establishment as outsider art the work of the uneducated , the insane , the criminal and the underprivileged , outsider art preserves a myth of esthetic purity for a culture tired of its experts the outsider artist has not suffered the deforming influence of art school , and his art requires no esoteric explanation from critics motivated merely by the joy of making art , the outsider is totally unaware , or so the story goes , of the history of art or of the marketplace the lives of outsider artists , moreover , are frogprince parables the biographical labels beside outsider works upstage the pictures , telling stories of broken homes , poverty , physical or mental disability and unrelieved bad luck then , at long last , the sufferer takes up brush or chisel and finds satisfaction that is not to say that outsider art is without masters but these few geniuses cannot account for the public frenzy over art made by the naive , the mad and the marginalized and frenzy it is the fourth annual new york outsider art fair , held on the last weekend in january , was bigger and more successful than ever everything was up , reported sanford l smith , the fair s producer gate , sales , catalogues thirtyfive dealers displayed the work of hundreds of artists , from the famous adolf wolfli and howard finster to the lesser known carlo and michel nedjar \( mr imagination , who wears his work , did n't come this year \) three hundred people attended the opening dinner given by the museum of american folk art , where each guest was invited to become an insider no sooner had the fair closed than the price of madness , a play by catherine filloux , opened off broadway at the intar theater in the play , a sculptor named henri , depressed by his artist s block , discovers the work of his mad aunt aloise , named for one of the psychiatric patientartists beloved of the painter jean dubuffet , who created the category of art brut in the 1950 s aloise draws with crayons and toothpaste when henri arranges a show for her , a reviewer describes her work as a celebration of the cosmogony of a woman , the feminine pulsation aloise s work becomes an instant sensation , and artists all over town copy her , testing toothpaste as an expressive medium aloise s dealer is ecstatic , and henri gets over his block the importance of outsider art has also been proclaimed by congress in november , the american visionary art museum opened in baltimore , designated in a congressional resolution the official national museum , repository , and educational center for american visionary and outsider art congress defined it as art produced by selftaught individuals who are driven by their own internal impulses to create and hailed it as a rare and valuable national treasure the museum s opening exhibition , the tree of life , contained works in wood , from the stunning reliefs of the africanamerican daniel pressley to a huge model of the cutty sark executed in toothpicks artist after artist depicted the garden of eden as if pointing to the imperiled innocence of the outsider artist on the top floor of the museum , visitors could dine in the joy america cafe , directed by the chef peter zimmer , who , the museum explains , is also selftaught , possessing an intuitive genius appropriate for an institution that champions raw inventive artistry one of his visionary dishes is chinese dim sum with charred pineapple and coconut aioli the art fair , the play and the museum are all parts of what gerard c wertkin , director of the museum of american folk art in manhattan , calls the second wave of interest in outsider art the first wave occurred in the 1920 s , fanned by high artists like charles sheeler , marsden hartley and elie nadelman , who sought in unknown artists an essentially american creativity the current wave , which started in the 80 s , is concerned not with americanness but with authenticity in an art scene overrun with political and ideological work , people hunger for art without artifice , an unmediated expression of the inner self , mr wertkin says this esthetic purity is the false promise of outsider art the contradictions in the outsider myth are so blatant that it takes a willed blindness to go on believing after all , outsider art is bought , displayed and criticized , and whatever purity it has is controlled not by the artist but by those who sell and exhibit the work john e ollman , director of the janet fleisher gallery in philadelphia , one of the premiere showcases for selftaught artists , describes the lengths to which he goes to prevent contamination he will not supply his artists with materials , supervise their financial or personal lives , or even meet them jack lindsey , curator of american decorative art at the philadelphia museum of art , insists that he will neither buy nor accept gifts of outsider works unless he can satisfy himself that the artist s dealer is not interfering with the work in any way , that the artist s background is free of academic influence and that his or her parents' background is likewise unsullied these criteria , mr lindsey contends , would disqualify more than half the works in the recent outsider art fair
washington it is 10 o'clock in the morning , and douglas mcgrath is still waking up any time before noon is a shock for me , he says genially as he contemplates the breakfast menu in the sunny dining room of the four seasons hotel in georgetown then again , i 've been in a state of shock for a year this particular morning , mr mcgrath could be forgiven for being in shock he has just made his directorial debut with emma , one of the most ballyhooed movies of the year , for which he also wrote the screenplay last night , he flew in from his home in manhattan to previewed it at the white house , and sat next to the president of the united states the closest he had come to bill clinton before that was as creator of the flapjack file , the new republic magazine s desultory running parody of the first family s doings from a secret service agent s view the flapjack file is a devastating sendup of president clinton as a waffling fatfood fanatic married to someone known as mrs rodham flap and attended by a key aide referred to only as mr steph this parody followed one on the bush administration , called the shrub file , which began when mr mcgrath submitted an account of president george bush s sudden sushirefunding , as he puts it , at a state dinner in japan but mr mcgrath is neither too tired nor too shocked to be funny this morning his eye alights on a lowfat selection billed as birchermuseli , a concoction of grains , nuts and lemon juice , and his lips pickle and his high forehead furrows in a frown sounds like john birchermueseli to me , he mutters when the waiter arrives , mr mcgrath has something altogether different in mind you do n't , he purrs , happen to have a croissant that s collided with a piece of chocolate , do you \? when a pot of english breakfast tea arrives with an extra pot of hot water , he pulls another face and fingers the lids do you suppose one of these has poison in it and the other does n't \? mr mcgrath offers up a constant stream of epigrams , aphorisms , witticisms and adverbial asides like funnily enough , all delivered with perfect diction in the drollest of deadpans he long ago learned that he could make money being funny and he has the resume to prove it his first job out of princeton in 1980 was as a writer for saturday night live , and after more than a decade kicking around in the business , he hit the bigtime in 1994 writing the oscarnominated screenplay for bullets over broadway with woody allen he is also nothing if not selfconfident he proposed to direct emma with practically no directing experience since his college days , and his next project is to be a oneman political satire offbroadway still , that is a long way from jane austen s effervescent comedy of 19th century manners what s a nice little satirist like him doing in a hollywood maelstrom like this \? in fact , he says , he had loved the novel for years , and always dreamed of making the movie so while bullets over broadway was being filmed , he simply drafted a screenplay i thought when it opens , there 'll be a window , but a little one and it 'll be open for about one second when people think , 'hey , who s this guy working with woody , and what else does he have and what else does he want to do \? ' mr mcgrath recalled and i thought i should have something that would be harder to sell in a normal time , when i have n't just collaborated with a big genius and this was before , of course , i knew that jane austen was going to turn out to be the john grisham of the romantic novel set i thought jane austen would be a good collaborator , he continues , because she writes , you know , superb dialogue , she creates memorable characters , she has an extremely clever skill for plotting and she s dead , which means , you know , there s none of that tiresome arguing over who gets the bigger bun at coffee time mr mcgrath took his screenplay to the folks at miramax , which had released bullets over broadway they bit , and even agreed to let him direct next thing he knew , mr mcgrath was in england for a rigorous 41day shooting schedule , shepherding a sterling british cast led by one celebrated american ringer , gwyneth paltrow if i had n't been told , i would never have known that he was a firsttime director , said toni collette , the australian star of muriel s wedding who plays harriet smith , the object of emma s wellintended but disastrous romantic scheming his passion to adapt the novel brought about a certain empathy he knew what he wanted , he was so calm , so specific i ca n't say enough good about him the closest mr mcgrath came to austen growing up was the town in texas , where his father , a transplanted connecticut yankee , was an oil producer in midland but he says he feels comfortably familiar with the novelist s tight little slice of genteel british life in which emma woodhouse , matchmaker and meddler , comes to learn just how much she has to learn

to the editor in his carping review of marjorie garber s book dog love \( nov 17 \) , andrew sullivan is so busy revealing his own boorish and condescending attitude toward those whose love of the dog is blind and passionate that he overlooks one of the reasons the dog has been so honored , celebrated , mythologized and deified in the world s literature and art for thousands of years while difficult humans are quite capable of pretense , folly and pettiness , to say nothing of calculated treachery and cruelty , the dog , even in its muteness and comparative dumbness , happily has none of these stanley taikeff edison , nj
urbana , ill , dec 14 fragments of music from a student band drift through the sousa archives at the university of illinois , the final repository of thousands of pages of the music that john philip sousa and his band played over 40 years on tour by christmas , the students will be gone , and silence will reign in the rooms that hold sousa s baton , a pair of his white kid gloves , a bandsman s jacket with 36 yards of fine braid , his large wood podium and the lid of the steamer trunk on which the conductor , who was 5 feet 7 inches tall , stood to conduct christmas day will nonetheless be a milestone , the 100th anniversary of the stars and stripes forever , sousa s most beloved march , 3 minutes 45 seconds long when played at march tempo the music is a national treasure that congress made the national march on dec 11 , 1987 god and the american flag inspired it , the composer liked to say leonard bernstein once said he would have given 10 years of his creative life to have written it the first time that it was performed , for president william mckinley at the philadelphia academy of music on may 17 , 1897 , the audience insisted on hearing it three times , causing sousa , as the baltimore sun noted , to blush with pardonable pride to the very roots of his rapidly disappearing hair the original score , which ends with the flourish christmas '96 and is kept at the library of congress , was written for piano over the years , sousa also arranged it for mandolin , guitar , zither , mixed chorus and male quartet sousa s main biographer , paul e bierley , interviewed more than 50 members of the sousa band , and none could recall a concert in which the stars and stripes forever was not played mr bierley asked the musicians whether they ever grew tired of playing it , and he said he always received the same reaction 'is there something wrong with you , young man \? ' the inspiration for the march , according to sousa s autobiography , marching along , arose on a trip to europe and the steamship voyage home to new york aboard the teutonic , a white star liner his manager had died , and sousa was feeling anxious and homesick suddenly , sousa wrote , i began to sense the rhythmic beat of a band playing within my brain it kept on ceaselessly , playing , playing , playing throughout the whole tense voyage , that imaginary band continued to unfold the same themes , echoing and reechoing the most distinct melody i did not transfer a note of that music to paper while i was on the steamer , but when we reached shore , i set down the measures that my brainband had been playing for me , and not a note of it has ever been changed sousa often composed entire compositions in his mind , said phyllis danner , curator of the archives here , although the composer , who was trained in the violin , would occasionally take out an imaginary violin and finger the parts some of the most famous parts of the stars and stripes forever , the florid brass and piccolo , did not appear until sousa completed the score for the band four months later this year has seen a number of anniversary performances , including unlikely places like mir , the russian space station when you hear i'm tired of conducting 'the stars and stripes forever , ' you 'll know i 've died , sousa once said , and it was the last piece that he ever conducted , in a rehearsal in reading , pa part of the march is engraved on his tombstone
st petersburg , russia the last two months have been like christmas in much of russia eager to buy his way back into the good graces of voters before the election on june 16 , president boris n yeltsin has been tossing cash in the direction of nearly every worker , factory director and farm collective he can find there is , however , at least one major , federally supported enterprise that has not been a beneficiary of mr yeltsin s new largess the state hermitage museum here , this country s preeminent cultural institution and one of the world s greatest museums , has not received a ruble from the government for more than six months we are at a very dangerous moment , said vladimir y matveyev , the hermitage deputy director in charge of finance and planning this is an enormous operation , and we are getting no money to finance it we are paying our staff its salaries but that is all we can pay contractors nothing we have stopped renovation , we are watching as buildings begin to crumble a museum needs attention , and attention costs money desperation is not new to russian museums since the soviet union fell apart and most museums were forced to find their own funds , times have been tough but the hermitage , founded in 1764 by catherine the great as a court museum , has always been a bit of an exception it has shaken off trouble like the most stolid of russians three times in its history , the enormous collection has had to be evacuated to avoid possible destruction from advancing armies it has survived and prospered under coups , revolutions and sieges just last year , the hermitage was able to mount one of its most controversial but admired shows in decades an exhibition of 74 stunning paintings , nearly all impressionist or postimpressionist , that had been seized from nazi germany at the end of world war ii and hidden in the museum s vaults by order of a series of soviet governments hidden treasures revealed included works by degas , van gogh , renoir , matisse and many others but exhibitions like that cost lots of money , and until recently the government has always provided support for the hermitage more than 85 percent of its funds come from federal sources , and although it faced a deep financial crisis a few years ago , the museum raised more than 100 million in the last three years , and for a while that seemed like enough but that was assuming that federal leaders would ante up their share in 1993 , the russian government gave the hermitage 38 percent of the money that was budgeted for the museum then the money practically stopped last year , mr matveyev said , the museum sought 200 billion rubles \( about 40 million \) from the government to safeguard and enhance its collection of three million works of art it was promised slightly less than half that , but received only about 12 million \( last year s budget for the metropolitan museum of art , by comparison , was about 100 million , and officials there , too , complain of severe financial restrictions \) this year , the hermitage has so far received none of the money allotted to it by the culture ministry in moscow , and officials there have told the hermitage directors that the most they can hope for is 20 percent of the total , or less than 5 million a spokesman at the culture ministry said that all such payments were delayed this year , and that officials were aware of the hardships faced at the hermitage , but that museums across the country were having similar difficulties everyone always says they are aware of our problems , mr matveyev said that hardly makes them go away most of the people who work at the hermitage and there are several thousand are contract employees they are responsible for maintenance , cleaning and providing security for what is usually considered one of the world s three greatest museums \( along with the louvre and the met \) we ca n't pay them a thing now , said mr matveyev , who has tried to raise money by selling catalogues , videos , tshirts , posters and the other items commonly found in western museums what policeman is going to work free \? many of the scholars and curators at the hermitage earn less than 100 a month mr matveyev , the no 2 official , said he was paid about 1 million rubles a month , which is 200 until recently , most factories and other major state businesses in russia were also about six months behind in paying salaries to workers these wage arrears have become one of the biggest and most frequently voiced complaints against mr yeltsin in the current campaign in his speeches , the communist leader running for president , gennadi a zyuganov , makes a point of blaming mr yeltsin for allowing russia s cultural institutions to wither under capitalism , although it was the soviets who first let the hermitage go badly in need of repair the president has responded , with help from the washingtonbased international monetary fund , by flooding treasuries of longneglected industries with cash infusions from one end of the nation to the other but neglect is becoming apparent here , in part , many critics say , because there are not many votes to be found by mr yeltsin in this museum most people in russia already view him as the least unpalatable alternative mr yeltsin really needs the votes in the factories and on the farms that leaves the hermitage with little hope for help soon one newly renovated display hall , the spanish skylight room , which houses masterworks by goya , velazquez and others , was opened two months ago it is lighted beautifully particularly at this time of year by a glass roof set into the ornate ceiling but other rooms , dozens of them scheduled for similar renovations , remain gray , drab and often closed the deep stone walls need constant attention , because they are on the banks of the neva river , and too much humidity could threaten the priceless old master and impressionist paintings last month , hermitage officials abruptly halted construction on a major new storage , renovation and repair center on the edge of the city the building was to store more than 1 , 500 pieces of rare furniture , most of the enormous canvasses that are not on display and the bulk of the museum s huge trove of archeological materials i do n't want to sound alarmist , mr matveyev said we are still open for business , and business is still good but neglect is a habit we ca n't afford photo the hermitage museum in st petersburg , russia , which reliesheavily on government funds , has not received any for six months \( associated press \)
on the waterfront of beacon , ny , the city s environmental director , shabazz jackson , pointed to a brushchoked peninsula jutting into the glittering hudson river a year ago , the oneacre site overflowed with rusting cars soon it will be restored and turned into parkland we 're taking it back , mr jackson said in the lobby of the old mcgrawhill building on west 42d street , volunteers with a group called floating the apple were building the sixth in a growing fleet of 25foot wooden boats until the 1930 s , anyone in manhattan could stroll to a boathouse and go for a row in similar boats , said michael davis , an archeologist turned boatbuilder now plans were afoot for the first new public boathouse , on pier 84 near the intrepid seaairspace museum it s one thing to see the water , he said it s another to be out on it in the antiquefilled parlor of a hilltop mansion overlooking the hudson at kingston , ny , donald casey served coffee to neighbors mr casey , a manhattan emigre , had bought the house as a crumbling wreck four years ago and as part of kingston s riverfront revival turned it into a luxurious bed and breakfast we saved this place from literally getting torn down , he said up and down the hudson , people who had for decades turned their backs on the sullied river are now rummaging through old wharfs , sagging buildings and fading memories to find new ways to link their lives and livelihoods to the water riverfront cities and towns are realizing they can build a new economy around tourism and recreation many planners say the hudson valley with its fjordlike highlands , grand mansions , historic sites , and hills blanketed with orchards and vineyards could someday rival the rhine or loire valleys of europe as a tourist destination tourism already directly employs 90 , 000 people in the region , a figure that has risen 38 percent in 20 years by contrast , thousands of factory and high technology jobs along the river have disappeared in the last 30 years because of cutbacks at ibm and other companies the hudson highlands , the mountains north of peekskill which a century ago were being blasted into building blocks and 30 years ago were envisioned as a hollowedout hydroelectric plant are now largely protected and a popular destination in just one of many new initiatives , a ferry service began running on june 3 from the metronorth train station in peekskill past the eagle aeries of bear mountain up to the granite bastions of west point other excursion ferries are also planned , harking back decades to when day line steamboats took city residents upriver on summer escapes with wildlife and many fish species abundant , so too are hikers , bird watchers , and anglers this spring , so many striped bass have been caught that state environmental officials are considering introducing a fishing license for the lower hudson the income would pay for research on the fish swimmers , too , are drawn to the river , and after the fourth of july for the first time in nearly a decade they will be able to bathe at westchester county s only public hudson river beach , in croton point park when i was growing up , we lived in tarrytown , hastings , croton , said barbara muldoon , a resident of north tarrytown , ny , who has swum in the river in bad times and good now they 're all crotononhudson , hastingsonhudson some of us appreciated the river no matter what now all of a sudden everyone loves it but impediments to a strengthened bond between people and the hudson still abound from manhattan to albany , 60 percent of the river s banks , mainly on the eastern shore , are cut off by railroad tracks since 1917 , some 42 percent of track crossings on that shore have been closed by state transportation officials , including many pedestrian overpasses that once allowed fishermen and picnickers casual access to the river many of the overpasses had deteriorated for lack of maintenance as communities turned away from the river lingering traces of pcb s in striped bass and some other fish have imperiled one of the hudson s most heralded features its commercial fishermen a few dozen people still make a living at it , but for some of them , the only steady work now is setting nets for biologists trying to understand declines in sturgeon and shad and development pressure dormant after the market crash of october 1987 and the loss of thousands of ibm jobs is once more on the rise , partly because the newly attractive river itself has drawn residents to the area new york state cities like newburgh , poughkeepsie and kingston have seen new battles over longforgotten tracts at that renovated mansion in kingston , mr casey and his neighbors had gathered not just for coffee , but also to plot a legal challenge to a plan by the mayor , t r gallo , to level the top of a neighboring wooded knoll the city s last large patch of open land to build a 56acre industrial park the mayor said the industrial park was needed to keep a local manufacturer , huck international , from moving huck s executives liked the plan , saying the picturesque hilltop would bolster huck s image a few weeks later , the neighbors' lawsuits faltered and the city with more than 18 million in federal aid began bulldozing trees and dynamiting the limestone ridge the tension natural wonder or economic power \? for nearly two centuries , the relationship of people to the hudson has been tugged between the poles seen in the struggle in kingston development and preservation
albany , sept 28 concerned that cutbacks in federal welfare benefits will place significant new strains on the state budget , gov george e pataki plans to renew his push for strict time limits on home relief , the statefinanced cash assistance program for the poor though similar calls in the past from mr pataki have died in the democraticcontrolled assembly , the governor said in an interview on friday that the new federal welfare law had created a very different climate , in which democrats will find it harder to reject the idea one reason is purely financial the new law is expected to end federal benefits for thousands of recipients , and its initial impact will be mostly on immigrants and state officials predict that many of those people will turn to home relief for assistance as caseloads increase , so too will the program s costs , which are borne equally by the state and local governments the home relief program last year cost those governments more than 1 billion , paying benefits to 338 , 000 people it assists poor people who do not qualify for federal benefits , usually because they are childless mr pataki said he expected to propose a bill similar to one he introduced in the legislature last winter , which would have limited home relief benefits to 90 days over a 12month period and to a total of five years in a recipient s lifetime democrats in the assembly opposed that bill as too harsh but in an indication that they were willing to compromise on the issue , the democrats offered their own limit on benefits mr pataki argued that democrats would be hard pressed to fight time limits on state benefits now that president clinton has endorsed a fiveyear lifetime limit on federal benefits moreover , if the state does not restrict home relief , he said , people will flock to new york to enroll in its program after they lose their benefits elsewhere this just compounds the urgency of the situation , mr pataki said i'm very concerned that with the changes that are happening around the country , if we remain one of the only states with unlimited home relief , we will become a magnet the governor s proposal comes at a time when many advocates for the poor are calling on the state to maintain , even expand , home relief as a safety net for people who lose federal benefits the advocates also contend that placing time limits on home relief would violate a provision of the state constitution that says the aid , care and support of the needy are public concerns and shall be provided by the state if the republicans were actually to say , 'we really do need a safety net , ' then that is the home relief program , said anne erickson , legislative coordinator for the greater upstate law project , an advocacy group for welfare recipients and if you look at the overlay of the constitution , you 'll see you cannot time limit a basic safetynet program mr pataki s comments marked the beginning of what is almost certain to be an extraordinarily contentious battle in the legislature over how to implement the new federal law , which gives states far greater freedom to run their programs the lawmakers will have to rewrite reams of state social service law and grapple with hundreds of questions created by the most significant change to welfare policy in 60 years for instance , the legislature must devise a plan for putting tens of thousands of welfare recipients into work programs , under threat of huge penalties by the federal government if it fails there is bipartisan agreement that the state will need to provide daycare services for parents with young children and job training for the unskilled to meet that goal but just how much the state will spend on such programs will be the subject of much legislative debate the federal law also gives the state scores of new options in administering its programs , and many of those are sure to be hotly contested the state can choose , for example , to deny benefits to people convicted of drug felonies or to people who have additional children while on welfare it can end assistance to teenage mothers who refuse to earn high school diplomas or to mothers who do n't help officials establish paternity it can seek exemptions from work requirements for childless adults on food stamps and end benefits for legal immigrants already living in the country \( pataki aides have said the governor would almost certainly oppose that one \) but none of those issues will be thornier than the question of what to do with home relief home relief , which began in the great depression , has evolved into the largest state program of its kind , providing relatively high benefits without time limits to more recipients than in any other state , including california in recent years , however , home relief caseloads have fallen sharply under home relief s eligibility rules , people who are poor enough to qualify for federal welfare can generally also qualify for state benefits , state officials said that means that many of the people who are pushed off the federal rolls could eventually collect home relief if they wanted
blacksburg , va , feb 17 if there was going to be a snowfilled pothole along the road to an undefeated regular season for the university of massachusetts , this was going to be the time and place virginia tech had been waiting for this afternoon since it decided to move to the atlantic 10 this season from the metro conference the storm had forced the umass itinerary to plan b , a detour to greensboro , nc , late thursday that disrupted the minutemen s plans a hostile crowd , a 10thranked opponent , a stressful trip none of those factors made any difference with marcus camby playing a dominant role at both ends of the floor and his teammates adjusting to their imperfections , the topranked minutemen defeated the okies , 7458 , to win their 25th consecutive game this season virginia tech , 193 over all and 102 in the atlantic 10 , had won its previous 17 games at noisy cassell coliseum the 10 , 052 fans in the steep stands create the same wall of noise that once was regularly heard at the palestra in philadelphia but by the end they were quiet , except for a smattering of applause when camby left the game in the final seconds umass , 130 in league play , remained the only undefeated team among major colleges and moved within four games of becoming the first division i team to complete an undefeated regular season since nevadalas vegas in 1991 our goal at the beginning of the season was not to go undefeated , camby said , but to go undefeated in the months of march and april camby scored 31 points , 15 of which came during a remarkable yet puzzling 10 1 2minute stretch at the start of the game when the 6foot11inch junior faced single coverage i did n't get singleteamed since the kentucky game , camby said , smiling he scored 32 points in that game when camby is smiling , that is not good news for an opponent if they tried to doubleteam me , i do n't think it would have made a difference , camby said i was surprised , said donta bright , who scored 19 points , 13 in the first half , for umass he s the best player in the country he can do things guards do playing him oneonone , i do n't think anyone can do that camby took control of 10 rebounds , all at the defensive end , several of which came during a stretch in the second half when the hokies attempted to produce a run he was credited with just two assists , but his ability to find open teammates often presented opportunities for the minutemen he blocked five shots and created the impression in the minds of the hokies that he was in position to alter many more it was just a mental thing , said bill foster , the virginia tech coach , whose team made 36 percent of its shots , including 29 percent in the second half he s not going to block every one of their shots , unless you think he will his imposing presence became the biggest of virginia tech s problems i do n't know if i 've played against an individual that does all the things marcus camby does , said foster , who coached in the atlantic coast conference , at clemson , for nine seasons foster would list the names michael jordan , james worthy and sam perkins of north carolina , buck williams of maryland and danny ferry of duke he said that camby , at this point , is the equal of all of them i said all week , he s a point guard in a 611 body , foster said while camby s mobility , versatility and deceptive strength provided the beginning of the umass accomplishments literally he was not alone dana dingle , the toooften overlooked senior forward from the bronx , led a defensive effort that held ace custis to 7 points , half his average custis , a 53 percent shooter , made 3 of 13 shots if he gets those 13 shots , foster said , he 'd make 9 of them tomorrow he did not make them today , with some of the minutemen showing signs of vulnerability carmelo travieso was held to 9 points and 2 of 6 shots the only other consistent source of offense for the minutemen was bright , who made 7 of 10 shots when virginia tech kept the game beneath a 10point margin , and tried to come closer with less than seven minutes to go , camby took control his turnaround 12foot jumper restored a 10point lead , 5141 when the hokies came back within 8 , camby made a 10footer along the left baseline a jumper by bright in the lane , and the foul shot to follow , soon had the umass lead up to 12 a 4point play a 3point jumper by troy manns and a foul on edgar padilla , reduced the lead to 8 and gave the crowd some hope with 4 minutes 33 seconds to play but padilla made a 3point shot and camby deflected a pass at the other end then came the type of move that makes camby so difficult to defend , whether the attempted answer is one player , two or three he drove smoothly with a point guard s crossover dribble for a score and a 6148 lead this is an average game for me , camby said i can play a whole lot better average \? this was a notion that temporarily left the coach of the minutemen speechless i hope he s right , coach john calipari said photo marcus camby grabbing a rebound yesterday at virginia tech hehad 31 points and 10 rebounds \( associated press \)
fulfilling his pledge to spend 1 million on advertising for the new york primary , steve forbes yesterday completed the purchase of enough television time to make him almost unavoidable to viewers over the next few days in addition to buying a virtual barrage of 30second spots , mr forbes bought a halfhour of time to stage a callin show on wnyw , channel 5 , that will be broadcast at 7 pm on wednesday preempting the simpsons in contrast to mr forbes , senator bob dole has bought a relatively modest amount of advertising time in new york none of his ads will appear in heavily democratic areas like manhattan , and he is using cable television to concentrate his efforts on more republican regions , like long island and westchester pat buchanan , who will be on the ballot in 23 congressional districts in new york , appears to have bought no television time in the state mr forbes s advertising purchase , spread over broadcast stations and cable systems throughout the state , is one of the heaviest in the history of the state s presidential primary still , it is light when compared with some of new york s most expensive political advertising battles , like the 1994 gubernatorial race in the final week of that general election campaign , some experts estimate , gov george e pataki and former gov mario m cuomo each spent more than 2 million on advertising until recently , mr forbes s television offensives had been one of the driving forces behind the republican primary campaign but in the last week or so , the flood of forbes advertising dollars has slowed significantly , to the point that many campaign insiders began to speculate that he would not make a serious showing in new york even now that mr forbes has demonstrated he does plan to spend a significant amount of money in new york , it is unclear how much good it will do him in the next 24 hours , as voters in eight states go to the polls , news coverage of the campaign is likely to be so intense that it will drown out all but the most forceful advertising message now we 're into the stage when the free media counts for much more than their paid media , said hank morris , a democratic political consultant based in manhattan advertising in new york is always a tricky venture for political candidates to reach voters in new york city , the state s largest broadcast market , candidates end up paying to reach millions of viewers in other states , mainly new jersey and connecticut the waste is particularly acute in primary campaigns , when only a small fraction of eligible voters will go to the polls and it is worse for republicans , who have never had a serious primary battle before , because most of the city s residents are democrats undaunted by these problems , the forbes campaign has bought several hundred thousand dollars of broadcast time on new york city stations on wnbc , for example , the forbes campaign has purchased 90 , 000 worth of advertising spots the schedule , according to the wnbc s records , shows that the campaign has set out a conventional political advertising strategy , concentrating its purchases around news shows , when the proportion of politically motivated voters is the highest two forbes spots are scheduled to run this morning during the nbc news program today at a cost of 1 , 200 another will run right before the noon news at a cost of 550 , and yet another will run before the 5 pm newscast at a cost of 1 , 500 the campaign has also bought a 30second spot during tonight s broadcast of the nbc news magazine dateline at a cost of 11 , 000 the commercial mr forbes is broadcasting in new york focuses on his proposal for a flat tax to replace the graduated income tax bob dole and steve forbes disagree on the flat tax , the narrator says while the ad is relatively new , it has run in other states before its use here running short of money , mr dole s campaign is apparently trying to minimize wasteful spending by avoiding new york city broadcast stations and advertising in the city only on cable mr dole is advertising on broadcast stations upstate people familiar with mr dole s advertising buy said that he had purchased no time in manhattan on the time warner cable systems in brooklyn and queens , the dole campaign bought 17 , 000 worth of advertising spots for the week leading up to thursday s primary , according to a time warner executive who spoke on the condition of anonymity , consisting of 65 on cnn , 60 on espn , 30 on tnt , 30 on usa and 12 on headline news mr forbes has purchased many more advertising spots on time warner cable systems in the city 180 on ny1 and 120 on cnn at a cost of 36 , 000 dole campaign officials would not say how much they were spending on television time in new york but it was clear that they were being outspent on both cable and broadcast stations in almost every region of the state at wkbw , the abc affiliate in buffalo , for example , mr forbes has spent about 37 , 000 to mr dole s 16 , 000 , according to tim noble , the station s national sales manager and at whec , the nbc affiliate in rochester , mr forbes had bought 19 , 000 worth of ads by yesterday afternoon , the station s sales manager , harvey lazear , said , while mr dole had bought none mr dole is running the same television spots in new york that he has been running in states like colorado and georgia , which go to the polls today the spots , one 60 seconds and one 30 seconds , both discuss mr dole s agenda and end with the same tag line tested in war , proven in peace

who said it would be easy \? one woman s life in the political arena by elizabeth holtzman with cynthia l cooper illustrated 276 pp new york arcade publishing 2495 the political career of elizabeth holtzman started on a remarkable high elected to congress at the age of 31 , she was one of the most memorable figures of the house judiciary committee s watergate hearings in 1974 tiny , feisty , bespectacled and clearly unafraid of the titled middleaged men a lot of women now holding office first got the idea they could be in politics from watching ms holtzman pester gerald ford about the nixon pardon but her career seems to have ended on a remarkable low twice defeated for the united states senate and loathed by many members of her own party , she was turned out of her job as new york city comptroller two years ago , in a city where reelection bids by incumbent democrats are usually safer than school crossing zones what i could n't understand was the way i was vilified in the comptroller s race i was often called a 'witch' by politicians and journalists how had i deserved this ire \? i had stood up for my principles , trying to make the world a better place , she says plaintively in her autobiography the story of how this smart , hardworking liberal fell from political grace is worth understanding did her woes , as she sometimes suggests , arise from the fact she was a woman \? was it the national turn to the right \? the wellknown frostiness of her public persona \? ms holtzman says her only crime was refusing to traffic in the homey anecdotes and campaign gossip that most politicians dispense to reporters as a matter of course whenever political discussions strayed into chatter about personalities or the private lives of public officials myself or others i felt we were being distracted from the serious considerations at hand and , as if by instinct , moved back to the issues , she writes who said it would be easy \? will appeal only to people who are already curious about what went wrong with liz holtzman s career , and even they are going to have to struggle to find an answer between the lines the book reads like a 276page resume , listing endless accomplishments , enemies bested , battles won the only lessons learned are wildly selfevident generalizations like bravery , i saw , had many faces , or i had learned one simple tenet there is rarely justification for saying nothing can be done cynthia l cooper , a lawyer and journalist , must have had a struggle writing a firstperson book with a first person who refuses to give up anything of her inner life the senate races ms holtzman lost in 1980 and 1992 \( inadvertently making the career of alfonse d'amato in the process \) are squeezed into a single chapter , along with her disastrous final run for comptroller despite ms holtzman s obvious rage and confusion , her explanation of what happened suffers from the same flaw that makes the rest of the book so hard to read there s no juice to the story no recounting of what anybody said , what her opponents and coworkers were like , how it actually feels to be in a campaign that s helplessly selfdestructing for example , the 1980 senate race had an astonishing cast of characters al d'amato , john lindsay , bess myerson and jacob javits , the incumbent republican who was hiding an incurable disease , yearning for one chance to run the senate foreign relations committee after years in minorityparty exile but none of them appear in person ms holtzman gives the entire campaign six pages , most of them devoted to blaming the press , the democratic party organization , ed koch , mario cuomo , labor unions and jimmy carter for her defeat ms holtzman claims she still would have won by a landslide if javits had n't insisted on staying in the race as a thirdparty candidate but she never explains why she did n't pick up the phone and ask beg the ailing , wounded javits to drop out alas , ms holtzman winds up painting a picture of herself as a woman who is oblivious of anything outside her career , but feels that s ok because her career is trying to make the world a better place
got a problem with that new personal computer \? the manufacturer s 800 number is always busy \? finally , after hours , maybe days , you get through but the helpdesk people are n't helpful \? the exercise in frustration is shared , at one time or another , by many of the 30 million american households that have the mixed blessing of owning a pc the usual response slam down the phone and curse the company that made the infernal machine but yesterday , a group of disgruntled pc users went further they sued a computer maker , contending that the technical support was so bad it amounted to fraud and breach of warranty contracts the main defendant in the classaction suit , filed in state supreme court in manhattan , is leading edge products inc , a pc maker in westborough , mass the plaintiffs , who seek to represent all leading edge customers , are three pc users richard a brummel of queens , martin j leahy of manhattan and carol byron of tacoma , wash computer help desks are often the target of consumer complaints but according to industry analysts and lawyers , this case appears to be the first in which a pc maker has been sued for poor helpdesk service i 've heard of gripes of all types , but never lawsuits before , said kurt johnson , an analyst who specializes in pc support services for the international data corporation , a research firm if this suit goes anywhere , it could open up a can of worms for the industry the plaintiffs' troubles with their leading edge computers , purchased from 1993 to early 1995 , seem to be vexing versions of common problems a modem kept crashing the pc in one case , for example , while in another the computer refused to play cdrom software according to a lawyer for the plaintiffs , they spent days trying to get through to the technicalsupport desk at leading edge , only to get busy signals and recorded messages when they did speak to leading edge personnel , the lawyer said , the company representatives routinely passed problems off as being the fault of software and hardware suppliers instead of being the responsibility of leading edge all of the plaintiffs' computers were covered by oneyear or extended warranties from leading edge this is really a warranty claim , said dan drachler , a lawyer at the new york firm of zwerling , schachter , zwerling koppell , which is representing the plaintiffs many computer buyers are given a warranty and it turns out to be meaningless companies in the pc industry should not sell a product and just leave people dangling calls to leading edge yesterday seeking comment on the lawsuit were not returned mr drachler said leading edge had been singled out because it seemed to be the object of a ground swell of complaints however , a survey of computer users published in the december issue of pc world , a trade magazine , rated leading edge s reliability and service as fair well below leaders like apple and compaq but on a par with gateway 2000 and acer leading edge sold 185 , 000 pc s in the united states in 1994 , and 90 , 000 in the first half of last year , but almost none in the second half of 1995 , according to dataquest , a research firm a dataquest analyst , kimball brown , spent yesterday trying to get help on his own leading edge pc , with no success they do n't seem to have been shipping for six months , mr brown said , and this could be part of the explanation last october , daewoo telecom ltd of south korea , the corporate parent of leading edge , announced that it had sold leading edge to a swiss electronics company , manuhold investment ag
san diego , aug 12 this is a convention run by revisionists , determined to obscure if not rewrite recent history , to the electoral advantage of the republican party bob dole and his managers want to erase memories of the shrill animosity that marked their party s convention four years ago in houston they want to soften the confrontational record of the republicancontrolled 104th congress , especially that of the house of representatives they want to consign this year s republican platform to the dustbin of history quickly indeed , they wanted to do so even before it was passed the platform may be more conservative than it was in 1992 , the delegates may be more unyieldingly conservative than they were in 1992 , but the television face of this convention will be more moderate , if the managers have their way the real audience , the one that will decide who lives at 1600 pennsylvania avenue after next jan 20 , is not in the conventional hall but out there in videoland , and it is far more moderate than the delegates for the men and women who face the uphill task of defeating president clinton , if not for the more outspoken conservatives among the delegates here , the first order of business is to make san diego the nonhouston they are not shy about admitting it for example , nelson warfield , mr dole s press secretary , volunteered this during an interview today there s a story to be written here , and the story is , this is not houston houston , after all , was followed by the defeat of george bush , who entered his hometown convention a favorite for reelection , yet lost mr dole and his circle have thought a lot about that and concluded , one of them said recently , that we may not have murdered our candidate right there , but we tied lead weights around his ankles and sent him out to take his licking the people who ran things four years ago are out , and people who made republican images in happier days are back people like michael j deaver , the michelangelo of the balloon drop , and the joint impresarios here , william i greener 3d and paul j manafort , who both made their names in the 1980 s , heyday of ronald reagan mr reagan , ill with alzheimer s disease , was of course not here , but billy graham , jack kemp and others appeared in a loving film about the reagan era , when the republicans seemed on the way to lasting majorityparty status then nancy reagan came on , cheered to the rafters she brought many to tears as she spoke of the long goodbye his illness represented charles black , once mr manafort s partner in the consulting business , observed this morning that no fewer than 128 people spoke at houston , where some of the speakers were actually permitted to say what they thought four of those 128 people said things that were considered too controversial , too rightwing , and all of the coverage that came out of that convention concerned those four , mr black told a group of reporters over breakfast i do n't consider that your fault i consider it our fault , and we 're trying to do better so there will be no patrick j buchanan this time , no marilyn quayle they were two of the speakers with a snarl last time and those who have been invited to speak have been told how long to talk , what subjects to address and how to treat them craig fuller , the permissive 1992 manager who approved mr buchanan s text , is a forlorn , forgotten man in 1996 a thoroughly prodole senator , accustomed to having his way , grumbled over the weekend about brainwashing after his indoctrination session gen colin l powell is popular enough , and the managers wanted him badly enough , that he could \( and did \) negotiate the terms of his appearance tonight , which produced the kind of boffo television politicians dream about few others could the result is that some officeholders with demonstrated appeal to the kinds of urban and suburban voters who hold the key to a dole comeback , like govs pete wilson of california , william f weld of massachusetts and george e pataki of new york , will not be making substantive speeches here mayor rudolph w giuliani of new york and mayor richard j riordan of los angeles , who were hailed as party heroes when they won three years ago , are not bothering to come to san diego the big danger , of course , is that in making sure nobody disrupts the message of reassurance from san diego , everything will seem so relentlessly scripted that it resembles a meeting of a party plenum in the old soviet union those did n't make for very lively television better dull , say the republicans , than divisive and those who do speak will keep to their allotted 3 , 5 or 10 minutes or else haley barbour , the party chairman , gave them the word again on nbc s today this morning , just a few hours before the first gavel fell i 'll be darned , he said , if on my watch , colin powell or bob dole or somebody is going to speak after prime time , like happened in houston as is his wont , mr buchanan has a rather different slant on all of this he wants to rewrite not the notion that houston was typical of the republican party in its intolerance , but the notion that he did anything wrong there at his rally last night in nearby escondido , a kind of rump convention , he showed a video that included not only his 1992 speech with its famous proclamation of cultural war but also shots of television anchormen saying he had done his party a service
it has been six years since karen schmidt took what she calls a trip through fordham s judicial hell , but the memories still torment her she was a junior at fordham university in the bronx that january in 1990 , a confident young woman who had founded the jesuit school s first dance team and she was talking and drinking beer with two male students in her dormitory room past 3 am suddenly , she said , one of the men , a football player twice her size whom she considered a friend , pinned her and proposed a sexual threesome she went from disbelief to desperation , telling him to stop , struggling and crying hysterically when he penetrated her as the other man prepared to join in the dormitory s resident assistant first took the matter to the dean of students , after another female student said that the football player had raped her , too the dean , henry toutaine , brought disciplinary charges against the two men but under pressure from the athlete s friends , ms schmidt said , the other woman withdrew her complaint it would be ms schmidt s word alone against the men s word that the sex had been consensual in fordham s inhouse judicial system , the dean himself was the investigator , judge , and jury the dean heard from different students but he had no subpoena power and none of the investigative tools of law enforcement meanwhile , ms schmidt said , she became an outcast and a target of harassment by the accused and their friends with obscenities shouted in public places , food thrown at her in the cafeteria and banging at her dormitory door in the night on the morning of april 3 , 1990 , she said , the dean telephoned her to say he had decided that he could not prove anything either way and that the charges against the men would be dropped she said he had also told her that the men were threatening to sue if disciplinary action was taken she left school the same day i was faced with this betrayal by a huge institution which is supposed to stand for what is right , ms schmidt said the people involved are no longer at fordham mariellen gallagher , a university spokeswoman , said that now , an administrator would stand by the student i ca n't say whether the outcome would be any different today , she said but ms schmidt might have felt more support mr toutaine , who directs judicial programs at gustavus adolphus college in st peter , minn , said he could not recall specifics and was constrained by confidentiality i personally believe that campus judicial systems attempt to do the right thing , he said do i think my judgment is perfect \? no ms schmidt filed a police report that summer , she said , but an officer advised her to put the incident behind her now a radio disk jockey near washington , she went through years of depression until confronting the events at fordham in therapy she said she wanted her name used in this story to show how far she had come

london born in scotland of an italian father , tom conti recalls his glasgow childhood in the 1940 s as happy and secure , with none of the difficulties often associated with immigrant families he was lucky , mr conti , 54 , admits his father owned a beauty parlor , and the business did well there was money , and there was comfort , he said my father was a kind of middleclass italian scot mine was a silverspoon immigrant life so mr conti rather hopes that it was not his italian surname that won him a lead role in someone else s america , goran paskaljevic s film about foreigners struggling to make it in brooklyn the film , which opens in new york on friday , won a prize at last year s cannes film festival according to the film s promotional material , mr conti s background helped him understand the courage of immigrants , but he makes no such claim acting is just pretending , he said recently in london where he is appearing in neil simon s chapter two still , while he was learning about the problems of today s immigrants during the filming of someone else s america , one memory did come back to him there was a club in glasgow where all the italians would meet to play cards and gossip , he recalled when my father was asked why he did n't go there , he always replied , 'if you want to be italian , live in italy' that tends to be my approach if you want to be iranian , stay in iran otherwise , get on with it and shut up ! but , as mr paskaljevic demonstrates in his new film , it is not always easy to cut emotional ties to the old country alonso , a warmhearted spanish bar owner played by mr conti , has made the break bayo , an illegal immigrant from the former yugoslavia , played by miki manojlovic , a veteran serbian actor , needs more time their elderly mothers , who traveled to new york more as mothers than as immigrants , dream of returning home weaving its way between old and new worlds , the film s plot focuses on bayo , who has left his three children in his mother s care in a mountain village in montenegro he has a miserable job clearing toxic waste from an industrial site but earns enough to send money home alonso rents him a room in exchange for cleaning the bar the two men are also buddies , and together they even concoct a way to convince alonso s blind mother \( played by maria casares \) that she has returned to her native village but bayo s letters and money are not reaching his family alarmed by the silence , his mother \( played by mr manojlovic s own mother , zorka \) travels with his three children to the united states via mexico as they wade across the rio grande , bayo s youngest son is swept away alonso becomes the family s protector the film follows the characters' pursuit of the american dream bayo s son , luka , marries a chinese girl , alonso chases a young syrian woman , and bayo struggles to learn english mr conti said the set of someone else s america itself resembled an immigrant neighborhood , with the mood of dislocation intensified by the fact that the brooklyn scenes were shot in studios in hamburg one day we had people speaking german , greek , serbocroatian , french , spanish , english and chinese , he said it was the tower of babel mr paskaljevic , 49 , whose recent films include time of miracles and tango argentino , said his own peripatetic life helped him identify with bayo he left his hometown , belgrade , in 1971 for athens he later studied film in prague he now lives in brussels , and soon he will move to paris during research for someone else s america , he and gordan mihic , the screenwriter with whom he has now made five films , spent weeks in immigrant communities of new york and new jersey , even meeting a woman who had lost a baby while crossing the rio grande into the united states but most of all , mr paskaljevic said , he considered his new film his response to the completely stupid war that has torn apart my country , the former yugoslavia nationalism is the worst thing that can happen to human beings , he said in a telephone interview from los angeles , where he was discussing a new movie project the film was a kind of escape for me , the director said , because we worked with so many nationalities we had almost 20 nationalities in front and behind the camera in the crew , i had a muslim and a croatian and this gave me great pleasure even tom conti is from an immigrant family yet mr conti recalled that while everpresent , the bosnian war was rarely discussed on the set , perhaps because , along with mr paskaljevic , mr manojlovic , his actress mother and sergej trifunovic , who plays luka , are all serbs we tpied to stay off the subject because there was no way of dealing with it , mr conti said there was nothing to say you could n't have a discussion about it because all the minds were closed the actor was first spotted by mr paskaljevic in the movie shirley valentine , nonetheless enjoyed making the film bayo and alonso are both losers , really , he said , but they show such spirit and affection it s a tragicomedy the subject is deadly serious , but it s terribly funny

shanghai , march 19 like many taiwan businessmen who live and work in this city , chiang yumin likes to relax by leaving his steel factory at the outskirts of town to meet friends for a meal at taipei city or one of the other hip , upscale restaurants that cater to tai shang , as taiwan businessmen are known in mainland china but it is hard for mr chiang to relax when all his friends are talking about what they see as the possibility of war we 're nervous every day , so we 're used to it , he said , smiling wearily none of us really expect war to break out , but it s on our minds all the time with taiwan and china closer to military conflict than they have been in decades , investors from taiwan are on edge here , torn by two seemingly conflicting actions china s efforts to encourage investment at the same time that it conducts military exercises near taiwan just before the presidential election is held on saturday more than 100 , 000 business executives from taiwan are believed to be in china they have brought a surge of investment , some 25 billion , second only to money from hong kong and more than from the united states , demonstrating china s economic stake in avoiding a serious showdown over taiwan most taiwan businessmen here prefer to focus on the positive , saying that they cannot imagine that any blood will be spilled and that business opportunities are still good it would be unwise to express political opinion , they say but talk of war has highlighted their uncertain status in the mainland , where they are neither foreigners nor natives in recent years , china s government has welcomed executives from taiwan not just for their investments , but also for the web of personal and financial ties that chinese leaders suggest will help keep taiwan , which they consider a renegade province , from becoming too independent in blaming its current troubles with taiwan on president lee tenghui , china favors increased contact with ordinary taiwan residents although relations are getting tense and complicated , we want to promote more trade and investment from taiwan , said zhang zhichun , director of the taiwan affairs office in shanghai new investors may hesitate , but the ones already here can see what a good environment it is though that environment has been good in recent years , it is now under threat from the current dispute most businessmen seem to doubt that armed conflict will occur , but some express fear that they could lose their stake in the mainland all that has been achieved over the last 5 to 10 years could disappear , said kent liu , chairman and general manager of shanghai taylor food company , which makes ice cream if there were a war , the taiwan economy would collapse , and so would the economy in the coastal areas of china not long ago , anyone from taiwan visiting china was suspected of being a spy for the nationalist government , which fled to the island in 1949 after losing a civil war to the communists executives from taiwan began entering the china market 10 years ago and , by emphasizing common language and ignoring political history , became savvy and aggressive investors by the end of 1995 , they had committed an estimated 25 billion in all kinds of enterprises in china but today , with politics threatening to undercut china s prosperity , the taiwan businessmen occupy a somewhat precarious position they are insiders , but they do not quite belong the government has assured us they will protect our rights , said yang tacheng , chairman of shanghai s taiwanese businessmen s association i believe them our interests are deeply intertwined yet mr yang described how , despite having the same language and cultural upbringing as mainlanders , he felt like a complete outsider when he arrived here in 1992 , and how it took three years before he got used to living here he was welcomed by the government as a compatriot , but has to pay a higher foreigner price in hotels and on airplanes he was free to head his own company , but cannot speak freely with his staff for fear of political misunderstandings like many of his colleagues from taiwan here , mr yang left his wife and children in taipei , taiwan s capital , and travels to taiwan to see them for a few days each month he is in china to make money chinese officials estimate that there are more than 30 , 000 companies in china with taiwan investors , and though no one counts exactly how many taiwanese live here , mr yang suggested that it could be more than 100 , 000 as an indication of the role that taiwan businesses play in china s economic boom , mr yang estimates that they employ five million people , and perhaps can account indirectly for the employment of another five million that means about 30 million people are living off taiwan companies , he said , counting children and other unemployed dependents mr liu predicts a peaceful resolution to the crisis and says he is so eager for news about it that he reaches for the taiwan newspapers delivered to his home as soon as he returns from work , irritating his wife with the way he ignores her she does n't like it , he said , but i feel like i have to know what is happening we ca n't influence politics all we can do is sit off to the side and talk about it

kandahar , afghanistan when neighbors came to mullah mohammed omar in the spring of 1994 , they had a story that was shocking even by the grim standards of afghanistan s 18yearold civil war two teenage girls from the mullah s village of singesar had been abducted by one of the gangs of mujahedeen , or holy warriors , who controlled much of the afghan countryside the girls' heads had been shaved , they had been taken to a checkpoint outside the village and they had been repeatedly raped at the time , mullah omar was an obscure figure , a former guerrilla commander against occupying soviet forces who had returned home in disgust at the terror mujahedeen groups were inflicting on afghanistan he was living as a student , or talib , in a mudwalled religious school that centered on rote learning of the koran but the girls' plight moved him to act gathering 30 former guerrilla fighters , who mustered between them 16 kalashnikov rifles , he led an attack on the checkpoint , freed the girls and tied the checkpoint commander by a noose to the barrel of an old soviet tank as those around him shouted god is great ! mullah omar ordered the tank barrel raised and left the dead man hanging as a grisly warning the singesar episode is now part of afghan folklore barely 30 months after taking up his rifle , mullah omar is the supreme ruler of most of afghanistan the mullah , a heavyset 38year old who lost his right eye in the war against the russians , is known to his followers as prince of all believers he leads an islamic religious movement , the taliban , that has conquered 20 of afghanistan s 32 provinces mullah omar s call to arms in singesar is only part of the story of the rise of the taliban that emerged from weeks of traveling across afghanistan and from scores of interviews with afghans , diplomats and others who followed the movement from its earliest days in 1994 it is a story that is still unfolding , with the taliban struggling to consolidate their hold on kabul , the capital the city fell three months ago to a taliban force of a few thousand fighters , who entered the city with barely a shot fired but the taliban , despite their protestations of independence , did not score their successes alone pakistani leaders saw domestic political gains in supporting the movement , which draws most of support from the ethnic pashtun who predominate along the pakistanafghanistan border perhaps more important , pakistan s leaders , in funneling supplies of ammunition , fuel and food to the taliban , hoped to advance an old pakistani dream of linking their country , through afghanistan , to an economic and political alliance with the muslim states of central asia at crucial moments during the two years of the taliban s rise to power , the united states stood aside it did little to discourage support for the afghan mullahs both from pakistan and from another american ally , saudi arabia , which found its own reasons for supporting the taliban in their conservative brand of islam american officials emphatically deny the assertion , widely believed among the taliban s opponents in afghanistan , that the united states offered the movement covert support american diplomats' frequent visits to kandahar , headquarters of the taliban s governing body , the officials insist , were mainly exploratory in fact , american policy on the taliban has seesawed back and forth the taliban have found favor with some american officials , who see in their implacable hostility toward iran an important counterweight in the region but other officials remain uncomfortable about the taliban s policies on women , which they say have created the most backwardlooking and intolerant society anywhere in islam and they say that the taliban , despite promises to the contrary , have done nothing to root out the narcotics traffickers and terrorists who have found a haven in afghanistan under the mujahedeen in its most recent policy statement on afghanistan , the state department called on other nations to engage with the taliban in hopes of moderating their policies but the statement came as the taliban were tightening still further their islamic social code , particularly the taboos that have banned women from working , closed girls' schools , and required all women beyond puberty to cloak themselves head to toe in garments called burqas that are the traditional garb of afghan village women the result , so far , is that not a single one of the member countries of the united nations has recognized the taliban government and none have come forward with offers of the reconstruction aid the taliban say will be needed to rebuild this shattered country in the words of mullah mohammed hassan , one of mullah omar s partners in the taliban s ruling council , we are the pariahs of the world on the rise catching the tide of discontent how the taliban succeeded in pacifying much of a country that had spent years spiraling into chaos is not , as their progress from singesar to kabul attests , primarily a question of military prowess much more , it was a matter of a group of islamic nationalists catching a high tide of discontent that built up when the mujahedeen turned from fighting russians to plundering , and just as often killing , their own people by 1994 , after five years of mujahedeen terror , the taliban was a movement whose time had come
nothing about the evening seemed particularly perfect more than twothirds of the seats at yankee stadium were empty and there was a threat of rain one starter had won once in his last four starts and the other had won once in 12 starts no apparent reasons to ponder perfection but for almost seven innings last night , minnesota s brad radke was unblemished as he retired 20 straight yankees in a dramatic duel with kenny rogers the operative word in this equation was almost , because radke s run ended in a flourish that favored the yankees in a span of five pitches , the yankees shattered radke s flirtation with perfection , his shutout and his prospects for victory paul o'neill s twoout laser hugged the leftfield line for a double that gave new york its first hit and first base runner tino martinez followed by slashing an 02 changeup into the barren rightfield seats for a homer that catapulted the yankees to a 20 victory over the stunned twins the thing about it was he was pitching a nohitter , but it was still 00 , martinez said we knew that if we could get one run , we could still win because kenny was pitching so great we got pumped after that the yankees should have been pumped the runs came three innings after rogers saved himself and kept the yankees floating by wriggling through a basesloaded , noout situation by striking out ron coomer and roberto kelly on 02 fastballs and inducing matt walbeck to ground out to third rogers exhaled and , later , so did the yankees after edging the twins in 2 hours 4 minutes , the fastest game in the american league this season that hurt them a lot , said rogers , who gave up six hits , struck out five and walked one they should have scored in that situation ninetynine times out of 100 , they score there that one inning was fantastic , manager joe torre said there it was if anything turned the tide , it was right there radke overshadowed rogers for most of the game and retired 24 of the 27 yankees he faced , but o'neill s third hit in his last 25 atbats and martinez s 100th career homer allowed new york to win martinez s 12th homer of the season terminated a team drought of 240 straight atbats without a long ball and delighted the turnout of 17 , 593 fans it was a flat changeup i put right on the tee for him , said radke , who lost a nifty threehitter in which he whiffed three and walked none because he did not wilt with twins on base , rogers steered through eight scoreless innings , before john wetteland relieved him after a leadoff walk in the ninth in winning for the second time in his last five starts , rogers employed his fastball on the inside corner to limit the twins to one hit in six atbats with runners in scoring position and two hits in nine atbats with runners on base we keep talking about the pitchers we do n't have , torre said the pitchers we do have are a lot better than a lot of people rogers , who pitched the last perfect game in the major leagues , for the texas rangers on july 28 , 1994 , against the california angels , admired radke s ability to keep his pitches low and throw consistent strikes still , radke has only one triumph in his last 13 starts i kind of enjoyed watching him , rogers said of radke i kind of thought in the seventh inning , if he gets a perfect game i 'll be disappointed but it would have been awesome for him while he watched radke pursue the possibility of the first perfect game at the stadium since don larsen s during the 1956 world series and the first nohitter against new york since hoyt wilhelm of the orioles in 1958 , rogers implemented his own simple strategy if you keep putting zeros on the board , you put pressure on him , rogers said it might have been a different ball game if he had a couple of runs he might have pitched a perfect game or at least a nohitter after rogers jumped ahead of marty cordova on a 12 count , then walked him to open the ninth , wetteland was summoned wetteland had permitted homers in three of his last five appearances , so the tension increased when dave hollins jolted a fastball to the rightfield warning track for the first out but the pinchhitter chip hale lined out to left and the pinchhitter scott stahoviak grounded out to first to secure rogers s victory rogers still wished he had secured the last three outs i had enough to finish the game , rogers said i wanted to finish it i'm mad at myself for not finishing the game rogers was mad \? imagine how radke felt inside pitch while paul o'neill had the first hit for the yankees , he was distraught enough about being in an 18for89 funk that he asked a reporter before the game do you have any advice \?

if you 're going to be a boss , it s a good idea to make sure the owners have no power over what you get paid that , anyway , is one of the implications of one of the more interesting studies to come out of academia on corporate pay it s long been known from formal studies as well as from anecdotal evidence that chief executives tend to get paid a lot when the directors setting the pay do n't have much of an ownership stake in the company but the new research goes further , studying the top 12 layers of management at hundreds of american companies for many large companies , of course , there are no effective owners the shares are wildly dispersed , and in practice the top management chooses the directors , who are supposed to represent the shareholders but may not do too good a job of it this new study , by steve werner of the university of houston and henry l tosi of the university of florida , appears to be the first to document that even in the lower rungs of management , it pays to work for a company without effective control by owners their study , based on data from hundreds of large companies in the 1980 s , appears in the current issue of the academy of management journal down at the sixth level of management , a long way from the top , the pay difference was 154 percent , about half the 295 percent premium that went to the chief executives the differences tend to get smaller the lower down the ladder you go over all , even after adjusting for everything in sight , including performance , executives get 96 percent more if the owners are not around moreover , bonuses seem to be used differently in the companies with control by management , more people get bonuses , and they seem to get paid regardless of whether the company does well when the owners are on the scene , bonuses tend to reflect actual corporate performance when they are not , bonuses may serve as a discretionary mechanism for providing higher levels of pay to managers , the authors conclude the chief executives treat themselves well , but they also cut in their underlings none of this will come as a big surprise to many people in corporate life to take one example on wall street , bear stearns , with alan c greenberg on the scene , has always seemed to operate a little leaner than some of its competitors , with mr greenberg acting as if people are spending his money there is , of course , a third group of companies , with a large shareholder who is not directly involved in running the company in that case , the study found , managers make only a little more than managers at companies where the large shareholder is running the company as a small shareholder , mr werner said in an interview , it just is n't worth your while to do anything about it it is worth it for a major shareholder perhaps that tends to keep managers more cautious , fearing that the large holder may act so what are small shareholders to do if they can never hope to intimidate senior management \? one choice is to just avoid companies without an owner in sight , and perhaps this effect helps to explain the fact that small companies tend to outperform large ones over long periods of time \( smaller companies are much more likely to have the founder , or at least a later generation of the founding family , watching closely \) another tactic is to consider investing in companies where there is an active shareholder stirring the pot , someone like michael price , the mutual fund manager who encouraged the chase manhattan bank to sell out and who last week disclosed an 88 percent stake in the dial corporation , a company with a reputation for treating its top executives quite well do companies without effective owners on the scene treat all employees better , or just managers \? the data , mr werner said , indicate that the lower levels get paid less than at comparable companies that is , perhaps , one of the things that leaves more money for the managers
fair lawn a good title is hard to find , and important papers , though reminiscent of the captured documents that loomed so large in the vietnam era , is one of the best for the last few years , such papers have come in peace to the walker kornbluth gallery here , bearing not words but images , painted , drawn and printed this time around , there are nearly 70 of them representing 15 artists , most of them wellknown in new jersey and rockland county , ny , and a few with international reputations still , in medleys like this , it is not always the eminent who produce memorable works an example is the series of images , the size of commemorative stamps , by kathryn walker , relatively new to the scene all involve the same photograph of a horse , but each is modified by colors and textures obtained by other means and centered on a sheet of white paper they come across as footnotes to cave paintings , particularly one in which the horse is silhouetted in black on a pinkishcream ground unfamiliar , if only to me , are kjeld tidemand and joyce zavorskas , the first with drawings in chalk and charcoal , the second with monotypes that from afar seem more painted than printed during a period spent on the yorkshire coast , winslow homer focused on the fishermen wresting a living from the north sea mr tidemand finds a similar mise en scene in the north atlantic but for him the sea takes precedence over the ships , mostly freighters , that sail it , and the figures on board are scarcely more than blobs the artist is no great draftsman , but his vague , streaky images left at least one viewer chilled to the bone and recalling the old saw about atheists at sea there are none the largest of ms zavorskas s monotypes is a goldentoned still life on a table , but the best is a small scene of a man eeling in blue water heading the list of notables is karl schrag , who died last year at 83 the exhibition is billed as a special remembrance for the artist , who immigrated from germany in the early 1940 s , having studied in paris upon arriving in the united states , schrag signed on at stanley william heyter s atelier 17 in new york city , only to become its director when heyter returned to paris in 1950 in the present lineup , schrag is represented by a blackandwhite lithograph , a color etching and a monotype , all landscapes as a nearabstraction with calligraphic notations , the etching is of special interest but none of the prints attest to the artist s vitality more eloquently than the blackandwhite of trees hugh mesibov tackles a similar subject in charcoal the rocklandbased artist also contributes effortlesslooking monotypes of trees reflected in water easily recognized as works by stephen greene , another rockland artist with a manhattan reputation , are three abstractions , one painted on paper and two on mylar chief among the artist s distinguishing characteristics are surrealist space and a predilection for cerulean and other cold hues , relieved by orange and crimson but on this occasion , the space is somewhat crowded with bony shapes , and the color , concentrated along the edges of these , is less conspicuous than usual c ats and maidens with decorative tresses have long been staples in the repertory of will barnet but the two large seriographlithographs in this display are bereft of cats , and the women lurking among the trees in spring morning all wear their hair in buns otherwise , they are the welldrawn , delicately colored images that have made mr barnet one of the most popular artists in the world representing emily mason are expressionistic abstractions in rich colors , the most striking of which is an allgreen image accented by a touch of red the works are described as monoprints , but the process is not specified the same goes for jacqueline chesley s variations on a theme of an italian villa with a red roof richard segalman s figures stand alone and in clusters , on beaches and streets that are mostly left white they look like watercolors inspired by photographs and influenced by david levine , but they are billed as monotypes whatever the process , these sparkling little compositions are among the best in the show it remains only to say that the rare photographer who can resist the idea of selfportrait as shadow idea is not lisa solon , who also focuses on a vermont barn , a red house with a broken white shutter , and other picturesque items the show also includes work by barry lee darling , barbara gordon , pamela moore , paul slapion and antoni tapies important papers walker kornbluth gallery , 721 fair lawn avenue , fair lawn works on paper by 15 artists through next sunday hours tuesday through saturday , 10 am to 5 30 pm sundays , 1 pm to 5 pm photo eeling at low tide , a 1994 monotype by joyce zavorskas , partof important papers at the walker kornbluth gallery
if you want to learn how some top executives shoulder responsibility at moments of truth , you can do worse than to examine recent news stories of new york origin and national import the picture , many would agree , is not a pretty one first , there is the continuing ordeal of trans world airlines flight 800 whatever is ultimately found to have blown up the plane , it is hard to see how twa will soon shake off the black eye it received for its performance in the first days of the crisis as everyone knows , many relatives of victims \( and outspoken politicians like new york city s mayor \) felt that airline executives were far too slow to notify families and answer questions even if the twa chief executive , jeffrey h erickson , had no useful answers , specialists in crisis management say , he did little to project the image of a caring corporate leader by walking away from a news conference without fielding a single question they really were n't particularly visible , and you have to be in a situation like this , one expert told the wall street journal , referring to the airline s brass in other words , image is substance in some situations , especially with people in agony consider how japanese executives are expected to behave when something goes terribly wrong , even if they are blameless after 520 people were killed when a japan air lines boeing 747 crashed in 1985 , the company s president , yasumoto takagi , traveled the country apologizing to the victims' families , one at a time then he resigned it mattered little that jal turned out not to have been at fault , for the problem lay with flawed repairs by boeing the symbolism of caring is extremely important , particularly in a major accident where an issue of responsibility is involved , said kent calder , holder of the japan chair at the center for strategic and international studies in washington even if , rationally , it is n't your fault , there s a sense that you bear ultimate responsibility that is not to say that all japanese at high levels are ready to fall on their swords , or that american executives never are but the pattern is clear accepting moral responsibility is a commonplace in japan , while american corporate leaders seem to have a way of not even muttering a simple sorry in bad times , out of fear of it being interpreted as an admission of culpability in future lawsuits human responses often take a back seat to legal concerns the issue of how to bear responsibility has surfaced in another hot story mercifully , this one is not a lifeanddeath matter but it is a question of principle it involves the unmasking of joe klein , newsweek s political commentator , as the anonymous who wrote primary colors much has been made of what newsweek should do with mr klein for having repeatedly denied his authorship less attention has been given to what to do with the magazine s editor , maynard parker he knew all along that mr klein had written the book , but he joined in the lie , to the point of allowing a periscope item that listed likely anonymous candidates , none of them joe klein in short , he knowingly permitted a falsehood to be printed , and in journalism that is about as close as you get to a mortal sin mr parker has now apologized and acknowledged his mistake , one that he says he will learn from there is a question , though , of whether that is enough after all , a young reporter named janet cooke was dismissed by the washington post in 1981 after she was found to have invented a pulitzer prizewnning story about an 8yearold heroin addict and in the 1960 s , this columnist , then working as a campus correspondent for the new york times , slipped a bogus citation into the paper s long list of commencement honors at city college the deception led to an immediate and justifiable dismissal , followed by rehiring 10 years later the sins in these two cases could not have been more different in magnitude but the principle was the same if you knowingly print falsehoods , you risk the ultimate penalty not at newsweek , it seems some people want a public flogging or a public execution , richard m smith , newsweek s editor in chief and president , said yesterday i understand that but i feel obligated to weigh the mistakes against long and distinguished journalism careers there are journalists , including some at newsweek , who are asking if the price for such mistakes are to be borne only by the young and callow and not by veterans , who , however distinguished , should know better it s a safe bet what mr takagi would say
to the editor with some 700 ethnic studies programs at united states universities , i have to wonder why robin shulman \( letter , april 19 \) chose to attend columbia college , which has none the idea that a university should bend its curriculum to student demands is outrageous if columbia wants to require six semesters of western civilization at the \( understandable \) exclusion of other subject matter , that is the prerogative of that institution should the juilliard school create an architecture program because flutists lock themselves in and demand one \? michael mikesell new york , april 19 , 1996

tokyo , april 18 north korea said today that it was considering president clinton s proposal for fourparty peace talks , lending hope that it may be possible to begin a dialogue to reduce the threat of war on the korean peninsula the north korean statement was the first official reaction to mr clinton s plan , made jointly with president kim young sam of south korea on monday during a visit to seoul although the statement said only that north korea is investigating to see whether the proposal is sincere and feasible , its tone suggested that pyongyang may be leaning toward accepting the idea there were none of the usual fulminations against american warmaniacs and south korean puppets in another sign of serious interest , north korean representatives in japan today were reportedly discussing the peace proposal with acquaintances , trying to get a feel for the american motives and how the talks might take shape american officials hope that north korea will accept the proposal and that the discussions will eventually lead to a peace agreement to end the korean war fighting ended in 1953 with an armistice , but no peace treaty , and the barbed wire and mine fields that separate north and south korea mark the largest standoff of opposing troops in the world the latest proposal , similar to ones made unsuccessfully by the united states in 1988 and again in 1991 , was for fourparty peace talks , involving north and south korea , the united states and china it was deliberately vague , so that each side can join the talks and claim a moral victory south korea previously had demanded peace talks just between itself and pyongyang , while north korea has wanted talks only with the united states american officials backed the proposal in part because they are concerned that north korea might launch a desperation attack against the south now that the korean peninsula is in a situation strikingly similar to the state of war , it is urgently required that the outdated armistice agreement should be replaced by a peace agreement , the north korean statement declared the statement , much of which was attributed to an unidentified foreign ministry official and was carried by the korean central news agency , noted that north korea has long urged that the armistice be replaced by a peace treaty between north korea and the united states
seattle , nov 3 an outbreak of e coli bacterial poisoning thought to be caused by a health food fruit juice sold in seven western states has prompted some federal and state health officials to call for a review of whether pasteurization should be required for all widely distributed juices as merchants pulled juices made by odwalla inc from their shelves last week , health officials and food scientists across the west pondered how to prevent such outbreaks some health officials suggested stricter inspection requirements others said juice should undergo the same scrutiny as milk , which since 1987 has been required by the federal government to be pasteurized when transported between states we 're considering all alternatives to protect the public s health and pasteurization is one of them , said fred shank , director of food safety and applied at with the federal food and drug administration until now , federal regulators had not investigated pasteurizing juices because there had been no evidence of widespread contamination , said susan hutchcroft , a spokeswoman for the agency in seattle about 65 cases of illness linked to e coli , none fatal , have been reported in washington and other western states and british columbia health experts have viewed the outbreak as relatively small but the virulent strain , e coli 0157 h7 , is the same one that in 1993 caused three children to die and more than 600 others to fall ill in the pacific northwest from eating infected hamburgers at jack in the box restaurants in the current oubreak , state health officials said they focused on odwalla , which is based in half moon bay , calif , after reviewing the victims' dietary histories and using genetic fingerprinting of the bacteria they traced the outbreak to a batch of unpasteurized apple juice that the company used in many of its fresh mixed fruit beverages in all , health officials in washington state traced 10 of 17 e coli cases to odwalla drinks containing apple juice in colorado , 13 e coli cases were traceable to odwalla products , while california attributed four cases to the juices all of the victims drank the odwalla juices between oct 11 and 21 , health officials said other cases are being investigated in british columbia and texas nevada and new mexico , the only other states where odwalla juice is distributed , have had no confirmed cases the outbreak prompted quality food centers , a supermarket chain in washington , to stop selling unpasteurized juices in its 65 stores the hardest hit victims were children , who suffered symptoms like diarrhea and intestinal distress at least three have been hospitalized with hemolytic uremic syndrome , an illness that can lead to kidney and heart failure children , the elderly and those with weakened immune systems are particularly vulnerable e coli can appear in any unpasteurized or undercooked foods under the right conditions , health officials said it generally originates in the intestines of cows , sheep and birds and can spread to people when fruit comes into contact with manure but the pathogens are eliminated by cleaning and pasteurization , in which heat is used to kill microorganisms pasteurization is the best way to insure that bacteria is killed , said dr john kobayashi , a senior epidemiologist with the washington state health department paul cieslak , a communicable disease expert with the oregon health division said we pasteurize milk , but juice is a new issue that merits investigation we do n't want to hyperregulate everything , but we do n't know whether the e coli risk in juice is 1 in 1 , 000 or 1 in 1 million officials at odwalla say it has sophisticated sanitary and processing codes to deal with contaminants the fruit is hand culled and cleaned with phosphoric acid before being processed for juice , said sydney fisher , an odwalla spokesman the company is looking into the origin of the apples and its procedures , she said unpasteurized juices have become popular as part of the health food boom and with rising demand for fresher foods but such juices pose their own risks , said barbara rasco , an expert in food science and technology at the university of washington i would n't let my 4yearold daughter drink unpasteurized juice , she said in 1991 , 23 people became ill with the the e coli bacteria after they drank fresh cider purchased at a roadside stand near fall river , mass the patients , ages 2 to 70 , experienced abdominal craps , vomiting and severe diarrhea no deaths were reported odwalla , which began operations in santa cruz , calif , in 1980 , now distributes its juices in several western states the drinks are blends of pulpy fruits fortified with vitamins , minerals and algae some odwalla customers said they were unsettled by the outbreak but argued that pasteurization would kill the juice s fresh flavor and reduce its vitamin content commercial juices taste like you 're drinking corn syrup and water , said rachel koch , a 29yearold seattle bookstore employee shopping at puget consumers cooperative , a large healthfood chain odwalla makes me feel like i'm drinking a glass of vitamins juices processed with heat lose at least 30 percent of their nutrients along with the enzymes that help you absorb them , odwalla officials said terry and kelley beverly , whose 2 1 2yearold son is hospitalized with kidney failure at children s hospital in seattle after contracting the bacterium , were not aware of the risks associated with unpasterized juices on oct 22 , mr beverly said , he and his son engaged in a sunday ritual that he now regrets we would walk to a coffee shop to pick up the sunday paper , and michael always got a cookie and an apple juice before we headed home , he said after he got sick , we thought for sure that he had contracted e coli from the hamburger he had eaten that week

anaheim , calif , nov 30 ed o'bannon was as visible and familiar here as a palm tree , a part of the cool , soothing scenery and a towering fixture in the los angeles area he was a star and they like their stars around here he was a bright and beloved basketball player whose talent could make beach bums come in from the sun to find a seat in a gymnasium and yet , few will notice as he ducks in and out of town tonight , when the nets \( 29 \) play the clippers \( 69 \) and he understands that he is a national basketball association backup , often the 10th man for the nets it is a reason he does not feel compelled to buy a section of seats for his friends and for everyone who knew him when his cottony touch and gritty rebounding led ucla to a national title , sending shivers up the spines of the sunglass crowd i did n't get that many tickets , o'bannon said a lot of people do n't want to come see me sit on the bench it s as simple as that so , people really do n't even bother coming out i 'd rather it be that way , anyway if i'm not going to play and i'm not complaining but i'm just saying that since i'm not , it s better this way this way , none of his friends would leave disappointed if they did not see o'bannon playing , a sight that has faded since he started the first five games of this season he was quickly nudged farther and farther down the bench when john calipari s threeguard lineup often made the small forward obsolete , and when the coach began playing reggie williams as the first forward off the bench for whatever reason perhaps a lack of aggressiveness sensed by calipari o'bannon has been stuck with cameos in blowouts with the game against the utah jazz out of hand last monday , he entered the fourth quarter and made four consecutive 3pointers a college touch revisited but that glimpse did not change his seating position for the nets' next two games , losses at phoenix on wednesday and at golden state on thursday he may catch a break tonight against the clippers , with calipari aware of o'bannon s ties to the area i'm one of those guys where if you go home , i 'll give you an opportunity to play some , said calipari , who was expected to make o'bannon the first forward off the bench against the clippers that s how i am obviously , we 're trying to win the game if he plays well , he 'll get a lot of minutes somehow , calipari s reason for playing o'bannon seems based more on sympathy than on confidence and it is odd , because only a month ago calipari was so supportive of o'bannon this is o'bannon s year , he repeated after a strong preseason , o'bannon slipped along with the rest of the team , but he did not recover enough in calipari s eyes that means that every chance o'bannon gets , he has to make it an attentiongetting performance that s the pressure , and i have to deal with it , said o'bannon , who played one minute against golden state and was 0 for 1 my time is very limited and i do n't have any room for error , not like other players a lot of those guys can play loose it is difficult to stay loose on the bench and that is the last place anyone expected o'bannon to be after two years as a pro , especially those who saw him in college but o'bannon does not bemoan his present state my parents did n't raise me that way , he said because there could come a time when he will get a fresh start his name is often brought up in possible trade scenarios while he is not begging to leave , if he ended up on the west coast again , that would not be a bad thing for him he likes it here just being back in familiar surroundings gets me fired up , o'bannon said i'm glad to be back just to play would have sufficed tonight i miss playing , o'bannon said i do n't miss the old times , really i just miss dominating and playing real loose it s not like , 'hey , i wish i was back at ucla' that s not the case at all i 'd just like to have a chance to get out there on the floor and get off the bench rebounds john williamson , a player who helped lead the nets to championship glory in the american basketball association , died saturday at yale university hospital in new haven he was 45 he had spent the last eight years on dialysis williamson s no 23 is one of five uniform numbers the nets have retired williamson scored 40 points in atlanta on april 2 , 1978 and followed with a 50point game in the nets next game against indiana on april 4 he began his career with the nets in 1973 , when he was named to the aba allrookie team two years after the nets joined the nba , he led the team in scoring with a 222 average in the 19781979 season he played for the nets until he was traded to washington in 1980 photo john calipari diagramming a play for ed o'bannon \( 31 \) , who has gone from a nets starter to 10th man this season , and kerry kittles , right \( chang w lee the new york times \)
the life of god \( as told by himself \) by franco ferrucci translated by raymond rosenthal and franco ferrucci 283 pp chicago the university of chicago press 22 where does intelligence stop and intelligible reality continue \? we can draw that boundary easily when we look on weaker minds than our own we can see that the world as a puppy understands it is not the world as it is and that human intelligence grasps this difference while canine intelligence does not the puppy sniffs everywhere , but this difference is one thing he will never sniff out yet if an intelligence higher than ours is operative in the universe , is it not plausible to suppose that we , like the puppy , shall never sniff it out \? that we shall never grasp how it grasps the limitations of our own intelligence \? this possibility is the intellectual premise of franco ferrucci s new novel there is an emotional premise as well have you ever loved a puppy \? have you ever felt the puppy struggling to understand what you were saying to him , not understanding it , understanding nothing of it , but somehow eager \? if so , you are quite unlike me , for i eschew such transactions as rebarbative sentimentality , emotional retardation and yet who can deny it \? they happen and if they happen downward , why may they not happen upward \? imagine mankind wagging its intellectual tail , inept and essentially innocent even when on the attack , but full of aspiration imagine god facing this tail wagger well , you get the idea in the life of god written in italian and translated by raymond rosenthal and the author mr ferrucci imagines god suffering like this over the limitations of human intelligence his god emerges from primal chaos , creates the cosmos , recognizes that his creation is monstrously flawed , then discovers that he has lost control of it its correction can only come from within but from where within \? amid all that rotation of boulders in the void , i saw the small , derisory grain in the cosmic forest as the shelter of my only possible hope earth ! earth was the flower of hope to which the cosmos had given birth on earth , the vehicle of hope is a monkey , zita , but god does not manage zita s evolution god can only respond often with wonder to what his creation evolves into on its own an animal still unknown to me , approaching on its two legs but did n't it resemble zita \? that was zita all right , judging from its eyes but what a change ! this moment comes 50 pages into a 280page book what lies ahead is a highly eclectic , god seye history of western thought \( counting biblical history as western \) told in a blinking , whathavewehere manner in succession , assuming various human guises and having various picaresque adventures , god encounters moses , parmenides , heraclitus , buddha \( the one eastern intruder \) , jesus , augustine , isidore of seville , francis of assisi , thomas aquinas , dante , columbus , galileo , shakespeare , caravaggio and mozart god is intermittently delighted but ultimately frustrated none of these heroes of the human spirit really gets it a closing sprint takes us in 50 swirling pages from 1750 to the present via rousseau , holderlin , melville , freud and einstein transitions are deus ex machina throughout often god simply loses consciousness and awakens in a new place and time what is consistent is god s gnostic vision the world , including himself , can be saved from disintegration only by selfunderstanding only mankind can achieve this cosmic selfunderstanding therefore , only mankind can save the world but mankind fails to seize this question time after time , genius after genius , the human puppy is just not clever enough the divine comedy thus becomes a gently wistful tragedy with a sigh , god issues himself a oneway speedoflight ticket to the borders of the universe , where i want to rest in the late ripeness of my years born in italy , now a professor of literature at rutgers university , franco ferrucci has written a work in which some might hear echoes of benedetto croce s neohegelian triumph history brought under the general concept of art \( 1893 \) but a century after croce , it is biological rather than philosophical evolution darwin rather than hegel that defines the most widely accepted general vision of reality as pierre teilhard de chardin put it , man is not the center of the universe as was naively believed in the past , but something much more beautiful man the ascending arrow of the great biological synthesis though mentioning neither hegel nor darwin , mr ferrucci , in effect , fuses their visions but writes his own ending for him , the ascending arrow is now in descent earth , in all its majesty , is beyond repair god will miss it it wo n't be easy to abandon such beauty but he can do nothing about it there are those who , as their own lives lengthen , take melancholy comfort in the thought that the world too is no longer in its youth this is perhaps a book written mostly for them rather than for any species of philosopher , biologist or theologian the life of god is , in truth , the synthesis of a charming writer s italycentered education and the expression of his boundless hopes for , and poignant disappointment in , his own human kind drawing
grozny , russia , aug 13 there is only one open road left into this city it is a long series of bomb craters , really , mixed with dirt , mud and occasionally some asphalt the road starts in the deep woods just southwest of town and runs straight toward the ravaged center the road has no name , but it does not need one , because everybody knows what it is there for it is the last , harrowing route to safety each day for thousands of anguished refugees who have been driven from their homes here in the capital of chechnya by war and death , and it is the best entry route for the secessionist rebels who now reign over most of the city winding through twisted trees , past ruined houses and down the middle of one of russia s largest but long unused oil refineries , the path has become a surreal chechen version of the ho chi minh trail the right side is filled with pathetic , broken cars edging through the mud , piled high with boxes and always waving white flags ripped from sheets the left lane is for the separatists , often walking in groups of less than 10 or driving in flatbed trucks like those used by many refugees to flee the burning city today , a walk from the nearest village , alkhanyurt , into grozny was a treacherous journey , with helicopter gunships hovering in the distance , russian planes screeching across the steelgray skies and a column of tanks to the west firing rounds at random but the rebels moved along it , seemingly unfazed they ca n't touch us here , said imran agimelzoya , 16 , carrying a gun almost as large as he was and wearing a chicago bulls cap , as he made his way along the muddy path toward chernorechye , the southwest part of grozny the russians have tanks at every other entrance to the city , but they really ca n't stop us here it is now clear that the russians are losing badly in their second battle for grozny in the last two years what began as a rebel hitandrun intended to humiliate president boris n yeltsin for his failed promises of peace has turned into something like a conquest chechen commanders here say they originally planned to teach mr yeltsin a lesson by showing the vulnerability of a city that has been a russian redoubt since early last year , and then withdraw after they made their point but now , they say , having captured grozny and other chechen cities so easily in the last week , they have no intention of pulling out , and plan to hold on until the russians withdraw from the republic this is our city , said akhmed zakayev , the national security adviser to the separatist government and one of its top commanders why should we leave it again \? although the two sides announced a ceasefire to begin on wednesday the latest in a series of such announcements , none honored for long today the fighting continued in the center jets and helicopters unleashed their assault on the chechen separatists who stormed the city a week ago and have taken effective control of it yet there are no russian soldiers wandering the streets of the city only the chechen fighters dare to do that under the overall command of shamil basayev , who led the infamous raid last year on the southern russian city of budyonnovsk , the separatists have split grozny into five parts and they appear to be running all five mr zakayev agreed to speak to a reporter today in his temporary headquarters , a graceful former oldage home in the leafy chernorechye section for two days , russian bombers have attacked the neighborhood , in part because they know mr zakayev is there in the west , mr zakayev , a former chechen culture minister , is not well known but for more than a year he led the fighting for the mountain village of bamut , generally considered to be among the fiercest battles of the war now he has 1 , 000 hungry and forelorn russian troops surrounded in their barracks only 500 yards from his office mr zakayev said his orders from aslan maskhadov , the chechen military chief of staff , were to keep the russians pinned down but not to attack when they come out and surrender , we will put them to use , mr zakayev said until then we will keep them surrounded one of his lieutenants , looking slightly uncomfortable , added , they are starving to death like flies mr zakayev s headquarters resembles a school for wayward boys scores of heavily armed teenagers are constantly running in and out of the base they play with grenades and rocket launchers as if they were baseballs and lacrosse sticks but they always do exactly what they are told mr zakayev said he had great military respect for aleksandr i lebed , the russian national security adviser who returned from a quick trip to the region on monday full of praise for the rebels' tenacity and scorn for the way the russian government was waging the war that is nice , mr zakayev said but we lost hope long ago in the russian side they have never fulfilled a single treaty or promise so i was happy to hear that lebed says we are brave and that his soldiers are badly treated i am not sure , though , he can do anything to solve our problem the chechen separatists are still well armed and seem extremely well organized they say they never permit their soldiers to fight for more than a few days in a row , and routinely rotate troops mr zakayev used a newmodel motorola radio , decorated with a sticker of the wolf , the symbol of the chechen people , to communicate with his staff during the interview he received word that one of the russianinstalled leaders of the chechen government was trying to escape the city on the back of a tractor he quickly issued orders to have him picked up despite the talk of a truce and the fact that the fighting , while continuous , was less intense than yesterday s , separatists said a truce was unlikely none of the residents fleeing the burning city held out much hope of a halt in the war you look at that , said andrei usayov , who with his family of six was walking the path to alkhanyurt , as he pointed at the huge black plumes of oil and smoke shooting into the sky above his city i have seen everything in grozny i want to see they can never bring peace to a place like this photos in grozny , capital of the secessionist region of chechnya in southern russia , a rebel fighter walked past the bodies of russian soldiers on monday the russians are losing their second battle for the city in two years \( associated press \) \( pg a6 \) a group of chechen women , pushing their belongings , flee grozny \( agence francepresse \) \( pg a1 \) map of grozny showing location of chernorechye \( pg a6 \)

charles wadsworth already had a national reputation as the man who had brought chamber music to the masses when he made a surprise visit to his hometown , newnan , ga , in the mid1970 s he had been touring the south with the soprano beverly sills as her accompanist , and she had insisted on the detour to that sleepy hamlet , 30 miles southwest of atlanta , having arranged a homecoming dinner for him at sprayberry s restaurant the elder mr sprayberry took to miss sills immediately then he peered at her escort say , charlie , he asked after a while you still playing the piano \? it took the chambermusic revolution a little longer to catch on in newnan , the city of homes , so called for the architectural gems that sprouted during the cotton boom of the 1920 s but revenge has been sweet for mr wadsworth his picture now hangs on the wall of fame at the newnancoweta chamber of commerce , next to that of the countrymusic sensation alan jackson and at his 50th highschool reunion this spring , as he sat on the dais with the class s football hero , grown portly , mr wadsworth could n't help but gloat a bit look at me now , he said in his honeyed drawl i'm the one going to the olympics at 67 , his blue eyes still dancing , his shock of blond hair a touch grayer , mr wadsworth has lost none of the charm he practiced while serenading ladies' clubs as a boy in newnan it was largely his skill as a raconteur that lured audiences into alice tully hall , when chamber music was still an untouchable art form , during his two decades as artistic director of the chamber music society of lincoln center , a post he left in 1989 it is the same garrulous charm he has plied for two decades as host of the chamber series of the spoleto festival usa in charleston , sc on monday , july 22 , mr wadsworth will test the international scope of his downhome manner as the artistic director of an olympic celebration of chamber music at symphony hall in atlanta , part of the multidisciplinary olympic arts festival , the musical portion of which begins on monday and significantly , in a game where bigger generally translates into broader audience appeal , mr wadsworth s intimate chamber program sprinted ahead of the pack , selling out within two days , when tickets went on sale last september we were thrilled , said jeffrey babcock , the festival s director he s in a way a hometown boy , and this is a great opportunity for him to come home as one of this country s most distinguished artistic directors mr babcock offered mr wadsworth the position three years ago , stipulating only that the event be extraordinarily exciting but how to appeal to an audience of 2 , 600 whose interests were likely to be centered on sports rather than classical music \? i had no reason to be modest here , mr wadsworth said of his handpicked roster , which includes the violinists itzhak perlman , pinchas zukerman , jaime laredo and robert mcduffie , a fellow georgian the violists nobuko imai and ida kavafian the cellists lynn harrell and sharon robinson , and the mezzosoprano frederica von stade it s an incredible matched set , just a group of huge , virtuosic performers atlanta was indeed mr wadsworth s second home at 12 , he took up piano lessons there with hugh hodgson , who had founded the music department at the university of georgia in the 1930 s hodgson instilled in his pupil an extraordinarily beautiful sound that i carry always in my ear , mr wadsworth said he also passed on his passion for chamber music mr wadsworth followed his mentor to the athens campus of the university and transferred two years later to the juilliard school in new york in 1959 , having established a career in new york as an accompanist and coach , he joined the composer gian carlo menotti at the festival of two worlds in spoleto , italy , directing the chamber series in this rarefied atmosphere , mr wadsworth met alice tully , a singer of modest talent who loved chamber repertory in 1965 , another composer , william schuman , who was the first president of lincoln center , approached mr wadsworth with plans for a chamber series in a new hall underwritten by tully it was an instant meeting of the minds , said mr wadsworth by 1969 , the three had created the chamber music society , the first organization in the united states dedicated to furthering the genre more than 1 , 000 concerts later , in 1989 , mr wadsworth knew it was time to retire he had grown weary of the pressure of juggling administrative duties and performing it was a decision he says he has never regretted , in part because it has allowed him to diversify his talents and energy the pressure and constraints behind him , he is busier than ever among the festivals , performances and master classes he commits to each year is the charles wadsworth concert , presented in newnan each february during a tour of homes the series , which takes place in a crumbling 1939 auditorium , was the town s gift to a favorite son on his resignation from the society the concerts have evolved into a proving ground for young artists on their way to spoleto usa , and a stoppingoff point for more established artists who , like miss sills , have been seduced by newnan s southern smalltown ways the south is still very much ingrained in me , mr wadsworth said i 've lived in another world most of my life , but this is home photo charles wadsworth at home in new york the south is still very much ingrained in me \( andrea mohin the new york times \)
san jose , calif , oct 6 just a few more seconds and the islanders would have accomplished their goal a 500 west coast road trip to open the season in reality , it was 154 seconds that was what the scoreboard clock read saturday night when bernie nicholls , in his debut with the san jose sharks , threaded a slap shot from the right circle between an exhausted darius kasparaitis and an unlucky tommy salo for a 22 tie in a game the islanders should have won instead they opened the season 011 i think a little bit of it is we 're not used to winning , said marty mcinnis , who ought to know but , mcinnis was asked , are n't you a little tired of saying that \? yes , mcinnis said but , i mean , it s true it was also true that after going 0 for 8 on the power play against the kings on friday night , the islanders went 0 for 9 here they also had at least three good chances to clear the puck in the closing moments before nicholls beat salo mcinnis had one , as did scott lachance , as did kasparaitis none cleared it and , as the islanders tried to weather an extra attacker in nicholls at the end of what must have seemed like an endless shift more than one islander on the ice estimated the shift at about two minutes nicholls walked across the slot from the left point , after taking a crossice backhand dig from owen nolan at the far boards , and then scored they had no business getting a point out of the game , islanders coach mike milbury said but , in a sense , we got what we deserved because we failed to clear the puck , and we had opportunities to do it but that s ok , because we 've got to learn how to deal with that situation we 're extremely young and it s sort of a microcosm of what to expect down by a goal , up by a goal i hope it s like that all year long i may have a heart attack before it s over but you give up three goals in two games on the road , you 're doing something right the islanders lost to los angeles by 10 on friday i thought the team played better tonight than they did last night , which i appreciated , being backtoback games , milbury said i'm disappointed we did n't get 500 on the road that s your objective all the time you play 500 hockey on the road , then you 're going to be in pretty good shape the islanders are going to have a hard time doing that but there are reasons to be optimistic after these first two games their defense was solid , their goaltending strong the 19yearold rookie bryan berard made a beautiful rush and an even prettier pass to set up derek king s first goal of the season and give berard his first national hockey league point it also gave the islanders a 21 lead dan plante scored the islanders' first goal shorthanded on his 25th birthday then there was salo , who made 21 saves in his first start of the season , and was adequate , though little tested in other words , just about everything the islanders did this weekend was encouraging , except for their power play on the islanders' final man advantage , todd bertuzzi took a penalty in the overtime to negate the final 1 minute 45 seconds of a fiveminute major , something milbury would later call a stupid mistake but , as lachance said last year , maybe we would have lost in overtime just as they will take the point , the islanders will take all the positives they can slap shots mike milbury spoke saturday night about where he stands with don meehan , the agent for the restricted free agent travis green i talked to meehan yesterday , milbury said i'm going to try to fool around with some bonuses and see what happens but he s going to be sadly disappointed if he thinks i'm moving off my hard numbers san jose s darren turcotte sprained his right knee after getting entangled with darius kasparaitis behind the net after kasparaitis had delivered a clean hit al iafrate , who assisted on the sharks' gametying goal , was playing in the regular season for the first time since may 11 , 1994 iafrate had been plagued by knee injuries the last two seasons

washington , sept 29 congress s four top leaders argued over medicare , tax cuts , education and poison gas tonight , giving the uncertain congressional elections unique national visibility and displaying a calm civility rarely seen on the floor of either house or senate as this session ends we have delivered for the american people , said senator trent lott of mississippi , the majority leader , answering the opening question why republicans should be returned to power with a litany of recent legislative accomplishments , including welfare , immigration and health insurance but representative richard a gephardt of missouri , the house minority leader , contended that republicans had sought to cut school lunches , head start and student loans and had forfeited their right to power we have got to deal with people s practical , everyday problems , he said the firstofitskind national debate was televised on hundreds of publictelevision stations from the colonialera house of burgesses in williamsburg , va , and was followed or preceded by dozens of comparable exchanges between senate and house candidates around the country tonight s debate , five weeks before the election , preceded by one week the first of three debates between presidential and vicepresidential candidates if none of the exchanges compared even faintly to the prerevolutionary oratory heard in this same hall from patrick henry and others , the impression of thoughtfulness conveyed was far different from the shouting , insults and booing that typify much of the house debate seen on cspan these days apparently sensing the potential of the gentler approach , senator tom daschle of south dakota , the minority leader , used the debate s last moments not for partisan claims but to say , the people want the decibel level to come down he said , what we need is working together , reaching across the aisle but the civility did not overwhelm their mission of scoring on the issues each side thought would play best with voters watching on the relatively staid pbs speaker newt gingrich , opening the discussion on foreign policy , said the first priority was to defeat drugs , an issue he returned to several times and the first time mr gephardt got the microphone he issued a familiar attack , saying , the republicans tried to cut medicare to pay for tax cuts for the wealthiest americans but mr gingrich , who often uses the word lie to dispute that contention , reacted only by repeatedly explaining that spending for medicare would have increased under the republican budget plan , though not as quickly as without it it s a cut if you ca n't buy the same amount of health care , snapped mr daschle it s a cut if your premiums go up the argument over tax cuts recurred and was practically the only occasion when the issues of the presidential campaign directly intruded into the congressional debate the two republicans praised and the two democrats attacked the plan by bob dole , the republican presidential candidate , for a 15percent tax cut mr gingrich said it would provide 105 more per month for a family of four earning 30 , 000 mr lott said it was part of the republican concept of quality of life the opportunity to keep more of your own money but mr daschle said sweeping tax cuts of that sort would increase the deficit , as they had in the 1980 s , and he called the plan dejavoodoo economics mr gephardt said the republicans' tax cuts would mainly help the rich , saying , we believe tax cuts should be focused on middleincome americans , and people trying to get into the middle class mr gephardt complained about cuts in spending for education , in which he included the public broadcasting system s own sesame street mr lott replied that the 443 billion catchall spending bill the senate is expected to approve on monday actually provides increases in education money that s an electionyear conversion , mr daschle said mr gingrich argued that money for education was not as much of a problem as how it was spent we spend far too much money on bureaucracy and not enough on teachers , he said in his approach he repeatedly praised teachers , perhaps seeking to distance himself from attacks on them at the republican national convention ridiculing washington s own school system , he said it spent 9 , 000 a year per pupil but had too many bureaucrats to teach them well or even to attend to maintenance like repairing boilers and roofs congress sought to fix that this weekend with an extra 12 million , but specified that it could not be managed by regular school administration officials but instead by the financial control board that congress set up last year to try to straighten out the city s messy finances where mr gingrich had cited drugs as a first priority in foreign policy , mr daschle said congress s duty was to consent to ratification of the chemical weapons convention , which would prohibit manufacture , sale and use of poison gas mr lott complained that compliance with the pact could not be verified , and mr gingrich said , in foreign policy , words are n't enough , you 've got to have deeds the two sides squabbled over campaign finance legislation mr gephardt challenged the republicans to support limits on money raised and spent , playing on mr gingrich s argument last year that the system needed more money , not less mr gingrich hit back by denouncing money spent by the aflcio to work against republican freshmen , saying the supreme court would prohibit limits on that sort of campaign spending this money is dues money that is coerced , mr gingrich said that s not true , said mr gephardt mr gingrich was correct the bulk of the aflcio s spending this year comes from a special assessment added to regular union dues , and approved at a special convention of the labor federation last winter aside from taxes , the only direct reference to the presidential campaign came when jim lehrer of pbs , the moderator , asked what the relationship between the presidential and congressional races was mr lott pointed to the measures president clinton had vetoed , and said we need a president who will work with us to get this job done but he never mentioned mr dole s name in that context mr daschle breezed by the clinton connection , saying this president is going to be reelected then he made his appeal for civility after the debate , mr gingrich told reporters that these productions by pbs were significant because they bring a lot more attention to congressional races it is , after all , he said , the first branch of government mentioned in the constitution we got the politics away from the 30second attack commercial into at least a relatively reasonable dialogue republicans had argued to have the participants seated , and mr lott told reporters that that may have contributed to the tenor of the session when you put people behind podiums , and you put them in spearthrowing posture , they 're more inclined to do that , he said it calmed the format down and brought it more into a dialogue , rather than sound bites but the democrats also said they thought they had gained in their effort to nationalize this year s elections , as republicans successfully did in 1994 it s not just 435 local elections , he said there s a national set of issues that should be discussed i'm optimistic that a counterwave is going to happen in 1996 photo before last night s debate , jim lehrer , center , briefed congressional leaders , from left , speaker newt gingrich , senator trent lott

washington , jan 24 millions of those who watched president clinton deliver his state of the union message on tuesday did not stay tuned to hear the response that senator bob dole presented after the address perhaps , republicans around the nation said today , that was just as well on the day after the first real broadcast duel between the two leading candidates for president , mr dole said he felt good about his 10minute appearance and added , i would n't change a word an aide said his office had received more than 2 , 000 calls by the end of the day , and that the response was overwhelmingly positive but among a flock of republican figures , consultants and even a few voters , the consensus was that mr dole got swamped by the more telegenic mr clinton and on the campaign trail in iowa , mr dole s rivals seized on his performance to denounce the frontrunner in the race for the republican presidential nomination as uninspired and bereft of vision it is clear to me that we are not going to beat bill clinton by matching our empty rhetoric against his , one of mr dole s opponents , senator phil gramm of texas , told about 200 listeners in cedar falls to be sure , none of the critics took issue with the substance of mr dole s message , which was republican and conservative to the core , but with its presentation they said mr dole s sharp criticism of mr clinton sounded shrill after the president s more conciliatory 61minute address , with its salute to mr dole s wartime service they said the staging , in an otherwise empty room with the camera at a distance , made him look old and tired next to the tight closeups of a vigorous mr clinton in a wildly cheering chamber they groused that he stumbled over phrases the conservative talkshow host rush limbaugh called him lackluster one new york republican official likened him to a television commercial for batteries in which families of plastic dolls run out of power and become immobile among some voters and party officials in iowa , where mr dole campaigned today , the reviews were poor as well it was an absolute disaster , said roger linn , the republican chairman for the county that contains sioux city by god , he had a week or two to prepare and he could n't even read it if this is the beginning of the campaign , clinton could quit right now , because he s got it but it is not the beginning of the campaign not the one against mr clinton , anyway and that may be mr dole s saving grace for while many republicans savaged his performance , they also agreed that it probably would not do him lasting damage responses to state of the union speeches almost never get much attention from the general public , and even when they do , they tend to be quickly forgotten about 26 million households tuned into mr clinton s speech on the three major networks , an official of one network said today that official said viewing plummeted once the president had finished these are incredibly hard things to do , said robert teeter , a republican pollster and a veteran political adviser there s no way you can stage anybody , in any place , to compete with the president in a joint session the best you can do is write a speech that gives your views and ignores his mr dole did that while mr clinton spoke to the electorate at large , sketching a selfportrait of moderation , mr dole addressed republican primary voters who like conservative rhetoric , and got what they wanted to hear he called mr clinton the last public defender of a discredited status quo , the rear guard of the welfare state , and a dogged friend of liberals given that , republicans generally agreed that mr dole did a workmanlike job of explaining the differences between republicans and mr clinton , even as the president appropriated some of their issues as his own kenneth m duberstein , a republican political adviser who was chief of staff to president reagan , said mr dole argued in a clear and convincing way that there are two visions , and that the republican vision is in the ascendancy still , many agreed with the conclusion of david tell , opinion editor for the conservative magazine the weekly standard and a former republican campaign official , that mr dole s remarks read better than they appeared as a public performance , he was not flattered in comparison to the president , mr tell said in person , mr dole is widely seen as a friendly if not effusive man with a politician s personal skills and a razorsharp wit but no one has ever called him a stirring orator , and his parched humor and monotone delivery seem to lose any warmth on the trip to the television s small screen his difficulties with television made a poor performance in the 1988 republican primaries worse one of the principal arguments raised against him by his republican rivals in this race is that his skills were inadequate to defeat a master television campaigner like mr clinton but after an early spate of doubts , mr dole has gradually attained the image of a candidate who was unbeatable in the race for his party s presidential nomination , if not dynamic , and nothing much has arisen that would permit his rivals to revive the old doubts until now , perhaps mr dole s speech was topic a on the republican campaign trail lamar alexander , whose candidacy has been mired with mr gramm s in the single digits in most polls , took a shot at mr dole in omaha , whose newspapers and broadcast outlets reach well into western iowa any republican who watched the two speeches last night must be thinking the same thing , he told the omaha rotary club president clinton can fake a compelling vision , while senator dole is too decent to try to fake a vision he does not have and steve forbes , the publisher who has come closest to mr dole in the polls , called mr dole s speech an opportunity that was not fully taken advantage of the candidates' hope , of course , was that mr dole s apparent stumble would drive support away from him and to one of them but among some republicans who were interviewed today , the principal effect of mr dole s speech appeared to be to rekindle another old longing for colin powell , the retired army general who flirted with a republican presidential campaign last year i want someone to be president who truly knows why he wants to be president , and not just that he deserves it , said representative christopher shays , a connecticut republican , one of three people who mentioned mr powell in their analysis of mr dole s speech i want to see the passion for what our country should be
samuel beckett the complete short prose , 19291989 by samuel beckett edited and with an introduction and notes by s e gontarski 294 pages grove press 23 in the end , one of the fictional centerpieces of this illuminating new collection of prose , can be glimpsed the lineaments of samuel beckett s entire career his preoccupation with the absurdity of the human condition his dark , vaudevillian humor his characters' fear that something awful would happen and their realization that they lack the courage to end or the strength to go on this story , written in 1946 \( five years before molloy and six years before waiting for godot \) , recounts the tale of an unnamed tramp , who has been inexplicably expelled from a safe refuge \( the womb \? a hospital \? a prison \? \) and who is forced to wander aimlessly through a dark , kafkaesque world eventually , this narrator finds shelter in a small abandoned shack , where he converts an old boat into a kind of coffinlike bed there , increasingly oblivious to the outside world , he allows his mind to wander back and forth through his past , as he awaits the inevitable approach of death it s a story that not only embodies the central themes of beckett s mature fiction but also prefigures the overall movement of his work toward minimalism and stasis as the beckett scholar s e gontarski observes in his introduction , the complete short prose gathers the entire output of beckett s short fiction , with the exception of the interlinked stories included in more pricks than kicks and the 1933 coda to that collection , echo s bones the volume begins with assumption , beckett s first published story , which appeared in transition magazine in 1929 \( when he was 23 \) , and concludes with stirrings still , a series of three short pieces written shortly before his death in 1989 taken together , the prose pieces do a remarkably succinct job of charting beckett s philosophical evolution , while at the same time shedding new light on the development of the distinctive voice he would employ in his betterknown novels and plays although the first four entries in this volume already evince some decidedly beckettian touches assumption begins with the sentence , he could have shouted and could not they tend to feel like the apprentice works of a young writer , playing with different models and techniques a case in a thousand \( 1934 \) , which recounts a bizarre encounter between a doctor and his former nanny , reads like a contrived o henryesque exercise adorned with some heavyhanded freudian touches , while sedendo et quiescendo , an excerpt from the stalled novel dream of fair to middling women , reads more like a bad parody of joyce , complete with streamofconscious ramblings and silly obscene wordplay with the end , the expelled , first love and the calmative , however , beckett comes into his own in a sudden , startling leap these 1946 stories , which herald the beginning of an enormously productive period that would later produce eleutheria , godot and a trilogy of novels , all deal explicitly or elliptically with the theme of exile and expulsion they are parables , in a sense , of man s expulsion from the garden of eden , of his fall from grace , though in beckett s world , god has been elusive , perhaps nonexistent , from the start in each of these stories , the narrator finds himself wandering , without direction , in a vaguely menacing landscape , seeking shelter , protection or something that might calm his nerves there are occasional acts of kindness \( a cabdriver offers a place to stay the night , a prostitute offers love , a child offers a sweet \) and occasional sightings of beauty \( a hyacinth blooming in a pot , geraniums on a windowsill \) , and yet they do not assuage the loneliness of the protagonist or his realization that life is a long , potholeridden road toward the grave this bareboned sense of narrative disappears completely in beckett s later writings , which accelerate the processes of distillation , reduction and attenuation begun earlier in his career , a development underscored by the titles of such later pieces as lessness \( 1969 \) and enough \( 1965 \) as the idea of linearity vanishes , so does the sense of life having a beginning , middle and end instead , we are given static images or metaphors that recall those employed in plays like endgame \( which featured a pair of characters confined to ashcans \) and happy days \( which depicted the heroine buried up to her neck in a mound of earth \) life as imprisonment , life as entrapment , life as a no exit kind of hell all strange away \( 19634 \) conjures up a box \( or stage set \) that s 5 feet square and 6 feet high with no way in , none out ping \( 1966 \) depicts an individual confined to a white space that vaguely resembles a prison or asylum cell white walls 1 yard by 2 white ceiling 1 square yard never seen bare white body fixed only the eyes only just and the lost ones \( 1966 \) describes life inside a flattened cylinder 50 meters round and 16 high , a cylinder in which bodies contend with one another for hegemony , vying for the use of broken ladders that offer only the faintest hope of escape texts for nothing \( 195052 \) and fizzles \( 197375 \) , series of short pieces that are numbered rather than titled , are even more enigmatic , offering the reader only strobelike glimpses of a disembodied consciousness , floundering about in the muck of human existence though these pieces are related to such later theater works as footfalls and rockaby , their effect on the reader is blunted by the fact that there is no performer to give the words a verbal or physical inflection in texts for nothing , no 4 , the narrator simply announces the limits of language , declaring a story is not compulsory , just a life , that s the mistake i made , one of the mistakes , to have wanted a story for myself , whereas life alone is enough but while beckett seems to be saying that narratives are obsolete in a random , fragmented world , his later writings also attest to what he once called the obligation to express while it may no longer be possible for human beings to connect all the dots of their experience , he suggests , it is still possible to speak , to count , to observe , to make distinctions , such as the straitest narrow , the loudest fall , the most lingering collapse , the steepest descent , the greatest number of successive turns the same way , the greatest fatigue , the longest rest , the longest aside from the sound of the body on its way silence as beckett puts it in another story , only the words break the silence , all other sounds have ceased
tooele , utah , aug 30 when the big 650 million factory finally started crunching up chemical weapons here in the utah desert a week ago , the army boasted that it was using some of the most advanced technology in the world to destroy some of the most lethal weapons ever created but the army had no sooner started turning a halfcenturyold stockpile of nerve gas and blistering agents into benign vapor than the nation s first chemical weapons disposal plant was shut down a small amount of sarin nerve gas , the agent used by terrorists in a tokyo subway attack last year , was found where it should not have been in the endoftheline filters that clean factory air before releasing it into the desert skies just southwest of salt lake city the technology may be advanced , but what appears to have bedeviled the tooele chemical agent disposal facility was probably something as simple as leaky gaskets , plant managers said initially , army officials said the sealed fortress would be back in operation within a day or so but after being closed five days , the plant started up again on friday afternoon plant officials said the leak of gas had posed no health risk to workers or to the public but as the army prepares to expand its longdelayed , 12 billion program to destroy the nation s chemical weapons through incineration to seven other communities around the nation , the problem here has raised some fresh fears all eyes are on the plant at tooele \( pronounced tooellah \) , not only because it is the first and most advanced of the chemicalweaponsdestroying factories that will be in operation through 2004 or longer , but because this is the plant where the glitches were supposed to be worked out before it started up the plant is operated by a contractor , eg and g defense materials inc , under the army s oversight in destroying chemical weapons , there is little room for error a single drop of a nerve agent like sarin can kill a person a major release into the air would kill 1 in 10 people within a 40mile radius , according to some projections the army has more than 30 , 000 tons of chemical agents stored in bunkers around the country almost half of the weapons , about 44 percent of the entire stockpile , are here in world war ii era tombs near this fastgrowing town 45 miles from salt lake city in court hearings a month ago , where opponents tried to stop the tooele plant from opening , top army officials asserted that all the mechanical problems associated with the startup of a new factory had already been discovered and corrected they said there should never be a release of the lethal chemicals into the air the chemical agents are drained from missiles and bombs , then burned after being brought into the plant the weapons are chopped up the air from the factory is filtered of chemical agents and then cleaned again before it is vented , the army says for critics of the plant and the entire government plan to burn chemical weapons , the small release here has prompted a new round of toldyouso warnings they have got some serious problems at that plant , said steven w jones , the former chief safety officer at tooele , who was dismissed in 1994 after he became an outspoken critic my feeling is that it is just a matter of time before somebody gets hurt the release at the filter vents is exactly what mr jones predicted in his safety reports , he said i warned that chemical agent would migrate to places where it should n't be , he said in an interview by the time that air reaches the vents , it should be clean but factory managers , while conceding that the release was not according to plan , say that their numerous safety backup systems worked to alert people of even a small release and that the chemical had been contained within the vestibules surrounding the filters added as an extra precaution a team of federal scientists brought in this week to analyze what went wrong concluded on friday that the leak had most likely been caused by uneven air pressure forcing a buildup of the chemical agent in the filters , which then leaked into the final containment vestibules it can be corrected by adjusting the air pressure , they said i am confident we will not see a major problem , timothy w thomas , the tooele project manager , said in an interview none of the 600 or so workers here were exposed to chemical agents , he said as for mr jones s criticism , mr thomas said , he does n't know what he s talking about in dismantling the first 205 of about 30 , 000 rockets , land mines and bombs stored at tooele , the plant has worked as expected , except for the glitch in the filters , he said still , the release has raised some troubling questions about a persistent problem in the army s plan to defuse the nation s chemical weapons as part of a treaty with the former soviet union to destroy both nations' stockpiles on johnston island , about 800 miles south of hawaii , where the army has been destroying weapons since 1990 , there were similiar problems with filters chemical agents were released at least three times in the last six years on johnston island the army attributed the problem to faulty gaskets around the doors of the air filters no injuries were reported based on what happened on johnston island , a layer of protection the vestibules was built around the filters the army also modified the filters themselves with new gaskets , officials said in court last month but the incident last week indicates that the filter problem has still not been solved the army went and swore up and down in court that this plant in utah was ready to go and that they had worked everything out , said craig williams , a spokesman for the chemical weapons working group , based in kentucky , which represents communities that oppose the incineration of chemical weapons then , it operates for less than 72 hours and they had to shut it down he added , this program is 12 years behind schedule and 700 percent over budget they are desperately trying to keep it afloat the state of utah , long known for somewhat of a laissezfaire attitude toward business and new factories , has regulatory power over the plant we are confident that what happened does not appear to be a public threat , said dennis downs , the director of the state s division of solid and hazardous waste the small leak at the plant must be weighed against the threat of major leaks by the old weapons as they sit in earthen and concrete bunkers , he said on average , about three new leaks a week are discovered inside the igloos , as the bunkers are known as it is , the tooele plant is within an earthquake fault zone mr thomas , the plant manager , said his greatest fear was that a temblor would cause some kind of release from storage bunkers this area is fairly prone to earthquakes , mr thomas said the risk associated with just 11 days of storage is greater than the entire risk of operating our facility over the next seven years critics say there are safer alternatives to incineration , like burial deep underground after years of army secrecy , they simply do not trust the government no matter what is really going on , the army will cover it up and the state will minimize the risk until someone dies , said cindy king , a sierra club member in utah photo steam rose from a 650 million disposal plant in tooele , utah , when chemical weapons were destroyed last week a small leak of nerve gas inside the plant raised questions about its safety \( associated press \) map of utah showing the loction of

fiction writers accept the notion that they follow in the footsteps of their predecessors for travel writers , however , the metaphor suggests a serious problem the whole point of travel writing is or was to describe a place few people have visited before until quite recently , the earth offered many such places , unworked mines whose fat , tempting seams promised treasures to any brave soul with a strong back and a pick airplane travel and the cheap package tour put an end to all that now tashkent , nairobi and kuala lumpur all lie within a day s reach of new york as kingsley amis pointed out in a tart little essay , travel s democratic age has spoiled things for a certain breed of writer , the sort who for decades had been getting away with calling spain a harsh , bitter land or with nattering on about the civilization of the delicate olive at the other end of the mediterranean what to do \? some writers , unwilling to surrender the bragging rights conferred by novelty , have resorted to the gimmick book , in which the traveler sets himself a bizarre challenge \( like walking the whole 3 , 000mile coast of baja california \) or maps out an arcane itinerary \( visiting , say , every town in the united states named springfield \) others simply retrace the route taken by earlier adventurers , betting that the contrast between old and new will pay dividends and lots of them , playing the peter mayle card , simply plop down in a cute village and wait for funny people to do funny things mike tidwell , the author of the ponds of kalambayi an african sojourn \( lyons burford , paper , 1695 \) , did none of the above , with brilliant results as a peace corps volunteer , mr tidwell spent two years in the grasslands of south central zaire trying to spread the profitable message of fish farming to some of the poorest villages on the continent this book is the record of his experience mr tidwell arrives in kalambayi with high hopes and a good plan he will teach the local farmers how to dig ponds and raise fish , which will provide them with a source of income and add protein to a diet that consists mainly of fufu , a bland , squishy bread made of powdered corn and manioc his task is not easy one villager , for example , is convinced that fish will stock the ponds naturally , since they come to earth in raindrops others suspect that the fishponds are a new way for the white man to exploit their labor gradually , mr tidwell makes headway but the heart of the story lies in his growing understanding of the people and the place he has come to he picks up a spear and hunts with the men , to their great amusement he wriggles out of the invitation when a local chief , taking pity on mr tidwell s bachelor existence , offers one of his daughters in marriage he protests in vain when his fish farmers routinely give away as much as half their harvest to relatives tradition , he finds , takes precedence over the profit motive after a while , he learns to adopt the shareandsharealike philosophy of a people who never have enough with a keen eye , he picks up on the fine points of building and maintaining a mukishi , a kind of scarecrow with a distinctly african twist to keep its spirit alert and savage , kayenda began pelting its face every day with whatever sludge happened to be on hand mud , rotten fruit , ashes , flour the process was something of an art form one day i watched him pour a bucket of water over the mukishi s head while telling it that its mother was a prostitute for the most part , mr tidwell tells a tragic story poverty , disease and failure hang over his villages in the rainy season , as the stores from the previous harvest dwindle , death haunts the land mr tidwell does not flinch from tales of misery , but he lived long enough and closely enough with the people to know the whole story , the little triumphs and daily satisfactions as well as the defeats readers will be cheering for those fishponds the british travel writer jeremy seal also knows his territory , in this case turkey , where he taught english for several years and developed an obsession with the fez , the real protagonist of his first book , a fez of the heart \( harvest harcourt brace , paper , 14 \) subtitled travels around turkey in search of a hat , it takes the reader on a convoluted itinerary and a historical journey driven by mr seal s ultimately irritating belief that the soul of turkey can be found in the fez , the national headgear that replaced the turban in 1826 and , upon the orders of kemal ataturk , was outlawed in 1925 as a symbol of turkish backwardness the turks are a patient people they submit to mr seal s barrage of questions about the fez , not high on their list of interests , with good grace perhaps they , like the reader , suspect the fez is just a pretext mr seal needed an excuse to wander around turkey , the fez is it , and his turkish hosts simply have to make the best of it the book is better than its premise mr seal writes well , although he has a tendency to get purplish , and his little historical essays , scattered throughout the book , are fascinating and thoroughly researched when he takes off his fez , so to speak , mr seal does best although he is poor at describing scenery , he has the british gift for seizing upon absurdities , awkward situations and the miseries of travel his description of a wretched waiting room for the ferry at lake van sounds the note of misery with genuine feeling
for half a century , the three men had been harmonious and effective partners in the dense thickets of new york real estate they bought buildings like other m bought slacks as harry helmsley clawed his way to fame as new york s premier realestate titan , his two top lieutenants , alvin schwartz and irving schneider , became moguls in their own right the three men made up the highoctane triumvirate that stewarded the helmsleyspear realty firm , which manages such fabled commercial buildings as the empire state building and one penn plaza failing health forced mr helmsley to retreat from active participation in the late 1980 s , but the void was vociferously filled by his sharptongued wife , leona helmsley there went the harmony squabbling between mrs helmsley and her husband s two associates has flared for years , though it was subdued while mrs helmsley was serving 18 months in prison for her 1989 conviction for tax evasion but the wrangling has recently reached new heights of rancor in the latest thrust , mr schwartz and mr schneider sued the helmsleys yesterday , alleging that mrs helmsley was stripping helmsleyspear of its assets and essentially rendering it insolvent to avoid paying the partners millions of dollars in the suit , filed in state supreme court , they allege that she fraudulently siphoned upward of 40 million out of helmsleyspear over the last five years this tableau , however , is not entirely about money the adversaries are millionaires many times over who have given away more money than is under dispute and it is not as if they need to squirrel away something for their old age mr schwartz turned 84 last week mr schneider is 76 mr helmsley is 87 his wife , 74 the quarrel is more about control and ego and ageold bonds of loyalty being unwound the fact that mr schwartz and mr schneider have waited years to seek legal solutions , associates of theirs said , is in part because they did n't want to tarnish harry helmsley s name but , as a close associate of theirs put it , recently they 've gotten kicked around too many times by her none of the parties would comment on the battle frederic yerman , the lawyer for the helmsleys , said the couple denied any wrongdoing far from in any way looting helmsleyspear , he said , the helmsleys have contributed much more to the company than they have received from it howard graff , the lawyer for mr schwartz , said that the partners took the action as a last resort they feel this is a regrettable conclusion to a lifetime partnership they forged with harry helmsley , he said since last july , mr schwartz and mr schneider have argued before an arbitrator that mrs helmsley owes each of them 57 million in back pay , dating to 1990 they were given 1 million raises in 1989 that they claim she has reneged on furthermore , they contend that she has engaged in machinations to roust them from the business deriding her in court papers as a pretender devoid of authority , they said she had changed the bylaws of helmsleyspear to , among other things , allow them to be fired for no reason , in violation of their employment contracts in addition , they contend that mrs helmsley , acting improperly in mr helmsley s stead , has eviscerated helmsleyspear by unnecessarily closing 15 of the firm s 20 branch offices , arbitrarily dismissing employees , refusing to pay competitive wages and eliminating such basics as business cards they maintain that mrs helmsley s actions have left helmsleyspear , once one of the city s dominant realty firms , in a tenuous state it is doubtful that mr helmsley is even aware of the brawl he suffers from memory lapse and the lingering effects of strokes and is said by associates to spend most of his time in paradise valley , ariz in an affidavit filed in the arbitration , mr schneider declared that mr helmsley is completely incapable of coherent conversation and does not recognize me the squabble does not bear on the ownership of any buildings although mr schneider , mr schwartz and mr helmsley jointly own dozens of commercial buildings but it could affect the management and leasing of dozens of important commercial properties the viability of helmsleyspear matters to mr schwartz and mr schneider , since mr helmsley granted them an option in 1970 to buy the firm at a bargain price upon his death if they choose not to , they would receive a cash payment estimated at about 10 million apiece in 1977 , they were also granted employment contracts for life in essence , they contend that mrs helmsley has schemed to render helmsleyspear worthless , so that it would be not only not worth buying , but incapable of paying them the 20 million to others in real estate , the battle is somewhat bizarre i have no idea what s going on , said arthur lerner , a former senior executive at helmsleyspear somebody must be nuts i do n't know where this is stemming from in yesterday s suit , mr schneider and mr schwartz allege that through an array of fraudulent maneuvers , mrs helmsley has gutted helmsleyspear among other things , these are the contentions of the suit mrs helmsley paid herself and her husband salaries exceeding 13 million , despite their being virtually uninvolved in helmsleyspear s operations she charged personal expenses to helmsleyspear , including more than 1 million for an airplane since 1992 , she systematically shifted millions of dollars from helmsleyspear into helmsley enterprises , the parent company that owns the helmsley properties , including its hotels she then arranged for helmsley enterprises to lend money back to helmsleyspear and charge it interest that interest now exceeds 1 million a year she had helmsleyspear pay salaries and expenses of helmsley enterprises personnel she transferred the management of 17 properties from helmsleyspear to a firm she controls , helmsleynoyes such is the fragile state of the firm that commissions of 234 , 000 due in march to mr schneider and mr schwartz were not paid the suit asks that the assets be returned to helmsleyspear and that 100 million in punitive damages be paid to the two men as a building management and leasing company , helmsleyspear was once a formidable power in new york , but it has faded as a competitive force in recent years its portfolio , however , is still significant according to relocate , a real estate data service , it manages about 28 million square feet in 107 buildings in new york it employs 300 people harry helmsley began as a 12aweek office boy in a real estate brokerage and by the mid1940 s had his own company starting by buying decrepit buildings , he eventually erected an empire that at its zenith was valued at 5 billion mr schwartz worked briefly for mr helmsley , then left to join the spear company in 1955 , mr helmsley bought the spear company , creating helmsleyspear , in large part because he wanted mr schwartz working for him again mr schneider joined mr helmsley s company about 50 years ago quickly , the three of them became its guiding lights mr helmsley focused largely on arranging the financing of deals , while mr schwartz and mr schneider managed properties and helped scout for investments his two associates display contrasting styles mr schwartz is quiet and gentlemanly , while mr schneider is more intense and depicted as a tenacious bargainer in 1966 , mr schwartz and mr schneider were made executive vice presidents of helmsleyspear , reporting only to mr helmsley mr helmsley also gave each of them a small ownership stake in the firm , making them the only stockholders beside himself photo leona helmsley faces attacks over control of her husband sempire \( photoreporters , 1992 \)
pervomayskoye , russia , monday , jan 15 russian helicopter gunships and artillery launched an allout attack on this tiny border village just before 9 am this morning \( 1 am monday eastern time \) as rebel chechen soldiers fought bitterly to stave them off the storming of the village came after a night of artillery bombardment here and in the neighboring secessionist republic of chechnya fighter jets dropped flares so bright that the night seemed like day led by special forces troops , thousands of russian soldiers assaulted the village after talks with the rebels to win release of their 100 hostages broke down the hostages had been seized on tuesday by chechens in a raid on a hospital in the nearby town of kizlyar the last deadlines set by the russians for the hostages' release passed on sunday morning , at which point moscow seemed to have only two choices free the chechens , or attack them the russian troops had been poised to attack for 24 hours at dawn on sunday , not long before the 10 am deadline , hundreds of special forces troops marched through the kneedeep mud on the road leading to the village , in the southern russian republic of dagestan they were followed by a column of tanks , a field hospital and dozens of helicopters that buzzed the village but the deadline passed in silence , and soon after the tanks turned around , the soldiers piled onto dilapidated tourist buses and the helicopters landed there has been a decision to extend the deadline , aleksandr mikhailov , the spokesman for the russian federal security service , said on sunday we are ready to do what we have to do but we will talk until there is nothing left to talk about the hostage negotiations resumed briefly early today , but almost immediately , it seemed , there was nothing left to talk about indeed , mr mikhailov s boss , mikhail barsukov , who issued the ultimatum on saturday , had said even then there had been no more time to talk the russians know that storming the tiny hamlet will almost certainly insure the death of some , perhaps many , hostages but president boris n yeltsin , on the verge of announcing whether he will run for a second term in june , cannot afford to appear to appease the chechens , as was the case in budyonnovsk last year when guerrillas led by a chechen rebel commander named shamil basayev returned home as heroes after causing the death of more than 100 people in russia s worst terrorist incident on saturday the army increased its psychological attacks all night long , jets flew above the village , dropping bright orange flares in the morning , army troops set off flares and smoke bombs but none of this weakened the guerrillas' resolve the raid on the hospital in kizlyar was led by salman raduyev he is a close relative of the chechen secessionist leader dzhokhar m dudayev , and has made it clear that he will not lay down his many arms , as the russians have insisted the russians had said they had no intention of letting him walk out of the village and cross to chechnya , a mostly muslim republic only a few miles away the chechens have already promised more such actions the russian troops were also obviously ready to move in as the standoff stretched out , a senior officer of the interior ministry troops who encircled the village said this is a crime , and the criminal is boris n yeltsin he should let us do our job every minute that he delays we look weak , like fools he is a coward this sentiment is widely shared here among soldiers who have been deployed in the biting cold 13 months after 40 , 000 russian troops were sent to the region to confront chechen efforts to secede from the russian federation in moscow on sunday , mr yeltsin dispatched interior minister anatoly kulikov and mr barsukov to take over the operation here mr barsukov said on saturday that if the rebels released the hostages and gave up their weapons , they would be guaranteed safe passage back to their mountainous north caucasus homeland asked on sunday whether it was true the rebels could count on leaving unharmed if they fulfilled their end of the promise , mr mikhailov said , that s their problem more than 20 people were killed at the start of the crisis , when the rebels stormed kizlyar and took over a hospital there they tried to flee back to chechnya on wednesday but were blocked in pervomayskoye , just short of the border on sunday , the unpaved roads near the terek river were filled with school buses waving the green flag of islamic brotherhood i am a chechen and i have seen enough blood , said akhmed yakabulev , 85 , a refugee from the yearold war we can not go on any longer like this map of russia showing location of pervomayskoye
usually reduced to marginal , feelgood campaign homilies , education issues this year have emerged as a major focus in presidential politics to a degree unmatched in any presidential election in memory but despite widespread unease about the state of american education , indications are that president clinton is succeeding in getting across a relatively mainstream agenda of incremental change and expanded investment in education while his republican challenger , bob dole , is struggling to win support for a more farreaching agenda of fundamental change conservatives say mr dole s agenda of promoting school choice , cutting ineffective federal spending and bureaucracy and curbing the power of teachers' unions represents exactly the kind of radical innovations needed to invigorate the nation s schools but political and educational experts and poll results indicate that mr clinton is benefiting from a simple , upbeat message of commitment and educational investment , while mr dole has failed , for the most part , to generate enthusiasm for a more complicated message of radical educational change a poll of 996 likely voters released on oct 4 by louis harris and associates found that 63 percent of the respondents said mr clinton would do a better job on education and that 32 percent said mr dole would of 10 issues discussed in the poll , only the environment showed a higher gap between the approval rate of the two candidates , 65 percent for mr clinton and 27 percent for mr dole some experts say the gap may reflect the overall differences between the candidates as much as the issues specific to education but even conservatives concede that they also reflect the difficulty of communicating a new education agenda in the midst of a presidential campaign merle black , a professor of government at emory university , used a chemistry analogy to describe the issue education is what i call a valence issue there s only one charge who s opposed to education \? clinton s positioned himself as the guy who s for education and his opponents as the guys who always want to cut it it takes a long , complicated argument to spell out the alternative , and dole has n't made it from mr dole s stinging attacks on teachers' unions in his acceptance speech in san diego to mr clinton s use of education as a centerpiece in his oftrepeated promise to build a bridge to the 21st century , both candidates have given unusual prominence to educational issues in their first presidential debate , mr clinton used the words education and school 43 times bob dole used them 30 times the prominence reflects the widespread worries about the quality of the nation s schools , fears about the affordability of higher education and numerous studies showing education at or near the top of listings of issues of national concern typical was a gallup cnn usa today poll earlier this year that found education the top concern of voters as someone who cares deeply about education , i was very pleased that in the first presidential debate , you had president clinton saying education is the most important subject to him and senator dole talking more passionately about education than any other subject , said former gov lamar alexander of tennessee , who is also a former education secretary and republican presidential aspirant that has to be a first for a presidential race the candidates offer sharply different visions on educational issues the centerpiece of mr dole s program is a 25 billion program for what he calls opportunity scholarships , which would give eligible families up to 1 , 500 per child for private school tuition the scholarships would be aimed at low and middleincome families up to 4 million children or 10 percent of all school children with eligibility to be decided by the individual states mr dole says he wants to abolish the department of education , a republican campaign issue going back to president ronald reagan , and has made sharp attacks on teachers' unions as enemies of educational innovation mr clinton has offered a blizzard of initiatives a 2 billion , fiveyear technology program to link every classroom to the information superhighway hope scholarships that would provide 1 , 500 tax credits to help pay for the first two years of college a 5 billion federal program , the first of its kind , to build and repair schools , and restructuring student loans to allow more flexible repayment plans he has called for his own version of school choice in the form of publicly supported , largely autonomous charter schools rather than vouchers for private schools and he used his bully pulpit to argue for higher standards , school uniforms and programs to insure that every student reads by the third grade republicans and advocates of programs designed to give more options outside existing public schools say mr dole s proposal represents the kind of fundamental change sought by disgruntled parents and voters , particularly those whose children are trapped in failing urban schools indeed , they say mr dole s fullbore embrace of public vouchers to allow students to attend private schools reflects growing support for this kind of change
what began as a small fire in a dormitory oven and turned into a series of 18 more fires in one week on the campus of florida state university in tallahassee ended yesterday in the arrest of a freshman the student , jeffrey t knowles , 19 , of fort pierce , fla , was being held without bond in the leon county jail awaiting arraignment on arson , fraud and theft charges the police said mr knowles had admitted setting all but one of the fires , none of which resulted in injury or great property damage but the fires had brought a sense of unease to the campus of about 30 , 000 students many professors had been worried about fires destroying research or causing injury it s been a real problem , said ray jeffery , a criminology professor carey drayton , the campus police chief , said , florida state has experienced arson before , but not to this degree , ever the first fire , in which papers were burned inside an oven , was set on jan 30 , chief drayton said the fire was extinguished quickly and caused very little damage by friday , the arsonist had graduated from trash cans , bulletin boards and a mounted map of the world to the university s main library a small blaze set in the stacks ignited the covers of 48 bound magazines and journals , but was doused before it could spread , chief drayton said it is possible the arsonist did n't intend for the fires to go too far , the chief said , adding , but all of them had the potential to be a lot worse renee blosser , 20 , a senior biology major , told the associated press it was a real inconvenience for everybody because classes were being interrupted , rehearsals were being interrupted it s just stupid the last fire , set in a campus post office box on sunday evening , nearly spread throughout the interior of the post office , chief drayton said mr knowles was linked to the fires after lawenforcement investigators found fingerprints matching his at the scene of two blazes , chief drayton said mr knowles s fingerprints were on file because of his arrest last year by the tallahassee police on a forgery charge he was given six months probation , which he completed in december , said warren goodwin , an assistant state attorney mr knowles is to be arraigned this week on 18 counts of arson as well as theft the arson charges alone carry a maximum penalty of 540 years in prison the police say mr knowles stole 20 to 30 credit cards from the campus post office last october the police say they believe that mr knowles used the cards to purchase merchandise and to withdraw money from automated teller machines mr knowles has admitted to some of the post office breakins , chief drayton said
few people have seen john c malone recently but it seems that everybody is wondering what s on his mind with the federal trade commission threatening to block the merger of time warner inc and turner broadcasting system inc , mr malone and his cable company , telecommunications inc , are once again the center of attention yet mr malone has been silent on the subject indeed , he has been conspicuously absent from several recent highprofile industry events , including the national cable conference in los angeles last week and his low visibility has whipped up more gossip than usual among malonewatchers about how the chief executive of telecommunications might respond to the concerns of government regulators a spokesman for telecommunications said yesterday that mr malone had taken several weeks off to recuperate from the flu , and had returned to work on monday but mr malone declined to comment yesterday on the ftc s concerns telecommunications says it supports the merger of time warner and turner and hopes it will pass muster with staff members of the ftc , who have told the companies they will try to block the merger unless the deal s structure is modified but to ease ftc concerns about the deal s antitrust implications , people close to the discussions said , tci might have to accept a diminished role as the deal is now structured , telecommunications would swap its 23 percent interest in turner which it holds through its sister company , the liberty media corporation for a 9 percent stake in time warner people familiar with the talks said that the ftc was likely to object to such a direct link between the nation s two largest cable operators these people said the agency could demand that telecommunications accept nonvoting stock in time warner or that mr malone spin off what would become his personal stake in time warner to other liberty media shareholders given the hard bargain that mr malone drove in the original deal , some mediaindustry experts question whether telecommunications would make such concessions yet several analysts say mr malone has more reason to close the deal now than when it was announced in september this is not the only option for tci , said tom wolzien , an analyst at sanford c bernstein company , but there are a lot of reasons that this works for them telecommunications stock has languished since time warner said it would acquire turner for 75 billion in part because investors are chary about the company s prospects as it faces new competition from telephone companies and satellite broadcasters by swapping its stake in turner for an interest in time warner , analysts said , telecommunications would have a better chance to exert influence on the future of the industry despite its expansion into cable programming with liberty media , tci remains primarily a cable operator subject to the vagaries of that business time warner , by contrast , owns a wealth of assets in cable programming , movies , music and publishing telecommunications has already agreed to place its time warner shares in a voting trust to be controlled by that company s chairman , gerald m levin but people close to telecommunications note that if tci were to spin off liberty media , the power to vote the time warner shares would revert to liberty and hence to mr malone were the time warnerturner merger to collapse , analysts said , it could also make turner vulnerable to a bid from a company outside the cable business the general electric company , which owns nbc , and the news corporation have both expressed interest in turner , which owns valuable cable networks like cnn , tbc , tnt and the cartoon network according to the bylaws of turner , time warner and telecommunications , which were both shareholders in it even before the merger deal was proposed , each have the right to match any offer for the company but analysts said that tci with its onerous debt load and daunting capital expenses might be illequipped to match an outside offer even if mr malone were to agree to sell telecommunications' stake in turner , his company could face huge capital gains taxes indeed , the tax consequences of the time warner deal are one of its most alluring features , analysts said because tci is simply swapping its turner stake for an interest in time warner , the company would not have to pay any capital gains taxes the deal values turner at a multiple of 14 times operating cash flow , far more than telecommunications' original investment moreover , time warner s shares are now trading at only nine times operating cash flow as such , telecommunications would reap even greater returns if time warner s stock price rises you 're trading an expensive asset for an inexpensive asset without paying taxes , said john tinker , an analyst at montgomery securities of course , as mr tinker and other analysts noted , none of this means that mr malone will fall into line three years ago , tci agreed to support qvc inc when the homeshopping channel s chairman , barry diller , tried to take over paramount communications but midway through that takeover battle , mr malone retreated to his summer house in maine , where he struck a separate deal to sell telecommunications to the bell atlantic corporation for 214 billion that mammoth and unexpected merger threw mr diller s plans into turmoil and prompted a wave of concern on the part of federal regulators paramount subsequently went to viacom the tcibell atlantic deal also later collapsed as a result of disagreements over price at last week s cable conference , executives joked nervously that mr malone had skipped the show because he must have been negotiating a blockbuster deal with att or mci communications but mr malone s mind was on less weighty matters , people close to the company said yesterday in addition to the time he spent recuperating , they said , mr malone also launched the sailboat he keeps anchored off his vacation home in maine diagram a question of control shows the ownership structure of theparties involved in the pending merger of time warnerturner broadcasting system \( pg d7 \)
phoenix , feb 27 further complicating an already muddled republican presidential competition , steve forbes claimed victory in the arizona primary today , while senator bob dole prevailed in primaries in north dakota and south dakota the primary here was the biggest electoral prize thus far , with 39 delegates at stake , and by beating out patrick j buchanan and mr dole , mr forbes sought to establish himself as a formidable contender for his party s nomination mr dole s pair of victories was overshadowed by the verdict in arizona , which is likely to rekindle criticism that he lacks the broad appeal and the organizational ability to forge for himself an easy path to the republican nomination but the outcome was an important boost for mr forbes , the publishing heir who pumped millions of dollars of advertising money into his candidacy , only to see his fortunes rise and then fall in iowa and in the new hampshire primary he placed fourth in both contests now , mr forbes is on something of a roll , having won the delaware primary on saturday a week ago , they wrote our obituary , mr forbes said at a hotel ballroom here as hundreds of cheering supporters repeatedly interrupted him with chants of forbes '96 , forbes '96 now , tonight , we can perhaps write the obituary of conventional political punditry in america he added arizona will show why america s best days are ahead the most significant result of the busiest day of balloting since the first votes were cast earlier this month is that the race is more scrambled than ever , with three candidates vying for the title of frontrunner mr dole won the iowa caucuses and north and south dakota mr forbes won arizona and delaware and mr buchanan , the conservative columnist , won the new hampshire primary and the louisiana caucuses asked at a press conference tonight in atlanta who the frontrunner was , mr buchanan replied boy , you 've got a good question there that s very hard to say in arizona , senator dole and mr buchanan , conceded defeat with about 75 percent of the precincts reporting , mr forbes had about 34 percent of the votes , while mr dole had 29 percent with mr buchanan close behind with about 28 percent lamar alexander , whose campaign had been bolstered by a strong showing in new hampshire , was failing to break into double figures in any of last night s contests in arizona , he trailed far behind with 7 percent of the vote and in north dakota , he trailed senator phil gramm , who had dropped out of the race but was still on the ballot on his way back to washington after campaigning in atlanta , mr dole blamed the heavy advertising by mr forbes for his loss in arizona forbes spent 4 million that s what happened , mr dole said we spent 860 , 000 we ca n't match that kind of spending you ought to report what s happening this guy s trying to buy the election his campaign manager , scott reed , sought to play down the arizona result , saying , we won two out of three but mr reed conceded that the senator probably should have campaigned more in the state he made only a brief visit here and did not attend a debate last week mr reed also blamed the campaign s pollster , who was dismissed earlier this week , for giving him overly optimistic polling that as recently as monday put mr dole well ahead in arizona their finishes here only bolstered the resolve of mr buchanan and mr forbes to stay in the race , making it still more difficult for mr dole to consolidate his support but as the race turns to the south and the candidates enter a frenzied period of 34 more contests by the end of the month , mr dole s loss here puts even more pressure on him to demonstrate that he can win a major state the stakes for him will be particularly high in the south carolina primary on saturday , where he has the backing of most elected officials and even his closest aides say a loss would be devastating mr dole raised the stakes there himself today by predicting that he would win mr buchanan , looking clearly disappointed that he lost his aggressive bid in arizona , had said earlier that if he won the state he would be unstopable tonight , he said , clearly , it s going to be a much longer , drawnout battle mr dole had entered the races in both of the dakotas as the prohibitive favorite because of strong support among farmers and agricultural interests they were the senator s first victories in statewide primaries with 98 percent of the north dakota precincts reporting , mr dole had 42 percent of the vote , or more than twice as many votes as his closest rival the race for second place was too close to call , with mr forbes and mr buchanan each taking about a fifth of the votes mr alexander had six percent in south dakota , with 100 percent of precincts reporting , mr dole had 45 percent of the votes , while mr buchanan had 29 percent , mr forbes 13 percent and mr alexander 9 percent in the votebymail contest in north dakota , more than half the ballots had been cast before the new hampshire primary , when mr buchanan s upset victory over mr dole gave the campaign of the former commentator a huge lift in south dakota , blizzards and fierce gales across much of the state were blamed for holding down turnout

trenton , sept 27 between them , robert g torricelli and richard a zimmer have successfully run for the house of representatives 10 times but for all their experience , both are learning some new lessons about campaigning in their senate race mr torricelli , a democrat , is almost wistful in describing his first run for a house seat , in 1982 my trademark was i had a pair of sneakers , he said we always did neighborhood tours and picnics i always tried to meet 1 , 000 people each saturday but in his bid this year for the seat now held by senator bill bradley , who is retiring , knocking on doors , marching in parades and attending community meetings just wo n't do it , mr torricelli said in a recent interview this is different it s much more difficult to have contact with people , the race is much nastier and the stakes are higher mr zimmer , a republican , could not agree more you simply ca n't meet enough people or shake enough hands , he said you 've got to reach people wholesale these two candidates , like many in new jersey and other states , are learning the hard lessons of seeking statewide office of the need to raise millions of dollars to pay for expensive advertising on television and radio stations of the consultants who stay in their ears , constantly reminding them to make their messages appeal to diverse groups of people , and of friends and family members stunned by the intense amount of negative advertising and allegations both mr zimmer and mr torricelli have also found that new jersey , while small in size compared with a new york or california , is home to nearly eight million people and has traffic congestion serious enough to compete with the worst in any state for two senate candidates trying to introduce themselves to voters who live far beyond the borders of their congressional districts , getting to scheduled campaign appearances can be a nightmare but the biggest lesson both have learned is that they must limit their appearances to the events that either raise money to buy television time , or , better yet , present an opportunity to be seen on the 6 o'clock evening news it is a different order of magnitude , mr zimmer said it is very difficult james mcqueeny , a democratic political analyst , backed up the candidates' assessments there are a couple of things that they quickly learn when they leave their congressional districts , he said suddenly , they find out how unbelievably diverse new jersey is then , he said , the candidate has to figure out how do you get a message out that is appealing to this diverse group \? at the moment , polls show the race divided three ways , with about a third of the voters favoring mr torricelli , a third backing mr zimmer and a third undecided both candidates are trying to capture those voters , many of whom live in parts of bergen , passaic , essex , union , middlesex and monmouth counties the shape of the garden state parkway in that area has inspired some political analysts to call it the fertile crescent if you follow the curve through there and you go 20 miles either side of that parkway , you have 85 percent of the total swing vote , mr mcqueeny said when they come out of their districts , they see this huge swing vote the way you have to appeal to those people is not the communion breakfast or the rotary club like you did in your congressional race you touch them by television lawrence weitzner , mr zimmer s chief campaign consultant , said that on occasion , he has had to remind his client to refrain from talking about a wide range of ideas and viewpoints during campaign appearances there are times when we have to say , 'you did a good job , but you have to stay more focused , ' mr weitzner said the only way your message can really crack through is by repeating it over and over and over and as much as you 'd like to talk about many issues that you have expertise on and ideas for the future , you have to limit it so that your message will crack through for mr zimmer , a 52yearold resident of delaware township , delivering his message has meant sticking with the daily activities that tend to portray him , as mr weitzner put it , as a fiscal conservative and social moderate who wants to cut taxes , cut spending and get tough on crime mr torricelli , 45 , from englewood , said he is bewildered by how difficult it is to get the news media s attention and reach voters by discussing a broad range of topics we 've tried to blend some of the traditional congressional campaign in , he said , by staging various events like announcements of endorsements from specialinterest groups but it s been marginally successful , he conceded mr torricelli said he had hoped to win support by discussing medicare , education , the environment and gun control but he said his attempts to discuss those topics have attracted little of the precious free television coverage that both candidates yearn for all in all , it s been different than i thought , and a lot of it has been frustrating , mr torricelli said what does seem to be attracting attention is the huge amount of negative television and radio advertising that is being broadcast either by the candidates or on their behalf when the race is over , each side is expected to have spent 8 million or more in what some experts are calling the most expensive and meanest senate battle of the political season although the candidates' families and friends have witnessed ugly campaigns before , none have been like this , both men said my dad is taking it very hard , mr zimmer said of his 83yearold stepfather and mr torricelli said he encourages his family members not to watch television i call my sister and say 'do n't take it seriously people who know us know better' as for getting around the state , ron sullivan , a spokesman for mr torricelli s campaign , said you figure you can drive anywhere but you end up spending your whole day in the car new jersey roads are densely populated it s deceptive everything seems so close mr zimmer , too , has been frustrated in his travel plans squeezed by the need to perform his legislative duties and to raise money , he recently chartered a plane to fly from washington to a fundraising event in new jersey the expense did not pay off , though , as bad weather left the congressman sitting on the runway at dulles international airport while the event went on without him chart comparison a more difficult task representatives robert g torricelli , from new jersey s ninth district , and richard a zimmer , from the 12th district , are campaigning for the senate seat of bill bradley , a democrat , who is retiring unlike their previous congressional compaigns , their senate compaigns will have to cover more ground and reach more people , and each man will have to spend more than both of them have spent on all of their congressional campaigns combined chart provides demographical information on new jersey s 9th and 12th districts , along with campaign spending figures for mr zimmer and mr torricelli \( sources the almanac of american politics 1996 congressional quarterly \) \( pg b5 \)
in an unusual move tantamount to approving a new drug , the food and drug administration plans to publish in the federal register a notice that says ordinary oral contraceptives can be safely and effectively used as morning after pills , according to a top agency official at a hearing on friday , the reproductive health advisory committee of the federal agency unanimously declared that birth control pills could be used to prevent pregnancy up to 72 hours after unprotected intercourse but because of concerns about not only liability litigation but also antiabortion protests , no manufacturer has been willing to market the pills specifically for such postcoital , or emergency , use and without an application from a manufacturer , the food and drug administration cannot formally approve the new use , said the official , mary pendergast , the deputy commissioner we 're trying to pave the way for greater access to emergency contraception , and this is as far as we can go without a new drug application , ms pendergast said in an interview yesterday we hope the notice in the federal register will calm people s anxieties about using oral contraceptives as morningafter pills and we 're still hopeful that someone will come forward to market them she added , once we 've declared that they 're safe and effective , the approval process for a manufacturer would be very simple , just a matter of making sure that what they 're selling is the bioequivalent of what we 've approved birth control pills have been used to prevent pregnancy postcoitally for more than a decade in countries including britain , new zealand , switzerland and france , where the pills are sold in special packages for such use and in the united states , college health specialists , rape crisis centers and some reproductive health clinics have increasingly offered oral contraceptives for postcoital use to women who were raped , whose method of birth control failed or who reported that they simply failed to use contraception in late 1994 , the center for reproductive law and policy , a new york advocacy group , petitioned the federal agency to require companies that sell birth control pills in this country to label them for use as a postcoital contraceptive for such use , the first dose of two or four pills , depending on the strength of the pill , must be taken within 72 hours of intercourse , and a second dose , the same size , must follow 12 hours later used properly , oral contraceptives have been found to prevent pregnancy postcoitally 75 percent of the time we told the fda that the pharmaceutical companies are providing misleading information when they fail to tell women that these pills can safely be used this way , said janet benshoof , the center s president , who filed the petition on behalf of clients including planned parenthood of new york , the american public health association and the american medical women s association this is not really an offlabel use , ms benshoof continued in an interview yesterday it s another contraceptive use at a different dosage but because it s birth control , and everyone is so worried about liability , some doctors have been hesitant to use it that way at rape crisis centers , though , it s become so much the standard of care that there was a malpractice case in california based on failure to offer emergency contraception to a rape victim besides the concerns about litigation , manufacturers and doctors are wary of becoming embroiled in abortion politics the agency considers morningafter pills a form of contraception since they block the fertilized egg from implanting into the uterine wall implantation , not fertilization , marks the beginning of pregnancy by the health community s definition but the roman catholic church and some other opponents of abortion believe that life begins when sperm and egg unite and therefore oppose postcoital contraception at the hearing on friday in washington , rebecca lindstadt of the american life league said postcoital contraception was killing an unborn child before its life is even begun the family research council , which also opposes postcoital use of the pill , said that if relabeling occurs , girls and women may forgo other forms of birth control and simply choose to consume larger doses of the pill after sex a spokeswoman for the conference of american catholic bishops has said in the past that although catholic hospitals can provide the pills for rape victims if a doctor suspects that conception has not

washington , june 26 the supreme court ruled today that under the skeptical scrutiny that applies to government action that treats men and women differently , the state of virginia cannot justify keeping women out of its statesupported military college , the virginia military institute women seeking and fit for a vmiquality education cannot be offered anything less under the state s obligation to afford them genuinely equal protection , justice ruth bader ginsburg said in a majority opinion for six justices a seventh member of the court , chief justice william h rehnquist , agreed in a separate opinion that the allmale admissions policy at the 157yearold military college violated the constitution and that the remedy accepted by the lower courts , a women s leadership program supported with state money at a nearby women s college , was inadequate the vote was therefore 7 to 1 on the basic constitutional holding in one of the court s most important sex discrimination cases in years the lone dissenter was justice antonin scalia , who objected that change is forced upon virginia , and reversion to singlesex education is prohibited nationwide , not by democratic processes but by order of this court justice clarence thomas , whose son attends vmi , did not take part in the case the opinion leaves the state with the theoretical option of turning the college into a private institution , which would be free to exclude women but officials at the school in lexington , va , indicated today that this option was probably not realistic whether or not it is feasible is very problematical , maj gen josiah bunting 3d , the superintendent of vmi , said at a news conference there this afternoon i must discourage speculation about that the board of trustees will meet july 12 and 13 and decide how to proceed , general bunting said a 1963 graduate of vmi , he described the ruling as a savage disappointment also at stake is the future of the virginia women s institute for leadership at mary baldwin college in staunton , va , where 42 students have just completed their first year of a program accepted by the lower courts as a valid alternative to admission to vmi justice ginsburg said that the women s program was only a pale shadow of what vmi offered to male students and that it provided none of the considerable benefits of a degree from vmi , long one of the most prestigious educational institutions in the south chief justice rehnquist called the women s program distinctly inferior general bunting said a foundation supported by vmi alumni would continue to provide financing for the mary baldwin program for four more years the country s only other state supported allmale college , the citadel in south carolina , will also be governed by the ruling today south carolina has also proposed a separate women s program at a private college , which is awaiting review in federal district court in charleston the case presented the court with two questions the first was whether the exclusion of women violated the equal protection guarantee of the 14th amendment , as the justice department charged when it sued the state of virginia in federal district court in roanoke in 1990 once the court found the allmale admissions policy to be unconstitutional , the second question was whether the alternative women s program was sufficient to remedy the violation the case had a complicated history in the lower courts , with the most recent ruling , a 1995 decision by the united states court of appeals for the fourth circuit , in richmond , answering yes to both questions the appeals court said that while the admissions policy deprived women of equal protection , the mary baldwin program was sufficiently comparable to a vmi education to solve the problem for women actually to enroll at vmi and take part in the rigorous militarystyle training there would destroy any sense of decency that still permeates the relationship between the sexes , the appeals court said in an opinion that emphasized the spartan nature of barracks life and the brutalities of the rat line in which older students scream at and harass firstyear cadets in her opinion today , justice ginsburg dismantled the appeals court s analysis in a manner both methodical and sweeping while it might be true that most women would neither choose nor benefit from the educational methods at vmi , that was beside the point , she said , noting that the state never declared that a vmi education was suitable for most men either generalizations about 'the way women are , ' estimates of what is appropriate for most women , no longer justify denying opportunity to women whose talent and capacity place them outside the average description , justice ginsburg said the state s alternative program affords no cure at all for the opportunities and advantages withheld from women who want a vmi education and can make the grade , she said justice ginsburg said virginia s concern , as endorsed by the appeals court , that it would be destructive to place men and women together at vmi reflected the same ancient and familiar fear that kept women out of law and other professions until well into modern times she said the fact that women had graduated at the top of their classes from each of the federal military academies and were serving successfully in the military indicated that virginia s fears for the future of vmi may not be solidly grounded

chicago , dec 29 the rumors started flying like bullets more than a year ago through austin , a neighborhood of poverty and pride on chicago s west side and they were ugly tales of the street , something out of one of those lifeinthehood movies that a grandmother like leola spann would never allow her grandchildren to go see so for a long time , as she worked closely with the police to help save her drugplagued neighborhood , mrs spann refused to believe the stories she kept hearing about crooked officers planting evidence on suspects , stealing money from drug dealers and behaving like gang members as they patrolled the streets i did n't want to believe anything like that , said mrs spann , the president of a neighborhood group it would hurt too bad but what federal prosecutors are saying in open court about seven of the officers from the area is worse than even some of the rumors nine days ago , the officers were arrested and charged , along with a civilian , with robbing and extorting tens of thousands of dollars from undercover federal agents posing as drug dealers according to court papers , one of the officers , edward lee jackson , is a highranking leader of one of chicago s oldest street gangs , the conservative vice lords , which traces its history of bloodshed and drugs back to the 1950 s in his police station locker , investigators found a photograph of officer jackson , who is 26 , flashing gang signs and posing with members of the vice lords , court papers say and the city s police department is now trying to determine , if he is a gang member , how he could have hidden that connection and gotten a badge and a gun from the city of chicago it does n't surprise me , said frank radke , a deputy police chief who oversees the west side we have gang members who are jail guards in several cities and institutions in illinois a lot of gang members do n't overtly express their gang connections mr jackson s lawyer , joan hill mcclain , said of the allegations of membership , that s ludicrous and it s an absolute lie ms mcclain said that mr jackson was a good officer and that numerous people from austin had contacted her in recent days to say they would come forward and speak on his behalf but in the last few years , according to the chicago suntimes , at least 15 officers , out of a force of more than 12 , 000 , have been tainted by suspected ties to street gangs , by being investigated , charged or forced to resign a few days after the arrests , the police superintendent , matt rodriguez , ordered department lawyers to draft a policy forbidding officers to associate with gang members experts say that policy , if it is found to be constitutional , will not be easy to enforce and , they say , it may be impractical , since part of an officer s job might be to cultivate sources in gangs in some chicago neighborhoods , belonging to a street gang is a key to survival for young men and boys most grow out of membership as they find jobs and have families others stay in for years , handing gang membership down to their children and to their children s children , especially in neighborhoods like austin where jobs disappeared long ago a lot of police officers grow up in the same kind of neighborhood still , the police and irving a spergel , a university of chicago professor who is an expert in street gangs , said there were few gang members in blue there s a long history of gangs involved in politics in chicago , mr spergel said but i think the police department in chicago is pretty clean the officers , now known as the austin seven , have all pleaded not guilty other than mr jackson , none have been accused of being gang members they were just hustlers and vultures with badges , said melvin delk , a neighborhood advocate who has close ties to local street gangs they are a menace to the community they only served and protected themselves the investigation that brought about the officers' arrests was begun after months of complaints from the community officer jackson , mr delk said , was known as pac man , because people said he planted packs of drugs on suspects there s enough legitimate crime out here , mr delk said , that the police do n't need to plant nothing on you he said some officers now under arrest did clean the corners of dealers and customers , but in the process they also took the crumpled 10 bills from the desperate addicts waiting to buy their next fix they 'd curse them , kick them in the butt , take their money , put it in their pocket and go buy some doughnuts , mr delk said then the dope fiend would have to go out and beg or rob somebody to get his money back , and the whole vicious cycle would keep on turning in austin , police officials met with neighborhood advocates and politicians on friday , and more than two dozen other meetings are scheduled in the next 30 days , including a mass rally on monday night we want to know how this could happen for so long and who is accountable , mrs spann said we 've been working too hard and too long to be betrayed like this it has been a heartbreaking week for mrs spann and many of her neighbors when no one else in chicago seemed to care if the children of austin lived or died , at least the police were always at their side as they did everything they could think of to turn the neighborhood around austin was one of the first neighborhoods in the city to participate in the community policing program , and crime in the neighborhood was down by more than 10 percent for the first 11 months of 1996 the neighbors went to court to close drug houses they planted gardens in vacant lots , opened afterschool programs and marched for peace through street gang war zones and they taught their children to respect and trust the police we 're going to have to teach them a different lesson now , mrs spann said we 're going to have to teach them that not all police officers are bad but for others in the neighborhood , like 66yearold louis trueluck , the austin seven are only the tip of the iceberg they missed at least three or four other dirty cops , mr trueluck said as he leaned on his walking cane when i see they 're in the neighborhood , i get in the house photo melvin delk , a chicago activist , said the officers arrested on extortion charges were a menace to his west side

the only thing missing was a marching band wedged instrument to instrument outside a cramped 14by18foot television studio were a rockandroll band , a classical ensemble , a folk singer and one guitarstrumming ariatoallmanbrothers television host i fit the brooklyn bridge in here once , the host , carl bruno , said not the span , but another music group that features a lead singer , johnny maestro , and eight members , including a horn section with trombones extended , that group tested the performerholding capacity of the small studio at tci cable in port jefferson , where mr bruno tapes his program none of the three cameras jammed against the back wall could shoot the entire bridge so we improvise , the director , terrence dollard , said in the music with carl bruno show , viewers see plenty of closeups , especially of mr bruno the show , which mr bruno created , produces and stars in , recently celebrated its 15th anniversary it is the longestrunning television variety show on long island , and one of the longest running in the nation that is probably because of the cable system that it runs on in the middle of an island dominated by cablevision systems of woodbury sits an oasis known as tci , formerly called brookhaven cable back in the 1980 s , when cablevision was trying to gobble up all the small cable companies on long island , there was one holdout , brookhaven for whatever reason tci refused to sell thus cablevision ca n't claim a monopoly , and tci can offer its 69 , 000 households a program like music with carl bruno , which seems like a cross between the ed sullivan show and captain kangaroo the childlike mr bruno , with his bowtie , bugs bunny suspenders and saddle shoes , draws viewers of all ages mainly because viewers have no idea what they will be seeing from show to show one week mr bruno can be dressed as an elf who is singing it s a small , small world the next he can be singing an aria , as he did for a show to be televised next month the only constant is music mr bruno loves music , all kinds of music besides musical guests , he opens and closes each program by singing a song when guests do n't show up , he sings some more he accompanies himself with a guitar and a prerecorded track that includes mr bruno as he plays all the instruments and sings the harmony talk about a oneman band as brookhaven s music man , mr bruno is an entire production he is n't paid for the program , which is shown five times a week on tci and twice a month on telicare , which can be seen on cablevision mr bruno performs for the joy of performing and there is much joy in watching him sing and chat with his guests as he offers pun after pun when interviewing jerry rizzi , a composer from hicksville , he asked about impressionistic music the impression i get , mr bruno said with a smile toward the camera after singing an aria , he told his audience that s the first time i 've done a classical piece on the show that s because my bach has been giving me trouble but i 've got a handel on it then he turned to his stereo equipment , pushed a button and the recorded music started up again as mr bruno strummed the guitar in a world of high tech and computergenerated everything , the bruno program is live television the way it used to be , back in the days when betty furness could n't open the refrigerator door it is a touch of americana on an island of sophistication for 15 years the only thing that has changed is the look of the host mr bruno started the show when he was 25 he recently turned 40 the hair is thinner and grayer now and he is much thinner , having survived a poisoning incident with ltrytophan back in the late 80 s even when he was deathly ill from a tainted supply , he kept his program going although the director at the time said , 'you 'd better say something about why you look so bad , ' he recalled remnants of the illness are still evident but with smiling eyes that draw you in , and shy childlike hand movements reminiscent of a tiny tim or peewee herman , mr bruno is quite endearing he s very spiritual and at the same time very flamboyant , mr rizzi said most of all he is very sincere mr bruno did not set out to be a television star a friend of mine was doing carpentry work at tci , he recalled he told me they needed someone to do a music show i thought , 'why not me \? ' they auditioned us live on the air i won that was in 1980 mr bruno , a graduate of center moriches high school , was performing with a local band back then i always played music , he said i always wanted to be an entertainer i played the sax in a house band but then he decided to become a oneman band i built a recording studio in my home , he said i multitracked me playing my instruments i play keyboard , percussion and horns mr bruno uses those tapes to accompany himself i do private parties , he said , weddings , nursing homes i'm a live act he is also devoutly religious when asked how he would characterize himself , he said i guess i'm a cross between st francis and red skelton when not performing for groups , he is taping his program on the first show he told his audience , i do n't know what age you are , so i 'll do all kinds of songs
as one who reached maturity in the great depression , i remember well the accomplishments of the wpa and feel strongly that something of that nature is what we need today as a young newspaper reporter , i can recall asking a wpa administrator about the wastefulness of some of its projects \( for example , dozens of men with snow shovels laboring or , as some critics complained , merely leaning on their shovels to complete a job that could have been accomplished by one man with power equipment in about the same time \) his answer was we 're not trying to do the most efficient job we 're trying to create jobs where none now exist rather than collecting welfare checks , workers had the satisfaction of feeling that they had earned the income they received and it was not only manual laborers who found work under this program the wpa recognized that artists and writers , actors and playwrights also had to buy groceries less widely known were the activities of the civilian conservation corps its work was largely in forestry , national parks etc with the importance of conservation today , this program , too , might be revived richard m hemenway block island , ri
a person whose erratic behavior includes episodes of misconduct and colossally poor judgment does not belong on the bench yet the new york state commission on judicial conduct chose merely to censure state supreme court justice lorraine miller , despite a string of bizarre actions that fully justified tossing her out of her job judge miller s behavior fueled by jealousy and a desire for revenge was inexcusable the commission found she had sent approximately 60 anonymous and harassing , annoying and offensive mailings to various newspapers , businesses and individuals , about her former boyfriend , a fellow judge , and his new wife some mailings included sensitive information about the wife s previous marriages lifted from confidential court papers the commission also cited an unrelated but no less troubling courtroom episode in 1992 when judge miller took a note from deliberating jurors and did not tell the defendant , who had a right to be informed about the note and what was in it before accepting a plea bargain before the verdict the commission described her misconduct as serious and extensive , and acknowledged that judges must be held to high standards on and off the bench yet it chose to let her retain her position of trust , arguing that none of what had happened had undermined her effectiveness as a judge but her abuse of sealed court documents alone should be disqualifying moreover , had anyone pressed charges , the judge s harassment could well have resulted in a criminal proceeding against her the commission seemed further mollified by the fact that the judge had expressed regret about her conduct but nobody else found her particularly contrite indeed , she flatly denied the charges to reporters , saying the only reason she accepted the commission s statement of facts was her desire to put the matter behind her the commission is struggling to do its job under severe budget constraints but that is no reason for its lenient treatment of a flawed judge and its lamentable failure to carry out its mission of policing judicial misconduct

the boss , whipsmart and selfassured , had risen like a comet to become chief executive of a bluechip entertainment company in his early 40 s on the way up , however , he had acquired certain blind spots he was an armchair quarterback , signing off on every small decision his meetings were a disaster people wandered in every few minutes , with the boss doing nothing to fend off distractions key vice presidents were on the verge of mass resignation the directors got wind of the crisis a call went out to howard j morgan , a human resources consultant who calls himself an executive coach a mr fixit for personal dysfunction in the executive suite for five days late last year , mr morgan attached himself like a barnacle to the manhattanbased executive , sitting through his meetings , eavesdropping on his phone calls , tagging along on business lunches at the union square cafe he came up with practical advice and kept shadowing the executive to make sure he followed through was time management a problem \? very well , mr morgan became the boss s gatekeeper when subordinates knocked on the door , he told them , politely but firmly , to take a hike if the boss was hurrying to a meeting and stopped to chat , mr morgan demanded , could n't that have waited \? after the initial fullcourt press , mr morgan tapered off his contacts he expects the executive , who insisted on anonymity , to remain under his care for a year , at a cost to his company of about 40 , 000 usually the person hates me for the first three months , said mr morgan , who usually coaches several top executives at once , including clients at american express and cocacola but by the fourth month they 'll love me in a tactful way you 're holding them up on things no one s tackled them on before companies in trouble have long looked to outside experts for advice on market strategy , quality control and other straightahead business topics but sometimes the problems turn out to be interpersonal , and then an executive coach may be called to the rescue with backgrounds ranging from actual former football coaches to psychologists and personnel from downsized human resources departments , executive coaches promise to rehabilitate talented bosses with whom , because of gaps in their personality , no one wants to work tom saporito , a senior vice president of rhr international , a coaching firm based in chicago , described some reasons coaches are hired there s a fire burning , a crisis of confidence , a tremendous rift in the management team , a ceo suddenly out there by his lonesome without the support of the organization the small but growing practice has been embraced by companies like texaco , att , citibank and sun microsystems there is no single reason for the rise of coaching over the last decade but one factor appears to be the gutting of legions of middle managers , which has meant that surviving bosses have authority over areas where they have no expertise , straining their people skills also , the advent of a generation of workers under age 45 who are more diverse racially and sexually and were brought up to question authority , has undermined the effectiveness of older white male bosses , many of whom adhere to commandandcontrol management years ago , if you were good , you could get away with being abrasive , said judith blanton , a coach with rhr nowadays people do n't want to work with you yet another factor is the spread of managed health care , which has squeezed the incomes of psychotherapists and prompted many to branch out a special issue of the journal of consulting psychology , to be published next month , extols coaching as a career of the future there is even coach university on the internet , a school for wouldbe coaches who attend classes by conference call and download course work from the world wide web \( http www coachu com info htm \) enrollment has more than tripled in the last year , to nearly 400 many students , who pay a fee of 2 , 495 , already have coaching clients , said thomas j leonard , the former financial planner in salt lake city who founded coach u longtime coaches warn that newcomers to the field , which is unlicensed and unregulated , may be inexperienced and dangerously naive about corporate realities it s a fad now , but unless you understand the culture of a company , you can give people some bad advice , said dr blanton , a consulting psychologist a clinical psychologist who tells someone to share their feelings can end up getting that person fired coaches tend to work in boutique practices , though some big consulting firms have entered the field fees range from 5 , 000 for a halfdozen 90minute sessions to 100 , 000 for consultations that can last two years and involve factfinding interviews by the coach with dozens of colleagues , customers , even families almost all coaches deny they engage in psychotherapy successful executives , they say , will not tolerate being sent to a work shrink but one new york manager who received coaching and who has spent time in psychotherapy said the line was not clearcut it s therapy disguised under the word 'coaching , ' which is brilliant , she said , because these people have opened up a whole area for themselves
if you read between the lines of the recent stories in the washington post , new york times and arab media about who was behind the june 25 bombing of us troops in saudi arabia , two intriguing facts stand out fact 1 is that saudi arabia is accusing iran and proiranian saudi shiites of masterminding the bombings , which killed 19 americans and injured hundreds more fact 2 is that saudi arabia is letting it be known that syria may have been involved in this bombing , because a key witness committed suicide while in syrian custody before he could testify now for saudi arabia , a notoriously cautious nation , to let these incendiary facts out on the eve of the us elections is very interesting what s going on \? here are a few possible explanations 1 the saudis fear that after the election the us is going to open a dialogue with iran , because the us has concluded it cannot deal with iraq , afghanistan or the gulf without a better relationship with teheran two weeks ago the assistant secretary of state for the near east , robert pelletreau , gave a speech in dubai that was interpreted in the gulf mr pelletreau insists wrongly as signaling a greater us willingness for a new relationship with iran did the saudis see those remarks and decide to finger the iranians now for the dhahran bombing to undercut any possible shift in us policy \? 2 the saudis have let it be known that jaafar almarzuk chueikhat , a saudi shiite member of the proiranian underground in eastern saudi arabia , was alleged by several of those arrested for the dhahran bombing to be a key figure in delivering the explosives saudi intelligence , with the help of other arab secret services , reportedly tracked mr chueikhat s movements and found that he had gone back and forth between lebanon s bekaa valley , damascus and saudi arabia several times before the bombing , and while in damascus may have had contacts with the iranian embassy the saudis asked the syrians to arrest him the syrians balked at first but finally picked him up at the yarmouk palestinian refugee camp in damascus , a stronghold of the proiranian islamic jihad group the syrians threw him into mazze prison on sept 18 a saudi delegation arrived in damascus to interrogate mr chueikhat that is when they were told that unfortunately he had committed suicide in his cell the night before the saudis assumed it was a kevorkianstyle assisted suicide to cover up syria s involvement or as they used to say in the mafia the poor guy shot himself in the head four times the saudis asked to see the body the syrians said unfortunately he was already buried and he did n't leave a note the saudis demanded an explanation from the syrians they got none one reason this story is coming out now could be related to the power struggle inside saudi arabia for succession to ailing king fahd crown prince abdullah , the heir apparent , is known for his close ties to syria this story is very embarrassing for him , and therefore may be helpful to his opponents another reason it is coming out now may be that the saudis are tired of being intimidated by the syrians and do n't mind creating a climate in which the syrians are viewed as outlaws so the new hardline israeli government can slap them around with impunity 3 a third theory is that the saudis are just nervous , and people who are nervous do funny things the saudis have never had much confidence in the clinton foreignpolicy team all of america s allies in the middle east bahrain , saudi arabia , turkey , kuwait , jordan are weaker and more vulnerable today than they were when the gulf war ended in 1991 , while their enemies , iran and iraq , are either stronger or holding their own were the saudis blaming iran in order to warm up ties with iraq \? or had the saudis decided that they did not want the fbi poking around their kingdom any longer and therefore they would blame iran , execute those already arrested and then close the case before it turned up anything embarrassing about homegrown saudi unrest \? 4 maybe things are just as they appear maybe iran and its agents really did blow up the dhahran barracks and maybe jaafar chueikhat got a pistachio stuck in his throat and did choke to death in a syrian prison before he could tell his story maybe and maybe not

washington square park once offered , in henry james s words , a kind of established repose which is not of frequent occurrence in other quarters of the long , shrill city in recent decades , villagers and tourists seeking the park s repose have been just as likely to be greeted with a steady chorus of smoke , smoke and sense , sense , from drug dealers hawking marijuana and sensimilla , a potent strain of the drug lately , though , the heat has been on , and not just the drug dealers are unhappy some residents are concerned that as the police arrest more dealers and users within the park , drug activity will filter over to the streets and sidewalks near their homes it s great that they are cracking down on washington square park , but this really affects all the streets in the adjacent community , said louanne bulik , the president of the new west fourth street block association to only target the park does n't really solve the problem they need to expand the focus ms bulik said that on a recent friday night , she counted a dozen dealers on her block , between the avenue of the americas and macdougal street arrests in washington square park nearly doubled last year , to 945 , almost all drugrelated there was a similar increase in the number of summonses for marijuana possession , to 775 last year from 399 in 1994 the crackdown on drug dealing in the park is part of the police department s continuing quality of life campaign , which concentrates on lowlevel street crimes on the theory that doing so will stem larger crimes we 're interfering with their business , capt peter cassidy , the commander of the sixth precinct , said at a recent meeting of the precinct s community council hopefully we 'll spread them out to the point that they 'll have to go but ms bulik and other residents worry about where the dealers are spreading to i have seen a marked resurgence of drug dealing on west fourth street , she told the council meeting captain cassidy assured her that the police would continue applying pressure to dealers wherever they try to sell past crackdowns in the park have had little effect many lowlevel dealers still get very light sentences often the time served between their arrest and their trial and return quickly on thursday night , as a police patrol car cruised the east end of the park and an officer on foot watched the southwest , a young man approached a dealer standing in front of the arch we 've got to go to sixth avenue , the dealer told him there s too many cops here roger cox , the block association vice president , who has lived on west fourth street for more than 20 years , makes a habit of trying to disrupt drug deals by summoning nearby police officers or , when none are around , by yelling yo ! do n't deal on this block ! sometimes , he said , he is threatened for his efforts it has been a chronic dilemma for us , mr cox said every attempt to reduce the drug trafficking in the park simply spills over onto the surrounding streets if i have a choice of dealing with drug dealers in the park and drug dealers on my stoop , i 'd rather see them in the park , quite frankly michael cooper
the rangers , who have passed the first step in their quest for this year s stanley cup , are still paying for the stanley cup they won two years ago george nicolau , the national hockey league s impartial arbitrator , has ruled that the rangers owe four players from their 1994 championship nearly 250 , 000 in playoff bonuses nicolau also ruled that they owe one of those four and a fifth player bonus money for last year s playoff , bringing to 277 , 850 the combined playoff bonuses the rangers presumably had hoped they would n't have to pay the arbitrator issued his ruling last friday in an 18page opinion , a copy of which was obtained by the new york times yesterday the decision came in a case in which the league and the club , believed to be acting at the league s urging , contended that the rangers did n't have to pay the bonuses because they were negotiated with other clubs before the rangers acquired the players in trades the case , which nicolau heard last january , was not a complete loss for the nhl the arbitrator also ruled that clubs hereafter do not have to pay qualifying for the playoffs bonuses to players they get in trades unless they agree at the time of the trades to pay the bonuses the bonuses teams do have to pay , nicolau ruled , are those that players negotiate for winning or advancing to particular playoff rounds the league , citing an earlier nicolau decision in another bonus matter , argued that the bonuses do not travel with traded players but the nhl players association countered that the previous case was not relevant to the ranger bonuses in question in his decision , nicolau noted that neil smith , the rangers' president and general manager , readily agreed that the very purpose of obtaining players at or close to the trading deadline is to achieve success in those future contests nicolau ordered the rangers to pay nick kypreos 112 , 850 , glenn anderson 40 , 000 and craig mactavish 25 , 000 for their stanley cup contributions he also said esa tikkanen was entitled to the 100 , 000 the rangers had paid him under protest for the 1994 playoffs , though he has to return 40 , 000 the club initially had paid him under its own bonus plan in addition , the rangers must pay kypreos and petr nedved 20 , 000 each for last year s playoffs none of the the five players are still with the rangers smith did not return a telephone call seeking comment on the ruling
of all the relationships that hollywood has carried on with the real world , none has been thornier than its lovehate relationship with the weather climatic unpredictability has undoubtedly caused hollywood more headaches than the hissy fits of a thousand petulant movie stars think of the millions of dollars that melted away when the cast and crew of apocalypse now had to sit around in the philippines because their set had been blown away by a typhoon but as much as hollywood ca n't control the weather , it needs dramatic moodenhancing weather the way a star s face requires good lighting hollywood has always known that tears are sadder when accompanied by a sympathetic rainstorm \( and groaningly tragic music on the soundtrack \) right now , hollywood is in its love phase with meteorology , the ultimate weather movie , twister , having grossed 95 million in its first 10 days in theaters but it should come as no surprise that the havocwreaking funnel clouds in twister behave according to the laws of hollywood , not those of nature twister is supposed to be about brave , stormobsessed scientists \( bill paxton and helen hunt \) who chase tornadoes the better to understand them and predict their paths but , this being hollywood , it is the tornadoes who chase the scientists like avenging demons every time i watch a hollywood film crassly humanize the weather to make it express the moods of its characters , i cringe a little as an amateur meteorologist who grew up subscribing to weather journals like the monthly weather review , kept a record of barometricpressure readings and even had a windspeed indicator installed in the attic of the house in which i grew up , i was aware by the age of 12 that most movie storms were as fake as the plastic monsters in the beast from 20 , 000 fathoms special effects could not conceal the obvious that stormtossed ships were puny little toys , buffeted by electric fans and illuminated by lightning machines a weather channel addict , i feel a tiny jolt of excitement today whenever i see those orange doppler radar blips advancing across the screen , signaling severe thunderstorms to my eye , the computergenerated tornadoes that spiral from the heavens and rake the oklahoma landscape in twister are only slightly more realistic than the granddaddy of all movie tornadoes , the twister in the wizard of oz that scooped dorothy and her dog , toto , out of the grim kansas landscape and deposited them in a storybook kingdom that tornado , which caused the film makers no end of trouble to design , was created with a 50foot muslin stocking for all the technological ingenuity that went into them , the tornadoes in twister look like crude and surprisingly tame approximations of the real thing in presenting them , this movie , which fancies itself so weathersensitive , includes many glaring gaffes in an early scene in which scientists prepare for the chase , the cloud formations in the background vary so much from shot to shot it s obvious that a scene occupying 20 minutes of real time took days to complete one moment the sky is nearly clear , the next mostly cloudy , then back to clear the whole time , thunder rumbles incongruously in the distance aside from the spectacular debris that the storms strew across the landscape , most of the tornadoes pictured in the film look surprisingly benign in real life , even a typical middlesize thunderstorm provides far more drama and a better buildup darker clouds , heavier rain , scarier lightning , louder thunderclaps perhaps the technical wizards for twister were so busy designing their computerized funnels they forgot that the prelude to a tornado \( or even a thunderstorm \) is threefourths of the drama several of the film s twisters have no thunder and lightning attached and no rain more often than not , the clouds from which they drop are a medium to dark gray rather than jet black in one scene in which a twister bears down on a couple driving through a cornfield , the camera shows a tractor being hurled through the air while the trees in the background give no indication that there is any wind at all the special effects all but collapse near the end of the film when the storm chasers encounter what is touted as a megatornado , a monster with over 300mileanhour winds and a base a mile wide this bogus digital cataclysm does n't look like anything in nature unless you count the sanitizing whirlwinds that whip across the screen in cleanser commercials this funnel looks more like a dust storm than a tornado , and there is no accompanying thunder , lightning , rain or hail you really ca n't blame the makers of twister for these lapses although it would have been far preferable for the film makers to have set up their cameras and waited for a real thunderstorm on which to graft their special effects , they might have waited for days or weeks before the right shower conveniently arrived and even then , the technical problems created by an actual thunderstorm would probably have made filming impossible when it comes to climatic verisimilitude , twister finally is n't any better or worse than the typical hollywood movie in its handling of the weather how many otherwise realistic films have been saddled with preposterously abrupt and phonylooking intrusions of rain \? on a clear day , out of nowhere there is a sudden bolt of lightning along with a clap of thunder and it instantly begins to pour when the camera points to the sky , more likely than not , what it observes during one of these torrents are fairweather clouds shot through a filter and underexposed to make them look darker for those who insist on looking at movies of real storms instead of phony ones , home video now goes where hollywood \( with its cumbersome widescreen technology \) cannot follow until the 1960 s , actual tornado footage was a rarity in the age of home video , any tornado that menaces a populated area is likely to be recorded professional storm chasers who dash across plains in search of tornadoes have brought back spectacular storm scenes the weather channel has successfully marketed several video compilations of tornadoes , and the weather found on these documentary slices of meteorological fury is much scarier than anything to be seen in twister what you wo n't find in these home videos is what hollywood can do better than anyone in scenes in which an oil tanker goes up in flames , a house drops out of the sky and tractors fly around the screen , twister does a bangup job of giving audiences the ultimate vicarious thrill it has little to do with the weather and everything to do with sitting in a comfortable theater and wallowing in images of sheer , rampant destruction photos the way the world ends a real tornado in texas from a weatherchannel video called storm chaser warren faidley \( weather channel \) \( pg 28 \) for realism , twister is barely up on

some events really are lifealtering , and for morton feldman , the american composer whose music will be performed this week as part of the lincoln center festival , meeting john cage in 1949 at a concert in carnegie hall was one of them by then cage already knew everyone worth knowing in the arts , or at least he knew people who knew those people , and they gathered at his loft on the lower east side of manhattan there , through cage , feldman became acquainted not just with other gifted composers but also with visual artists he soon became part of a circle that included philip guston and jackson pollock , mark rothko and franz kline the leading abstract expressionists , who also became known as the new york school painters feldman hung out with them at the cedar bar in greenwich village and dedicated scores to them , and , he later insisted , they were the ones who most influenced his music today it s a given among musicians that feldman s music is somehow akin to abstract expressionist art but how \? that s an awfully tough question , not least because it is n't altogether clear what links the various abstract expressionists there s the added problem with feldman that during the late 1970 s , when he began to compose longer and longer pieces , music critics started to describe him , along with very different composers like philip glass and steve reich , in terms of yet another art movement , minimalism what was feldman , ultimately , an abstract expressionist , a minimalist , or both , or neither \? first a word about the man a rabelaisian figure with a thick new york twang , he once described himself as a cross between ludwig wittgenstein and zero mostel he was born in new york in 1926 , studied with the american composer wallingford riegger and the germanborn stefan wolpe , and died in 1987 in buffalo , where he was the edgard varese professor of music at the state university of new york it s paradoxical that feldman ended his career as an academic , because , in the 1950 s and 60 s , at least , his music represented a distinct alternative to the sort of stuff coming out of universities a lot of that academic music had to do with elaborating on the intricacies of serialism along with the other socalled new york school composers \( cage , earle brown and christian wolff among them \) , feldman was thinking in different terms he wanted to give performers freedom and flexibility , out of which , he believed , would come a kind of collaborative originality at first he was n't as concerned with precisely which notes they played as with the quality of the sounds they made so he conceived a new notation that consisted of rows of boxes with numbers in them , the boxes and numbers indicating how many notes to play at a time , and for how long to play them , but not which notes to play , beyond a broad designation of high , middle or low register feldman wanted to control the density and combination of timbres , and also the dynamics , which were mostly to be quiet or very quiet he was strongly influenced by cage s interest in silence and in what cage , a follower of eastern philosophies , called the void feldman s music , with its attenuated , tremulous phrases , sounded like shifting breezes meditative , disembodied , freeform , often sliding toward inaudibility in later works like piano \( three hands \) , of 1957 , and last pieces , of 1959 , he indicated which pitches to play but not their duration later still , when he returned to conventionally notated scores , his focus remained on washes of sound , though now of extreme duration his string quartet no 2 \( 1983 \) , if played as he wrote it , lasts up to six hours \( the kronos quartet will play the whole thing on saturday evening at alice tully hall as part of the festival , and there are three other feldman concerts , involving different musicians , at the society for ethical culture , 2 west 64th street , on friday , saturday and next sunday \) what , if anything , does all this have to do with abstract expressionism or , for that matter , minimalism \? it s somewhat beside the point but interesting that certain experimental scores from the 1950 s by feldman s colleagues cage and brown , meaning the actual pages of their music , resemble abstractions by kandinsky or mondrian in brown s case , for instance , the score of december 1952 consists of dots , dashes and varied rectangular bars irregularly disposed on a blank page in a way that looks like a mondrian of around 1917 or , even more , a guston from the early 50 s for his part , feldman thought of the resemblance not in terms of scores but of sounds he spoke about sound as if it were something physical , malleable , something to be shaped , like pigment at one of his early concerts \( which were attended , by the way , mostly by artists \) , he told the audience , i have always been interested in touch rather than musical forms this remark is revealing , because guston , who was his closest artistfriend , once said almost the reverse look at any inspired painting it s like a gong sounding it puts you in a state of reverberation clearly , guston and feldman in the 1950 s were thinking about something similar , namely , the undefinable territory between music and art an abstract concept that allowed both of them to evoke the immateriality they were aiming for
pebble beach , calif , feb 1 while it usually is true that there are lies , damned lies and statistics , here is one stat that is gaining credence with each passing week justin leonard leads the pga tour statistics in the allaround category , and he is building a strong case that his really is a golf game with no apparent weaknesses just one week after losing one of the most thrilling suddendeath playoffs in years , here he is again bold , brash and barely old enough to sample any of the wines from monterey county , leonard is drinking deep draughts of good fortune he is just 23 years old , with a baby face , a preppie wardrobe and the swagger of a man who knows exactly where he is going where he is right now is on top of the leader board , tied for the lead with the nike tour grad john elliott in the att pebble beach national proam leonard shot a round of fiveunderpar 67 at poppy hills , one of three courses where the tournament is contested here in the del monte forests on the cliffs above carmel bay leonard and elliott led a group of 11 players at fourunder 68 that group includes joey sindelar and fuzzy zoeller , who played at spyglass hill , and the rookie franklin langham and loren roberts , who shot their rounds at pebble beach on a cloudy , cool afternoon , leonard basically set fire to the very wet poppy hills course , birdieing seven holes and bogeying two and reminding everyone how close he came last week to beating phil mickelson at the phoenix open i do n't think i did anything to lose that golf tournament , leonard said any time you birdie the first playoff hole , you kind of expect to win the golf tournament but i just ran into a buzz saw he did , and he came out of it unscathed it was there that it became readily apparent just how toughminded and tenacious leonard is with a raucous crowd alleged to be more than 156 , 875 screaming for mickelson , the arizona state product and local resident , leonard just kept hitting drives in the fairway and making pressure putts mickelson finally prevailed with a birdie on the short , parfour 17th , where leonard missed a 6foot birdie attempt mickelson came away drained and impressed there s no question in my mind that justin is ready to win , said mickelson , who shot a round of 72 today at poppy hills it s unfortunate he has n't come out on top , but i 'd have to say he 'll win this year in fact , that s a pretty safe bet it would n't be a bad bet to make this week leonard is playing his relatively mistakefree game , hitting fairways \( 12 of 14 \) and greens and making putts when he has the opportunity his swing , when it is in the slot , is a compact move that essentially eliminates the legs from the equation it is not elegant , but it is very effective i 've been playing really well for the last three weeks , he said , but i have n't been that much in sync on the greens i feel good about everything in my game now all i'm seeing is the pin , and that s a great feeling i seem to be doing everything fairly well in other words , best allaround there were a few snickers from numbers mavens when leonard won the tour s allaround category last year after all , he did n't win a tournament \( he had two runnerup finishes \) and was in the top 10 in only one category birdies greg norman , a threetime winner on tour , finished 19th in the category but , while the tour is refining the way it computes the allaround category this year , leonard is back on top of it after four tournaments none of the stats really mean that much to me , he said the one that really means something is stroke average with his putting stroke , which is borderline beautiful , leonard s stroke average will continue to be low and going lower he missed a couple of makable putts on the back nine today , but it did n't bother him after what he showed last week , when he did n't lose his cool after fans were openly rooting against him i heard one guy yell , 'hit the bunker ! ' he said leonard might also be the most allaround unflappable player currently on tour the mists here have swallowed many a young pretender they might yet get him but he will not go easily best allaround will probably be around when it gets down to the end chip shots for the first year in the last 23 , jack lemmon is absent from the tournament he is in london filming a version of hamlet it s a tossup between kevin costner and bill murray as to the crowd s celebrity favorite , but murray has the early edge in the battle for low movie star he and his partner scott simpson teamed for a nineunder 63 , which trailed the leading team of justin leonard and george roberts by five strokes dr sally krueger , the first female amateur to compete in the att , acquitted herself admirably , shooting a round of 79 on her ball from the men s tees krueger , a san francisco anesthesiologist , is a sixtime san francisco amateur champion and a former california amateur champion leonard , who played in her group , said she was fantastic no offense to anybody , but i think there are some ladies on the lpga tour who would have had trouble shooting 79 from those tees photo justin leonard , 23 , on the poppy hills course yesterday inpebble beach , calif leonard is tied for lead with john elliott \( associated press \)
when the police raided the software mailorder business that thomas nick alefantes ran from his los angeles home , they uncovered a counterfeiting operation on a scale typically found only in overseas factories beyond the reach of american softwarecopyright enforcement using relatively lowcost copying equipment , mr alefantes , who pleaded guilty to two felony charges and is to be sentenced this month , amassed millions of dollars worth of cdrom counterfeits of microsoft business software and autodesk computeraideddesign programs , among other pirated software for the american software industry , mr alefantes or captain blood , as he calls himself , after the highseas pirate played by errol flynn in the 1935 film is a personification of the sharp increase it fears in software piracy new , lowcost techniques are making it easier to produce and distribute unauthorized copies of valuable programs even as they worry about the multimilliondollar offshore counterfeiting factories that have bedeviled american software companies in recent years , industry executives are bracing for a surge of onshore counterfeiters abetted by inexpensive cdrom copying devices , or by evereasier access to the internet , where bootleg software can flow like hooch down the mississippi if the prices of cdrom recordables continue to fall , it opens up a whole new front , said robert kruger , a former federal prosecutor who directs copyright enforcement for the business software alliance , an industry group in washington and internet piracy is going to take us off in a hundred new directions if we 're going to keep up with it a continuously updated piracy meter in the group s headquarters indicated last week that the estimated level of illegally copied software had reached nearly 144 million worldwide through the first four days of 1996 in recent years , the illegal distribution of american software internationally has been a major concern and a thorny diplomatic issue for the united states and its pacific rim partners in japan alone , estimated losses from piracy to american and other software companies exceeded 13 billion in 1994 , the last year for which figures are available in china , according to another american trade group , the software publishers association , only 1 of every 50 copies of software is legal throughout asia , software counterfeiters use highspeed cdrom duplicating equipment that can cost 1 million to stamp out copies of software programs , sometimes cramming dozens of different products onto one disk last year in hong kong , for example , microsoft s general counsel , david curtis , said he was able to buy a cdrom containing nearly 70 software titles , including a dozen microsoft programs mr curtis said he paid 50 for a collection with total market value well over 30 , 000 yet the software publishers association said that in the united states , the level of software piracy had been falling even though , with the size of the american market , total losses were among the highest in 1994 compared with 1993 , the value of illegal software produced in this country fell nearly 50 percent , to 105 billion , the association said it attributed the decline in domestic software crime to an education campaign aimed at corporations and to stiffer penalties but thanks to the explosive growth of the consumer cdrom industry and the great popularity of the internet , software piracy seems ready to rise again in the united states we always thought our biggest losses were in corporations , where they were distributing more copies of software than they had purchased , said sandra boulton , director of the antipiracy department at autodesk , whose 4 , 000 autocad design software is popular with architects and engineers , and has been a preferred target of software counterfeiters but now we 're seeing new technologies like the internet and cdrom duplicators play a role , ms boulton said the cdrom drives typically sold with home computers are read only , meaning that they can be used to play cdrom disks containing multimedia games or large reference works , but the computer user cannot alter or copy the disks but lowspeed recordable drives for use with home computers , will soon be priced as low as 500 the cdrom recordable machines have legitimate uses , like storing graphics and large quantities of data that would not fit easily onto floppy disks but the availability of lowcost duplicators opens a new market to software counterfeiters , making it even cheaper for operators following in captain blood s bootprints to do plenty of damage for software programs that are not so large that they require a cdrom s vast storage space , the internet presents a potentially bigger threat in dollar terms \( because it lacks any central authority , the internet is particularly difficult for lawenforcement agencies to monitor for piracy some software publishers have taken to calling it the home shoplifting network \) while pirates had long ago discovered the advantages of distributing software over private electronic bulletin boards , officials today estimate there are already hundreds of internet news groups , mostly under the heading altbinarieswarez on these , software pirates upload programs that any of the world s estimated 30 million internet users can download onto their own computers blurring the ethics and perceived criminality of this form of theft is the fact that many software companies including autodesk and microsoft are increasingly looking to the internet as a medium for selling their software electronically , ms bolton said customers might , for example , be able to download the program they want to buy , and then pay to receive a code that unlocks it and makes it usable publishers worry that network thieves will find a way to unlock these programs themselves and distribute them there is also the challenge for law enforcement agencies of having to interpret copyright and counterfeiting laws written before the arrival of a highspeed communications network none of our laws were written with the internet in mind , said lawrence morrison , the assistant district attorney in los angeles who prosecuted captain blood it s going to be interesting to see if law enforcement can keep up last year , a boston judge dismissed a case against david lamacchia , an mit engineering student accused of illegally distributing more than 1 million in copyrighted software over the internet the judge ruled that there had been no financial gain involved the lamacchia case shows the difficulty of applying existing laws to emerging technologies , said scott charney , chief of the computer crime unit at the justice department

columbia s undefeated team found a way to win yesterday under horrendous conditions of wind and rain at baker field it took a perfect field goal , and perfect execution of all of the kick s elements , to bring the lions their fifth victory of the season , this one by a 30 score over lafayette so the lions , tied with cornell and dartmouth for first place in the ivy league , will go to new haven with a 50 record next saturday to play yale the last time the columbia team reached 50 was 1945 there was only one big play yesterday in wien stadium and that was the field goal mike jennings snapped the wet football to david ramirez , who set it up , and matt linit kicked it true through the shuddering uprights from 24 yards away with 9 minutes 54 seconds left in the fourth quarter we 've practiced that thousands of times , said jennings , who is also the team s defensive right end yes , but not with the wind coming in gusts of 40 miles an hour from the northeast off the harlem river and carrying sheets of rain along with it given these conditions , the 1 , 170 witnesses in the stands and the players and coaches on both sides knew this would be columbia s best and probably only chance to score lafayette had tried three downwind field goals earlier and all had failed ramirez , the columbia wide receiver and field goal holder said i tried to act calm but i was as scared as i 've ever been linit said , never have i kicked in anything like that , but he said he was n't scared i aimed right down the middle and it went right down the middle , he said i hit a good ball i tried to keep it low so the wind would n't get it the wind distorted every other aspect of the game the lafayette field goal kicker , brian menecola , missed attempts of 52 , 49 and 35 yards i thought i had the last one , he said but the wind pushed it out bill russo , the lafayette coach , said it was n't so much the rain it was the wind brutal field conditions were awful and favored the defense it was tough to pitch the ball to a back , to try to run a toss neither team could throw the ball if you threw it with the wind it sailed , or it kicked up going into the wind the poor punters had to be scared to death that their error was going to lose the game the punters survived , however , and both did well in overcoming the crises of errant center snaps and kicks that were deflected but not blocked columbia s punter was linit , a sophomore from columbia , mo , who kicked 11 times for a 295 average ryan cimo punted for lafayette and had eight punts for a 32yard average one of them went 78 yards with the wind of course offensive players could not sustain their blocks long enough for the quarterbacks to get their handoffs to the tailbacks so lafayette had only 60 net rushing yards from 46 rushes , columbia 96 from 61 running plays first downs were hard to come by , with the lions getting only six and the leopards just five columbia gained a total of just 118 yards from 68 plays , lafayette 76 yards from 58 plays the leopards also fumbled 12 times , losing 3 the problem was the snap of the ball from the center to the quarterback , and russo replaced quarterback shawn mchale with the freshman mike palos in the second half mike has big hands , the better to hold on to the ball , russo said lafayette had five turnovers , columbia none zero turnovers that s phenomenal , columbia coach ray tellier said the columbia scoring drive began on the lafayette 33yard line following a 14yard punt return by roy hanks the columbia strategy then shifted , tellier choosing to go with power from the wishbone formation that was used in earlier games in goalline situations as is customary in that formation , marcellus wiley , the 6foot5inch , 270pound defensive end , moved to right halfback , and he made a key play wiley broke an inside run around left end for a 19yard gain to the lafayette 11 he got us closer , tellier said he made it a short field goal four plays later , with the scrimmage line at the 6 , jennings , ramirez and linit came on the field and did their business extra points columbia s path to an ivy league championship , a title last gained by the lions in 1961 \( and shared that year with harvard \) , involves five more league games these are at yale , at home against princeton , at dartmouth , and home again against cornell and brown the lions have two ivy victories , over harvard and penn , both in overtime photos columbia players after yesterday s victory conditions were horrid at baker field , with punts and fumbles deciding the game \( jose r lopez the new york times \) \( pg 1 \) both teams had trouble moving the football yesterday lafayette had 60 net rushing yards from 46 rushes , columbia 96 from 61 running plays columbia s matt linit , right , after kicking the field goal that accounted for the only points of yesterday s game \( photographs by jose r lopez the new york times \) \( pg 4 \)
albany , dec 18 round about midnight on tuesday , the galleries of the state legislature were empty the hordes of spectators , lobbyists and television crews had already begun heading home just about the only ones left were the lawmakers themselves , a blearyeyed and rumpled bunch but there was a buzz in the air anyway , a sense that things could still happen this morning in the final hours of what was to be a special oneday legislative session perhaps there would be a deal on a pay raise for lawmakers , or agreement on giving new york city the money for extra police officers there was also the prospect of a vicious floor fight over a measure to ban a certain type of lateterm abortion but none of it happened in the end , despite a marathon of lastminute meetings , lobbying , negotiations and debate in keeping with albany tradition , important bills suddenly died behind closed doors , casualties of too little time , confusion and armtwisting by legislative leaders what seemed like an imminent deal one minute fell apart the next as one member of the assembly put it things were constantly changing nobody really knew what to expect part of the disorder stemmed from the acrimonious disputes that erupted throughout the night between two of the capitol s three main deal makers gov george e pataki , a republican , and sheldon silver , the speaker of the democraticcontrolled assembly by most accounts , mr silver held hostage issues important to the governor in an effort to exact concessions from him , and vice versa it was a sign of the growing distrust between the two men , as well as a possible preview of how bitter next year s legislative session could be when they take up such complicated issues as changing the state s welfare system i 've been here for 12 years and i 've never seen anything like that , michael balboni , a republican from nassau county , said there is an animosity there that i have never seen before , he added one issue that became a latenight bargaining chip was a bill drafted by the assembly that would provide stipends for members who hold leadership positions in that house democrats who control the assembly accused the governor of refusing to agree on providing the stipends because mr silver did not acquiesce on a number of issues favored by the governor , such as helping utility companies save money stipends have always been an issue on its own , no strings attached , as a matter of professional courtesy , said patricia lynch , a spokeswoman for mr silver this latest incident really places a personal scar on any relationship the governor and the speaker could or would have , she said for his part , mr pataki said of the speaker , i would hope that he appreciates the importance of my job , and i certainly appreciate the importance of his job yet another casualty of the horse trading was an agreement that had apparently been reached early tuesday on extending a new york city tax that had paid for an expansion of the police force but by midnight , the deal began to unravel when mr silver tried to get assurances that mayor rudolph w giuliani would use the tax revenue for additional police officers and school repairs , not for closing the city s budget gap by that stage , however , the senate had adjourned for the night , making a threeway deal impossible i'm not commenting on whether those demands were reasonable , mr pataki said today but i know that the senate and our office first heard of them after midnight perhaps the most potentially explosive issue of the evening centered around mr silver s decision to allow floor debate for the first time on a measure to outlaw a type of lateterm abortion lobbyists representing the roman catholic church and women s groups arrived here early on tuesday to monitor the debate that centered on a procedure referred to as an intact dilation and extraction by doctors , but called a partial birth abortion by abortion opponents but mr silver did not put the measure to a vote until around 3 this morning mr silver also limited the debate to four speakers and allowed members to vote only on the procedural question of whether to add the measure as an amendment to an existing bill this led some people to complain that the vote was a sham with no other aim than mollifying the roman catholic church , a politically potent institution i regret that this body is having to have this important and sensitive discussion in the manner in which it has been brought out here , at 3 15 in the morning , john ravits , a republican from manhattan , said during the debate
seattle , june 12 the mountain is now a molehill no national basketball association team has ever overcome a threegamestonone playoff deficit , but the seattle supersonics officially became a nuisance tonight they postponed michael jordan s thursday golf game the chicago bulls had champagne on ice and a charter waiting on the runway , but that is what airport hangars are for the sonics , who were in no rush to divide playoff shares , shared the basketball instead and found a hero on their clubhouse treadmill nate mcmillan cannot bend over and touch his toes , but those were the sonics on his shoulders tonight the nerve of his sciatic nerve pain has been resonating from mcmillan s lower back to his left hamstring for two weeks now , but he played 14 literally spinetingling minutes tonight he made two 3point bombs \( i can shoot the ball without pain i do n't have to jump , he said \) and he let his teammate gary payton out of pointguard prison in the sonics' 10786 victory over the bulls payton is an off guard in a point guard s body , and with mcmillan handling the ball at the top of the key and distributing like a member of the united states post office payton was free to be himself payton ran his defender , michael jordan , through a myriad of screens , posted jordan up and took jordan out to 3point land payton scored 21 points , lobbed to shawn kemp whenever possible and became his old motormouth self how was this possible \? nate , nate mcmillan , payton said mcmillan , a sonic for a decade , had missed games 2 and 3 of this series , but played tonight because i have a whole summer to rest besides , it s more inspirational to my team when i'm in a sonic uniform instead of a nice suit a lot of the guys , i saw a glow in their faces when they saw me tonight gary told me it motivated him even more he held three intriguing and private discussions today that persuaded him to play and then he persuaded the clubhouse man to leave the treadmill motor running first , mcmillan asked his wife , michelle , if he should play , and she told him to take his body for a test drive before the game and then decide next , he asked his brother , randy , if he should play , and randy mcmillan said , yes , you idiot well , nate mcmillan said late tonight , my brother said , 'play' no hesitation from him he was almost , you 're playing regardless' he was n't feeling sorry for me like my wife was he was , 'play , dude' next , he did not ask his coach if he should play he told his coach he was playing he said , 'i want to dress , ' coach george karl said no way i was n't going to play him i mean , i 've said all along , nate is the glue to this team i do n't know if he can play like that in game 5 , but nate gives us confidence he gives gary the opportunity to run around the way we need him to run around the mirage of the mcmillan injury is that he can walk without a limp but he cannot trot without a limp he could not finish a 40yard dash if he tried , which is why he said tonight , if this were 3 on 3 , half court , i 'd be cool but sometimes these are halfcourt games mcmillan loped up the court and drained an arching 3pointer to cap a 142 seattle run that ripped the game open in the second quarter then , he drilled another 3pointer when the bulls were within 13 points in the third when he was removed from the game each time the second time after scottie pippen and mcmillan collided , tweaking his back he kept on running straight to the locker room he could not bear to sit down he might never have got up so he charged straight to the clubhouse to stretch and walk on the treadmill he walked , he estimated , about five miles and now the sonics are maybe only three miles behind the bulls before tonight s victory , there was gallows humor in the seattle locker room karl said he had run out of pep talks \( what , you wanted knute rockne \? he said \) , and when he told payton he had to cover no 23 on the bulls , his only advice to payton was , good luck but now there is a game 5 where there used to be a jordan round of 18 holes what does my team have to do to show it has class \? karl said beat chicago four straight \? i 'll take that

jersey city , dec 26 in one decrepit jersey city neighborhood , where broken drug vials crunch underfoot and the odor of burnt buildings lingers after every rainfall , community organizers say converting the chaotic elementary school to a public school run by parents , not the local school board , will reverse years of stunted learning in quietly affluent princeton , whose students habitually produce bluechip test scores , a group of parents hope that creating a small , autonomous public school under a special charter from the state , free from some state rules , will spur the kind of intensive learning more common to german or japanese grade schools the outline for the newark charter school for innovative education proposes spending 5 million to give every student a computer and video camera and in the atlantic county town of galloway , a team of parents want to create a kindergarten with 200 children and 12 teachers , replacing the allday kindergarten that was eliminated when the town s explosive growth left no room for it in all , 36 groups of parents and educators hope to take advantage of new jersey s new charter school law to join one of the fastestgrowing movements for school change in the nation new jersey s department of education is due to announce on jan 15 which socalled charter schools will be financed next fall charter school laws allow parents , teachers and other community groups to organize and administer free public schools with limited enrollments that are paid for with state and local school funds , but remain independent of local school boards despite the diversity of visions , the proposed charter schools do share at least one trait the very idea ignites enraged arguments about whether such schools can actually deliver a more intimate teaching experience without undermining the ideals of a public education accessible to all public school officials are also dismayed that the state money for each student in a charter school comes from the district s state aid so , the total state aid is the same , but the district loses control over part of it in jersey city , where even the mayor wants to set up a charter school , the deepest bitterness swirls around a plan to convert an existing public school into a charter it is the lone such attempt statewide it is unfair for us to create charter schools for a few children while the rest are left out in the cold , contended kabili tayari , the president of the board of education in turn , backers are accusing the board and the teachers' union of using a smear campaign they are trying to paint this picture of a ridiculous freewheeling school with no standards whatsoever , said silvana f mazzella , a local organizer in princeton , the proposed charter school , for 72 students , roused one of the angriest school board fights in memory even the graduate degrees of the charter school proponents were flung back at them to bolster arguments that charters are elitist , wouldbe private schools financed by picking taxpayers' pockets so it seems that members of this school have only two choices , which is an academic specialty or a professional career , roared todd tieger , a school board member who opposes the idea , during a debate last month now i want to ask you who s going to collect your garbage \? both clinton and gop support charter idea since charter schools were first introduced in minnesota in 1991 , 24 other states and the district of columbia have embraced the concept about 500 schools are open and hundreds more are expected , despite widespread opposition from local school boards and teachers' unions president clinton has urged states to let teachers try them , and the republican party platform endorsed the idea in new york state , the legislature is expected to address the issue soon new york city permits a close cousin of charter schools with its program of alternative schools , some of which served as models for the new jersey groups drawing up their own blueprints chancellor rudy crew has suggested a special district for alternative and charter schools the connecticut department of education is weighing 29 applications for charter schools under its new law , which allows 24 charters approval is expected in the spring new jersey s laws actually allow for 135 charter schools they face intensive local scrutiny because a recommendation from the local school board is part of the application process , although it is not binding on the commissioner of education last week 19 of the schools were approved by their local school districts and 13 were rejected , while four applications were unresolved although most of the proposals came from decayed urban districts like jersey city , newark and trenton , virtually every region of the state generated at least one the schools have to find their own buildings and usually some private backing to supplement state financing all the schools promise more individual attention , tailoring the state s new curriculum standards and the speed of instruction to each child s pace

johannesburg , oct 11 south africa s first attempt to hold senior apartheidera officials accountable for atrocities against blacks ended in acquittals today when a judge found magnus malan , the country s former minister of defense , not guilty of murder charges the case against mr malan and 15 codefendants was brought by prosecutors in an effort to hold top south african officials responsible for the torture , murder and disappearance of countless blacks during more than 40 years of white supremacist rule president nelson mandela moved quickly to head off any anger at the ruling , saying that he fully accepted the judgment of the court if south africa wished to build its democracy , mr mandela said in a statement , then we must respect the institutions of government , and the judiciary is a very important arm of government south africa s new leaders are seeking to strike a delicate balance between justice and retribution in addition to bringing criminal charges against some former officials , the country has created a truth and reconciliation commission in hopes that many of those involved in atrocities will come forward , confess and ask for amnesty rather than risk prosecution so far , few who are not already in jail have done so , gambling perhaps that there is not the prosecutorial will or skill to pursue them mr malan was accused of plotting to arm and train the assassination squad that attacked the home of an african national congress supporter in 1987 the target of the attack was not home , but the gunmen sprayed his small house near durban with gunfire killing 13 people , most of whom were women and children asleep after a prayer meeting the defendants ranged from black policemen to some of the country s most powerful former army generals the judge calling the prosecution s case sloppy and its witnesses unreliable , found all of them not guilty although prosecutors did call several midlevel defense ministry officials as witnesses , none provided direct evidence linking mr malan or his aides to the attack the victims' relatives reacted with rage to the verdict accusing the prosecutor who brought the case of bungling it intentionally mbusi ntuli , whose father and three sisters were killed in the raid , said the result proved that nothing had changed in south africa this is south african justice , mr ntuli said it has always been like this i feel very bitter after the verdict , mr malan stood on the court house steps in durban and said he was relieved the sevenmonth trial was over reading from a prepared speech alternately in english and afrikaans , the 66yearold former general who had headed south africa s total onslaught campaign against antiapartheid groups , said he believed justice had been done and he praised mr mandela for refusing to intervene earlier in the case , when former white leaders asked him to grant the defendants amnesty due to him , we were able to defend ourselves in a court of law , mr malan said all those who believe in democracy can begin to have hope in the future after the verdict , archbishop desmond m tutu of cape town said that the truth commission might yet conduct its own investigation of the issues raised in the malan trial he also warned that perpetrators should not see the outcome of the trial as any reassurance he pointed to convictions in two other recent cases and said perpetrators should not breath any sigh of relief so far the commission has received 2 , 000 applications for amnesty , but most of them come from convicted criminals serving sentences for crimes which had no political motive the likelihood of an acquittal in the malan trial became evident thursday when judge jan hugo began reading his lengthy verdict and acquitted the six defendants who were accused of actually carrying out the raid although he did not get to the higher ranking defendants on thursday , judge hugo made it clear that he was contemptuous of the prosecutors case he said the chief investigator s testimony had been irrelevant and he said the prosecution s two key witnesses , former midlevel army officers , were unbelievable judge hugo also questioned why the attorney general who prosecuted the case , tim mcnally , failed to use other police and military officials to corroborate evidence during the sevenmonth trial after reading his verdicts , the judge denied three state witnesses immunity from future prosecution for any crimes they confessed while testifying he said they had not been truthful when testifying but mr mcnally said he would not pursue charges against them the state had charged mr malan and his codefendants with creating the assassination squad because they were intent on pitting south africa s two largest black parties against each other the indictment said the assassination squad was organized late in 1985 , when the head of the zulubased inkatha freedom party , chief mangosuthu gatsha buthelezi , came to the white government looking for protection from the african national congress , which was supported by most of the country s blacks the indictment said the white government secretly trained 200 inkatha men in tactics like house penetration and attacks on identified targets the indictment also said that once the men had been trained they became restless and wanted to use their skills , so they were allowed to choose an congress target but judge hugo said today that although mr malan and other top generals were involved in planning the military operations against antiapartheid figures , they had no idea these would include assassinations beginning in the early 1960 s , the white south african government and the congress were locked in a violent struggle in which blacks sometimes used guerrilla tactics such as bombings against the oftenruthless white security forces judge hugo described the 1987 attack on the home of victor ntuli in the kwamakutha township as a tragic fiasco no doubt carried out by men who had been trained by the white government he said there was no evidence the massacre had been ordered by the men on trial or that it had been an officially planned or authorized military exercise in addition to mr malan , those acquitted today included two other generals , a vice admiral , a senior policemen , two military officers and the secretary general of inkatha after today s verdicts , 100 inkatha supporters danced and sang outside the courthouse as police looked on mr mcnally told reporters he felt let down by his key witnesses and denied that political pressure affected the conduct of the case i worked night and day in order to succeed in this trial , he said i cannot be held responsible for the shortcomings of my witnesses photo former

of all the descriptions that capture the vastness of the new york city public school system , perhaps none is as telling as this it took officials until noon yesterday , a full six months after the opening of school , to complete the count of every student enrolled for the year it is 1 , 056 , 251 , an increase of 23 , 109 over the previous school year that the board of education spends so much time on the tally much of it double and triplechecking the number shows its critical importance the enrollment number helps determine how much money the school system gets from the city and state at a high school with 2 , 000 students , an undercount of just 25 could mean a loss of 45 , 000 in aid enough to pay a teacher for the year the official enrollment number is actually a snapshot of how many students were in school last oct 31 officials say that is the date school attendance is at its peak \( and , therefore , yields the most aid \) some students begin dropping out in november and others graduate in january every year on oct 31 , the system s 1 , 100 schools play a huge game of musical chairs , stopping the turntable and counting the students in classrooms at that moment it would be much easier counting clutch plates at the general motors plant in tarrytown , said wayne trigg , the board official who oversees the census it s not just inventory control we 're tallying real people and real life is complicated this year , for the first time , most schools are linked to computers tracking attendance but instead of speeding up the count , the new technology slowed it down , as attendance secretaries , long accustomed to compiling records in oldfashioned , red roll books , struggled to learn the new electronic system and because of the temptation for schools to add phantom names to computer rolls to receive more money , as occasionally happens , board officials also compared those rolls to the individual , handwritten counts made and signed by all teachers on oct 31 as in the past , those tallies took a month or more to reach the board s fact checkers , pushing the counting into early december by then , officials at the board s headquarters in downtown brooklyn had an estimated enrollment which , as it turned out , was within 251 students of the final total then came spot audits for a quarter of the city s schools , some chosen at random and others because of discrepancies in their records with a day s warning , the schools were visited by monitors who audited the handwritten attendance books and computer records with the sobriety of the internal revenue service for beverly alexander , the principal of public school 29 in cobble hill , brooklyn , the day of reckoning came on a bonecold morning in late january when daniel carponcy , the chief auditor in the board s monitoring office , arrived with an armload of reports under his arm maureen , the principal bellowed to her attendance secretary , maureen monaco could you come through the door , and prepare to be boiled in oil ! over the next six hours , without a break , mr carponcy and his assistant , lucille attianese , retired to a fourthfloor office with attendance records from all 33 classes twentyseven for 304 , ms attianese said , reading from a record that showed 27 pupils in a thirdgrade class great , mr carponcy said grade 3 is on the money ! as in other schools , the population of ps 29 can be difficult to pin down many of the students , the principal said , are immigrants from the middle east and central america , and their parents sometimes register them in advance for the fall semester , take them back to their home country over the summer and return in midwinter , if at all in the end at ps 29 , mr carponcy determined that the school had accurately counted its enrollment 780 students , two more than last year but there was a problem with the computer records the enrollment number includes longterm absentees registered students who had not , as of oct 31 , attended a day of school these students are supposed to be highlighted so that the district does not receive financial aid for them mr carponcy discovered that the ps 29 computer records had not designated 10 of those students , which if not caught would have meant extra money for the school but the paper copy of the report was correct , so mr carponcy attributed the omission not to greed but to an innocent clerical error for ms alexander , the principal , the discrepancy raises a point for all the automation the computers bring , she told mr carponcy , we 're drowning in paper jean del buono , a secondgrade teacher , estimated that she spent an hour each week and an hour at the end of the month filling out three types of attendance sheets i think it s absurd it takes so long , she said while sympathetic , mr carponcy emphasized that the exercise was vital what we would like to do is get the burden down but have the reliability remain , he said by the middle of this month , those figures will have dollar values some districts , with fewer students than estimated , will be asked to return about 1 , 800 for each student who did not materialize others will benefit from higher numbers we have to be like the umpires in a game , calling it like we see it , mr carponcy said of his role in all this it s money we treat it very seriously we ca n't be wrong chart keeping track enrollment on the rebound shows the studentpopulation in new york city \( in the hundred thousands \) from 1970 through 1995 \( board of education \)
after his arkansas razorbacks won their first game in the east region last week , coach nolan richardson began talking about how his 12thseeded team really was not supposed to be in the national collegiate athletic association tournament he also said he really was not supposed to be coaching a team into the second round there was n't a hint of sarcasm in his voice not even a take my team , please later , richardson was asked why he felt that way i was trying to make a joke , he said but none of you laughed richardson has at times displayed a persecution complex , as he did during his team s run to the national championship two years ago , so it was difficult to determine whether he was working a henny youngman routine but after the razorbacks raced through fifthseeded penn state and marquette , the no 4seeded team , to advance to the final 16 , the joke was on the ncaa tournament selection committee the committee had deemed arkansas a regional alsoran , based on the team s weak regularseason finish \( 35 in the last eight games \) and its record \( 97 \) in the southeastern conference but if things go as richardson and his team plan , they could be laughing all the way to the final four first , the razorbacks \( 2012 \) , who are not even ranked among the top 25 teams in the nation in either the associated press or usa today cnn polls , will have to get past umass \( 331 \) , the east region s topseeded squad and the no 1 team in the nation the two teams meet thursday afternoon in a semifinal game at the georgia dome in atlanta they 're the no 1 team in the country and we 're number nothing , richardson said they 're supposed to beat us if i'm the coach playing arkansas , i 've got to be a little bit worried the ball is in their court they 've got to win we do n't have to win the razorbacks have been to the final 16 in six of the last seven years , and though this season s edition lacks experience they start four freshmen and a junior , and only three players \( two are walkons \) are back from last year s championship runnerup team they have a coach who can talk them through some of the rough spots because of their style of play , a blend of pressure defense and quick transition offense that makes for a frenetic pace at both ends of the floor , the razorbacks are difficult to prepare for in a singlegame elimination setting arkansas sent marquette , a team it had never faced , into fits they 're very unique , said marquette coach mike deane , whose team wilted under arkansas s relentless pressure , committing 17 turnovers , shooting only 268 percent and getting outrebounded \( 5447 \) i do n't know if nolan even knows when they 're going to trap and when they 're not they really cover quickly for one another it s an athletic team , a young team that s had to go through some adversity but they have a whole season behind them now and they have a lot of confidence in each other the adversity deane mentioned dates back to the beginning of the season when 10 players from last year s razorback team , which lost to ucla in the ncaa championship game , departed then , jesse pate and sunday adebayo , juniorcollege transfers , were ruled ineligible by the ncaa 23 games into the season there was a mixup on when the grades were transferred from their respective junior colleges and they began practice eight days earlier than they should have at the time , pate was the razorbacks' leading scorer , averaging 134 points a game , and adebayo was the leading rebounder with 76 a game \( he averaged 105 points a game \) i do n't know of any team in the country that has lost 10 players and then lost their leading scorer and rebounder in the same season , richardson said and still made it through two rounds of the ncaa tournament , he could have added richardson has filled the gaps nicely , relying more on the leadership of his junior center , darnell robinson , a holdover from the 1994 championship team and a starter on the 1995 runnerup team also , the steadying hand of the freshman point guard kareem reid \( 66 assists a game \) and the shooting touch of the freshman pat bradley , who has averaged 135 points in the last 11 games , have helped , too derek hood , a freshman forward , has matured into the type of menace around the basket that gives arkansas some force inside he has grabbed 58 rebounds in the last six games \( averaging 97 \) and his 195 rebounds are the secondhighest ever by a razorback freshman since sidney moncrief , arkansas s careerleading rebounder , had 213 in 1976 reid , who has 211 assists this season , broke lee mayberry s singleseason school record for assists \( 209 set in 1991 \) in the marquette game and has shot 163 free throws more than double the next highest total of 78 by hood richardson calls reid the head of the razorbacks he may not have any blood that runs through his veins , richardson said of reid 'it seems like nothing fazes him , which is the only thing that makes good players great players reid said he has experienced pressure before in high school , said reid , who played for st raymond s in the bronx some would think that the razorbacks have already overachieved to me it s a nice accomplishment , richardson said but it does n't stop here i was n't playing this year to get to the sweet 16 i'm trying to win another national championship photo if the arkansas razorbacks keep up their pace , coach nolanrichardson and guard pat bradley may be waltzing all the way to the national championship \( associated press \) \( pg b11

in a victory for schools chancellor rudy crew s effort to exert control over troubled local school districts , the justice department reversed an earlier ruling yesterday and approved his plan to take over a district in the south bronx dr crew has waged a longrunning battle with members of the district 12 school board , whom the chancellor suspended in a dispute over the board s choice of a superintendent the performance of schoolchildren in the district ranks among the lowest in the city , and dr crew has said he has a responsibility to intervene last month , justice department officials in washington rejected the chancellor s move to suspend the board members and install trustees to run the district the officials said dr crew had violated the voting rights act and deprived hispanic and black residents of the district of their right to choose their own school board members the chancellor continued to insist on his right to suspend the board , but he offered the justice department a revised plan giving parents a greater say in the appointment of trustees yesterday , justice department officials sent the board of education a letter indicating they were satisfied with the new plan school officials lauded the decision , saying it would allow the chancellor to improve education in district 12 but david golub , a spokesman for the chancellor , also said the case highlighted the need for changes in the governance of the school system , to make clear the chancellor s powers to intervene in local districts when necessary the justice department ruling applies only to the dispute over district 12 , and does not address the broad issue of the chancellor s authority to intervene in local districts dr crew has pressed the legislature to grant him greater powers to act in such cases still , mr golub said , the federal decision allows us to move forward in dealing with the problems in district 12 louis r maldonado , the ousted board president , said that he was stunned by the decision and that he and the other members were prepared to sue the chancellor and the justice department the justice department gave us a decision a month ago and then turned it around just because chancellor crew changed the wording , he said late last night he s still violating voters' rights the justice department ruled last month that the chancellor had acted improperly in august when he suspended district 12 s nine board members over a disagreement about their choice of a new superintendent , replaced them with three temporary trustees and announced a plan to install five permanent trustees angry board members camped outside the district office after they were refused entry by school security guards dr crew became entangled in the board s decisionmaking process when it voted to hire alexander castillo , a former board member who is the principal of an elementary school in east harlem , as superintendent dr crew objected , saying that students at mr castillo s school had performed poorly on citywide reading and math tests , with only 24 percent reading or working on mathematics at their grade level in 1996 under the new plan , a committee comprised of the presidents of all parent associations in district 12 will establish criteria , screen applications and interview candidates the committee will recommend eight candidates to dr crew , who will appoint five as community trustees in the new york city school system , the central board of education and the chancellor , who is appointed by the board , have broad authority over curriculum and direct control of the city s high schools since 1969 , however , state law has given elected school boards in the city s 32 districts control of elementary and junior high schools , a division of authority that has often led to disagreements although dr crew s predecessors repeatedly challenged the 1969 decentralization law , none did so with the determination that dr crew has shown since he became chancellor a year ago

miami , may 16 valujet flight 592 , which crashed here on saturday apparently after an explosion and fire on board , may have been carrying highly reactive chemicals because a shipping clerk did not recognize them as hazardous materials , and nobody doublechecked , according to people involved in the investigation the chemicals were in canisters called oxygen generators , used on some planes to supply emergency masks with oxygen a maintenance contractor had removed the canisters from other valujet planes in miami at the airline s request because their shelf life had expired , and delivered them to the airline in boxes valujet then put those boxes on the illfated flight to take them to its headquarters in atlanta an employee of the contractor , sabretech , labeled the boxes empty , sabretech officials said that notation would ordinarily refer to the canisters , not the boxes , and would ordinarily mean that the canisters had been discharged , that is , they had gone through their chemical reaction , generating oxygen and heat and becoming mostly inert if discharged , the canisters would be safer to transport but federal investigators say they now believe that at least some of the canisters may not have been discharged , and were therefore capable of feeding or starting a fire they consider them a leading suspect in the crash kenneth p quinn , a lawyer for sabretech , a phoenix company known as dynair tech until it was bought by the sabreliner corporation last year , said , it is unclear whether the employee knew that the substance in the canisters constituted a hazardous material , and if so , whether the material had been discharged mr quinn said it was the responsibility of valujet , as the licensed airline , to check whether any materials put on board were hazardous gregg kenyon , a spokesman for valujet , stressed this evening that when valujet received the boxes , they were labeled to indicate that the canisters were empty he said that because the accident was under investigation , that was all he would say mr quinn said the canisters , 50 to 60 in all , in five boxes , could have been thrown away , sold or refurbished by valujet at the airline s option he said the company had returned them to valujet for appropriate disposal he said a shipping tag on the boxes had two notations empty and customer furnished material returned per customer instructions mr quinn said his company was now investigating whether the canisters were discharged it is standard practice in the industry for such canisters , when carried as cargo , to be discharged and packed in strong , airtight boxes it is unclear whether the boxes containing the canisters on flight 592 were adequate the chief accident investigator , gregory feith , of the national transportation safety board , said at a midday briefing near the crash scene , we do n't know what experience the people that were handling these canisters had he added , if you pick up a onepound canister and somebody says they 're off an airplane , they 're old , that may have been interpreted by some to mean something else in fact , he said , that may be why someone placed an empty label on the boxes he said , there s a terminology problem here that we need to clarify mr feith added , we 're going to try to identify who actually handled it , what they saw , what they used to make the evaluation as to whether they are actually full or not full the canisters are not used on dc9 s , the kind of the plane that crashed they are used on md80 s , which valujet also flies , to make oxygen for passenger emergency masks they make oxygen with a chemical reaction that generates tremendous heat but is safe when the canisters are installed for their intended use in a seatback or overhead compartment the safety board , an independent agency that investigates all plane crashes , has found strong evidence of fire and explosion on the plane , and has found paperwork on the ground indicating that oxygen generators were on board it has not suggested a mechanism by which a generator or generators became activated , though , and it is still looking at wiring and other possible sources of explosion or fire sabretech said in a statement today we agree with lewis jordan , president of valujet , that it is premature and irresponsible to engage in speculation over the probable cause of this tragic accident we are cooperating fully with the faa and ntsb thus far none of the generators have been recovered the safety board hopes to find some in the muck of the everglades where the plane crashed and check their serial numbers against maintenance records to determine definitively if they were still potent when shipped at a briefing this evening mr feith questioned the assertion made on wednesday by the federal aviation administration that valujet was not authorized to carry hazardous materials mr feith said the issue of the airline s authority to carry such materials was still a question the investigators would have to resolve valujet contends that even if it is not qualifed to carry hazardous materials for others , an exemption in federal rules allows it to carry its own hazardous materials if it must do so to run the airline on wednesday , senior officials of the faa , who refused to be publicly named , said that if the airline was not authorized to handle hazardous materials , then it could not carry the oxygen generators even if they were valujet s own property , what the industry calls company materials in their search in the everglade , investigators have recovered the flight data recorder , one of the plane s black boxes , and found signs on it consistent with an explosion on board they have also found sootcovered wreckage in addition , before the plane crashed , the copilot reported to the ground that the cockpit and cabin were filling with smoke a possible source of that smoke , investigators said , was three aircraft tires , carried with the generators in the forward cargo compartment today searchers used a heavyduty helicopter to lift major pieces of the wreckage out of the everglades , including two tires , two major landing gear pieces , some pieces of wing and fuselage , and a piece that looks like it s from the rear cargo bay , said robert francis , vice chairman of the safety board investigators are not sure whether the tires were cargo or in use on the plane searchers have also recovered both engines , mr francis said searchers have not found the cockpit voice recorder , which investigators badly want photo as investigators studied why valujet flight 592 crashed inflorida , recovery workers using sky crane helicopters retrieved parts of one of the dc9 s two engines the parts were examined on a

tunis , april 14 pope john paul ii made a oneday trip across the mediterranean to tunisia today , bearing a message of religious tolerance that he hopes to beam to the rest of the islamic world with an eye toward the violent strain of islamic fundamentalism afflicting nextdoor algeria and a glance backward at a long history of fierce encounters between christianity and islam , the pope today used his second trip to an arab country to denounce religious fanaticism none can kill in the name of god , none can accept the infliction of death on his brother , the pope told a gathering of bishops from four north african countries , algeria , tunisia , morocco and libya the 75yearold pope , whose health has been the subject of continuing speculation after recent bouts of fever and nausea , seemed relatively fit , although at times tired , during a full day of events his schedule veered sharply from official pomp and a visit with president zine el abidine ben ali to a final poignant meeting in the ancient roman amphitheatre in carthage there , he addressed some members of tunisia s catholic population of 18 , 000 , mostly foreigners , which the pope described as a small , fragile flock although he has been to many other muslim countries on his 70 trips around the world , the pope has always approached the arab world with caution this is another step in his continuing opening to islam , and it is a long road , said dr jaoquin navarrovalls , the chief vatican spokesman the pope has often said it is his dream to make a visit to the holy land , to retrace the steps of abraham and moses , an iternary that would take him through a halfdozen middle eastern countries , including israel but so far , there are no definite plans for such a trip , although he has received invitations from israel and egypt , among others here in tunisia , an overwhelmingly muslim country of 87 million people , president ben ali was an eager host , anxious to prove both to his neighbors and to the west that he is not hostile to christianity pope visits land of tolerance was the message printed on the front page of tunisia s frenchlanguage newspaper , which , like all news media , is under the president s strict control the same message was displayed on official banners outside the 19thcentury cathedral downtown , where the pope celebrated mass this morning for about 1 , 000 worshipers , most either italian or french built when tunisia was a french protectorate , the cathedral has been slowly emptied of parishioners since 1956 , when tunisia gained independence and the europeans who came in the colonial era returned home on rainy days , the roof leaks and attendence at regular sunday mass is down to fewer than 100 , parishioners said but , they said , the arrival here in 1992 of a jordanianborn , arabicspeaking bishop , msgr faoud twal , has helped improve relations between the church and state several parishioners also said president ben ali has been a helpful partner , even providing a 100 , 000 grant to help repair the cathedral but mr ben ali , who came to power in 1987 and has ruled a virtual oneparty state , has kept firm some say brutal control over islamic militancy in an attempt to keep the civil war in neighboring algeria from spilling over the border the fact is that the government is taking all measures necessary to avoid a repetition of the algerian experience , said monsignor twal we are living in an abnormal context in northern africa do n't ask us for european democracy but the pope , in his final message to the small gathering at the amphitheatre in carthage , gently reminded the tunisian authorities today that tolerance has many faces when the profound aspirations of a people are not satisfied , he said , the consequences can be devasastating , leading to simplistic solutions , which threaten the liberty of people and societies
new delhi , aug 18 with the death toll at 52 in what has been described as india s worst food poisoning case in many years and with 18 more patients still in intensive care , investigators in a textile town north of bombay say they are still unsure whether the episode was a case of mass murder or an accident more than 120 people , most of them migrant workers at local textile plants , became ill 12 days ago after eating lunch at a canteen in bhiwandi , a boom town about 75 miles north of bombay several cooks and kitchen workers at the roadside canteen were arrested after investigators found that rice there contained datura , a poisonous weed of the nightshade family laboratory tests showed the rice contained quantities of the weed , which is otherwise known as thornapple but physicians caring for some of the survivors have questioned whether the small amounts detected could have been the cause of illness reports said the victims , all of them men , began to become delirious within two hours after eating , with symptoms that included heavy salivating and extreme breathing difficulties an account in the pioneer , a newspaper published in new delhi , described wrenching scenes among the victims , most of whom had come to the city to work from distant states like uttar pradesh in northcentral india and were thus without family members to care for them almost all of them could be seen thrashing around , writhing with pain and tied with gauze bandages to their beds , the report said other accounts said that local hospitals had no supply available of an antitoxin that could have helped the men and that it was five days before supplies were flown in from poland the newspaper accounts of the discovery of the poisonous weed and the detention of canteen employees , two of whom fled 1 , 000 miles to their homes in uttar pradesh , also suggested possible motives the accounts said the police were investigating the relationship between one of the detained employees and the canteen owner , who was among those who died they also said the police were probing a possible link to a dispute that began when the owner resisted pressures from other canteen operators to raise prices the episode has focused attention and renewed concern across india on the woeful conditions that face the vast majority of indians who are poor , and in particular on the health hazards caused by the country s dismal public hygiene and sanitation one recent study showed that 700 million of the country s 930 million people , having no toilets , either defecate into buckets or on open land shortcomings in hygiene , especially in the food chain , were emphasized by two other episodes of food poisoning , this time involving schoolchildren , that occurred in the same district as the textile town a week after the canteen disaster almost 440 children , most of them ages 6 to 12 , fell ill after eating milkbased sweets known as pedas that schools distributed at celebrations commemorating india s independence on aug 15 , 1947 the food had been kept unrefrigerated in 90degree heat none of the children died , though many remained in the hospital for days the possibility that the canteen deaths resulted from datura poisoning set indians to delving into folklore , which indicates that the weed has been used for centuries , especially in north india , for various kinds of skulduggery the pioneer reported that datura seeds are often mixed in food and offered to train passengers to knock them off and rob them as early as the 16th century , accounts by early western travelers to india told of servants drugging their employers with the weed in order to rob them and of wives punishing unfaithful husbands by intoxicating them with daturabased potions for decades , indian leaders have promised crash programs to improve conditions this year , prime minister h d deve gowda , who grew up the son of a poor farmer , renewed the pledges in his independence day speech i regret that despite 50 years of independence , basic amenities still elude the rural and urban poor , he said in the speech in new delhi on thursday he said his government would increase spending on the poor and provide at least basic levels of sanitation , electricity and housing for all of india s people by 2000
dr meyer schapiro , university professor emeritus at columbia university , multidisciplinary critic and historian , galvanic teacher , lifelong radical and for more than 50 years a preeminent figure in the intellectual life of new york , died yesterday at the greenwich village house that had been his home for more than 60 years he was 91 as an academic , dr schapiro excelled in two completely different fields it was as a historian and elucidator of romanesque sculpture that he made his name in 1931 he also wrote on 19thcentury and early20thcentury art from courbet and cezanne to mondrian and the abstract expressionists in ways that gave new dignity to the discussion of modern art but it was not in his nature to function as a specialist within any one particular discipline even less was he a satrap of the seminar with specific turf of his own to protect it was , in fact , the very essence of meyer schapiro that he never conceived of any aspect of art , of belief or of language in isolation he regarded all forms , schools and systems of knowledge as interrelated and interdependent as far as he was concerned , he had been put on earth to know , and to make known , the correspondences between them all and he addressed himself not to the insider , but to the generality of intelligent human beings an archetypal jewish immigrant , meyer schapiro arrived in the united states at the age of 3 from lithuania , where jews were subject to periodic and odious harassment it was in new york , the fulcrum and heartland of immigration , that he lived out his life new york made him welcome , nourished his fiery and agile intelligence , and made it possible for him to master one discipline after another with a speed and a thoroughness that have had few parallels in our century what new york had given him , he gave back many times over the painter robert motherwell said in 1974 it was in order to study with meyer schapiro that i came to new york , which was the single most decisive factor in my development he introduced me to european artists in exile here from the war in the 1940 s , and this was the second most important factor in my orientation i have great admiration for him as a sage , though i disagree with him on some judgments i admire him as an irreplaceable man and as an extraordinary representative of the unique greatness of new york city william s rubin , formerly the director of painting and sculpture at the museum of modern art , said few art historians have the eye and mind of a meyer schapiro and none of those shared his extraordinary humanity so when meyer schapiro communed with great art , he saw kinds of things that eluded the rest of us hilton kramer , the editor of the new criterion , said in my generation , one of the key points of entry into the life of art in new york was the experience of hearing dr schapiro lecture on modern painting at the new school for social research those lectures , always crowded with artists and writers , were dazzling performances that left one in no doubt that the great work of the modern painters stood at the very center of life in lecture hall and seminar , dr schapiro would sometimes start from a prepared text or with a purpose that he summarized at the outset his speech at such times might be plain and straightforward to the point of hesitation but before long an almost perceptible halo of cerebration began to wreathe his head as he took off into an empyrean to which he alone had access , ideas and intuitions crowded in from every quarter at such times , all present were drawn into a magic circle that he had been tracing since the late 1920 s it could have been overwhelming , but such was the intellectual courtesy behind it that those in his audience left the room convinced , for just a minute or two , that they were as clever as he was as to the general direction of his work , he himself defined it when , in 1973 , he was given an award by the art dealers association of america the study of art history he said , presupposes that art is a universal and permanent feature of civilized life , and that what we do to preserve it , and to discriminate the best of it , will contribute to future enjoyment as much as to our own our concern with the work of art , however touched by vanity or greed , is a homage beyond selfinterest , he continued through it we surmount , if only at rare moments , the limitations of our striving , possessive selves and , as an old poet says , 'into glory peep' a remarkable memory for scholarly detail all his life , dr schapiro had a capacity for total recall no matter what subject was raised in general conversation , he could usually name not only the necessary books on the subject but the chapter heading and even the page reference that was most appropriate in this regard , he was rarely faulted equally remarkable was his visual memory for works of art that he had once seen and never forgotten when the sculptor jacques lipchitz was newly arrived in new york from europe during world war ii , he spent an evening in dr schapiro s company the talk turned to the great collections of tribal art in the musee de l'homme in paris , and in particular to a piece that he had especially admired to help lifschitz recall it , dr schapiro took a sheet of paper and drew , from memory and to scale , not only the piece in question but every other piece that had been in the case with it some years before he did not see this as anything out of the ordinary
maloca bananal , brazil it is at night when the mountain spills its secrets the macuxi shaman prepares for the moment with devotion , darkening the room , washing his mouth with tobacco juice and crooning he beats leaves against the ground and through the air , so the mountain spirits come rushing to him , as if through a forest they have names and personalities , taken from people he has known antonio , pedro , paraiba this last is the spirit of the shaman s slain son the spirits report that they are withholding their gold and diamonds , so that the miners who invaded the area , devouring river banks with their machines and killing off indians with malaria , will move on ainda tem , diamonds are still left , the spirits whisper the shaman , contato francisco silva , says the mountains contain secret doors , behind which live the region s heroes , villains and the timeless dramas that drive them to one another s throats mr silva , a wiry 60yearold , surrenders himself to the mountain , whose spirits speak to the macuxi indians through him , as they await a momentous government decision on the legal future of the indians' land a recent trek through these vast mountains and savannah , where brazil ends at the magnificent tabletop mountain called roraima , hard by the border with guyana and venezuela , reveals a landscape almost unchanged since european explorers came to south america more than 400 years ago searching for the mythical city of gold , el dorado the mountains are muddy underfoot with the heaviest rainfall in 73 years clouds hang low over their peaks , making travel on the chartered singleengine planes that ply the area s dirt runways a question of patience , luck and money roads are impassable from boa vista , the state capital , more than 200 miles away the conquistadors of an earlier age have been replaced by prospectors from throughout brazil , who claim the land s riches as their national birthright in boa vista the statue of a prospector , hunched and resolute over his gold pan , stands at the central plaza hundreds of ranchers have come , too the state s governor blames leftist priests for agitating the indians , and wild tales abound of a hidden tunnel connecting the oldest macuxi village to the vatican , of a priest masquerading in a dress to elude the authorities and fleeing to guyana with the law on his heels roraima s indians do not appear in civic statues and murals , but they too , have grown determined the state , intent on establishing dominion over the area , has in recent years started projects to build a dam and a road , and to establish a municipal government all steps the macuxi who live here have rebuffed helped by the roman catholic church , the macuxi have become the best organized of brazil s many indian tribes reclaiming their language and culture , they are using the courts and federal government agencies to fend off encroachment they have burned bridges , blocked roads and sabotaged work sites in the coming months , the federal government will decide whether to uphold nearly two decades of work by the macuxi , the catholic church and indian protection officials establishing the tribe s legal claim to a 6 , 500squaremile reserve , about the size of connecticut , along brazil s borders with venezuela and guyana the fates of the macuxi and other indian tribes across brazil were thrown open to question with a decree issued by president fernando henrique cardoso in january the decree subjected their rights to ancestral lands ostensibly enshrined in the brazilian constitution to legal challenges from ranchers , miners , agribusiness interests and state governments here in roraima , the governor has contested the macuxi land claim , and asked that only the specific villages where they now live be protected from outsiders though they number only 15 , 000 , the macuxi say that they need the entire area to support their life of cattle grazing , fishing and shifting farmlands , and that for them , as for many other indian groups here , proximity to nonindians has brought ruin through shamans like mr silva , they seek advice and encouragement from the mountains and rivers , whom they consider the true owners of the land justice minister nelson jobim , who was to advise president cardoso on the objections on july 8 , instead put off a decision on the macuxi claims with a request for more information from the indian protection agency as mr jobim prepared to visit the macuxi region of raposa serra do sol later in july , underscoring the importance of the macuxi in the overall question of indigenous lands , the tension grew among the indians it could be a return to burning and bullets , said patrick tierney , an american writer who has studied the macuxi since 1989 everybody is very frustrated they were expecting some kind of decision the land an alluring place beset by miners through this rainy season , mount roraima remains invisible above the clouds but the allure of the place that sir walter raleigh , in the earliest known account of roraima , described as a crystal mountain like a white church towre covered in jewels and gushing waterfalls , endures
section 212 can be found about a quarter of the way into washington s omnibus new welfare bill , under the numbing title eligibility redeterminations and continuing disability reviews it is , literally speaking , about assistance to disabled children but it is also about something much more embodied in section 212 is the key to understanding the bipartisan embrace of the new welfare overhaul , to decoding the impulse to end welfare as we know it the provision deals with poor , severely handicapped children whose families receive an average of 427 a month in federal aid under the supplemental security income program there are approximately one million such children throughout the country starting next july , the new welfare bill , which the president has said he will sign , will cut the program by 82 billion , eliminating benefits to up to 315 , 000 children in new york state alone , 30 , 000 children will be reassessed if they no longer qualify they will also be at risk of losing their medicaid benefits the cut partly reflects congress s efforts to save money the number of supplemental security cases has grown drastically since a united states supreme court decision in 1990 struck down restrictive federal regulations governing the eligibility of children seeking benefits but section 212 is also a response to fraud under current law , poor children qualify for supplemental security payments in two ways if they suffer from a condition that appears on the government s list asthma or cystic fibrosis or sickle cell disease , for example or if their condition is not listed , but they are nonetheless found by state examiners to be impaired and functioning below the normal level of children their age they might have a rare condition , or attention deficit disorder epidemic among the more affluent or a combination of problems for instance , in the supreme court case , one of the children in the class action was semiparalyzed on one side of his body and developmentally delayed , but his disabilities do not appear on the official list where there is room for interpretation , there is room for abuse , and some examples of blatant fraud have drawn national attention , including a report two years ago on abc s prime time live that and other reports focused on parents who coached their children to feign mental disorders so they could collect ssi payments what became known as crazy checks this inspired congressional outrage and led to studies by the general accounting office , a congressional commission and the social security administration itself though the studies criticized aspects of the program , they all found that the instances of fraud were extremely limited for example , in 1994 the social security administration instructed all states to identify cases of suspected fraud of 690 , 644 cases , the states recommended review of 1 , 229 in only 88 of those suspicious cases had benefits been granted , and the agency determined that all 88 were legitimate the agency also examined 617 cases and found evidence of possible coaching or malingering in 13 in none of those 13 cases had benefits been granted if we were to believe this , we would have to believe that a bunch of poor children were somehow coached by undereducated parents so well that the best psychologists , psychiatrists and social workers would be completely hoodwinked , said richard weishaupt , a lawyer with community legal services inc of philadelphia , which argued the supreme court case it was an absurd notion from the start no matter children who now qualify for benefits based on individual assessments will be reexamined and new applicants will be subject to stricter eligibility standards children will have to demonstrate marked and severe functional limitations of substantial duration the question is whether , in pursuit of fraud , government will deny help to those who legitimately need it representative sander m levin , a michigan democrat who worked on compromise language in the welfare bill , is hopeful we 're going to have to carefully watch the implementation to make sure that the improvements were adequate , he said no one is quite sure how this is going to work out the government has to write new rules , the states have to interpret them , parents have to learn about the new system and lawsuits are inevitable advocates in the field of mental health worry , however , that as with so much of the new welfare bill the sins of a few will hurt the many
from the outset , the daily news conferences giving updates on the recovery and investigation of the crash of trans world airlines flight 800 were unfailingly confident and practiced there was a sense of control in the measured answers , the technical knowledge of the safety experts , even in the top fbi man s tough talk about collaring the cowards who did this always , caution was urged but the televised appearances were deceiving , for the convincing performances in restraint masked a much more complex and frantic scramble to action going on behind the scenes , at least in the first stages of the investigation there , lines of authority were unclear , levels of experience varied , and people fought through sleeplessness for coherence and progress a reconstruction of the investigation shows that at least in its early weeks , it was what one investigator called a shotgun marriage the imperfectly matched cultures of transportation safety experts , the federal bureau of investigation and other agencies the coming together produced its share of fractures indeed , the varying agendas and differing personal styles produced suspicions about everything from news leaks to professional competence the most senior officials with the national transportation safety board wound up furious with their own personnel at the scene , convinced that the agency had ceded control of the inquiry to the fbi the prospect that friendly fire might have destroyed the boeing 747 lingered ominously for investigators for days as the department of defense slowly eliminated all conceivable possibilities distrust was so deep at times that workers with the medical examiner s office and agents with the bureau of alcohol , tobacco and firearms thought their telephone calls were being monitored by the fbi but the reconstruction of the investigation into the july 17 crash shows that in the rush for the kind of answers turned up in an fbi laboratory in washington , people pushed themselves to their limits divers operating far beyond their experience partnered dozens of victims up through the sea s basement of black pathologists , operating in a kind of hypnotic trance , had to be physically pried from the autopsy tables and sent for sleep there have been secret , sober subplots , as well the inquiry forced investigators to confront daily decisions about how much information to make public concerned about causing widespread alarm , they muted their statements on how seriously they were taking the notion that a missile had brought down the aircraft faced with the problem of preserving evidence and extricating victims from tangles of wreckage , investigators finally ordered that no one speak of any bodies found underwater , but only those officially counted and brought to shore the aim was to keep the expectations of family members realistic the investigation has been played out in part on television , in part on a distant expanse of the ocean , and in part behind armed guards at an old airplane hangar where agents and experts , each hoarding his own information , rebuild the aircraft and try to reconstruct the catastrophe but it was in the environment of the forensics laboratory in washington that the investigation s greatest breakthrough occurred the discovery , kept under wraps for roughly two weeks , could in time alter the nature of the investigation the fbi could soon declare the crash a crime and expand its investigation to pursue suspects a lot died with screams across their faces , a senior investigator said of the 230 victims you want to try and answer those screams an initial chaos struggle for order during first days in trying to find these answers , the first response of investigators and rescuers was less than smooth the outfit of agents with guns and badges , aviators and engineers , giant ships and underwater robots , began its work in fits and starts in what was a scene of raw ruination , a hailstorm of humans and aluminum that showered the sea nine miles off shore looking back , those involved in the recovery talk of a frenzy not quite captured in the accounts of the catastrophe s early moments in a stifling heat , investigators worked in protective biosuits the first several days , unsure of what they were dealing with in the recovery , and afraid of its hazards at one point , after reports of hivinfected blood on the flight circulated , a brief panic erupted on the coast guard station dock a glass container broke and something that might or might not have been blood splashed everywhere a madcap cleanup with bleach and brushes followed coast guard ships , thinking they were protecting the quadrant of sea that was , in truth , an enormous , shifting accident scene , briefly kept out boats officially assigned to help in the recovery an impostor in the uniform of an army officer showed up at the command center and helped direct helicopter traffic around the guarded zone the first night and into the next day he was eventually found out , escorted from the scene but was not arrested the authorities said he had done a fine job

sarajevo , bosnia and herzegovina , feb 22 in yet another of the heartrending refugee flights that punctuated the bosnian war and that now mar the peace , thousands of terrified serbs trekked over snowy mountains today , away from their homes near sarajevo with a shortage of vehicles putting many people afoot , men strained under the weight of sacks stuffed with whatever possessions they were able to carry , women harnessed themselves to sleds , and old people herded livestock ahead of them on their way , step by wretched step , toward the bosnian serbs' headquarters in pale the refugees were coming from suburbs of sarajevo that have been in serbian hands since the war began here nearly four years ago , but which are due to come under the control of the muslimdominated government beginning on friday they fear that the new authorities will seek revenge for the long serbian siege of sarajevo one of the refugees , dragana vasa , fled on foot with her husband , daughter and 85yearold father she said she was certain that the muslim police would arrest her husband , who had served in the bosnian serb army , and perhaps the rest of the family as well asked why she did not trust united nations pledges that the new bosnian government police force would protect human rights , she replied , the un has never protected the rights of serbs in this war before leaving , some smashed their windows , doors , furniture , appliances and whatever else they could not carry with them , not wanting to leave anything of value to the muslims who may soon be occupying their houses and apartments several set fire to their homes as they left because there are no firefighters left , the fires smoldered all day many of those who fled today lived in the northern suburb of vogosca , where the government police are due to arrive on friday morning there is a good road connecting vogosca to pale , and the ride takes barely half an hour but that road runs through sarajevo , and many serbs seemed convinced that they risk awful fates if they try to use it a handful passed through in trucks under a hail of rocks from muslim children , but the rest chose to slog along a narrow , unpaved path on a freezing trip that could take 24 hours or more efforts by united nations and nato officials to persuade residents of the suburbs that they have nothing to fear from government police officers had only marginal success appeals were broadcast on local radio stations , and leaflets were printed promising that the new civilian and police authorities moving into serbheld suburbs would guarantee equal opportunity and nondiscrimination for all peoples but peter fitzgerald , the chief of the united nations operation that is to monitor respect for the serbs' rights , conceded in vogosca today , nobody can guarantee the people s safety here in any case , few in vogosca seemed to have heard the radio broadcasts , and no one was seen distributing the leaflets people flooded out of vogosca today as if fleeing the advance of a deadly plague relief agencies refused to help the fleeing refugees , arguing that to do so would make them accomplices to a form of ethnic cleansing kris janowski , a spokesman for the united nations high commissioner for refugees , said the refugees were fleeing largely in response to propaganda hype in the pale media it s a fairly cynical political manipulation , and we do not want to play that game , mr janowski said if we see old people on the road without being able to go farther , or if it s a lifethreatening situation , we will have no choice but to go in and help no trucks or aid workers from relief organizations were seen along the tortuous mountain route today , however , and it would have been all but impossible for any to penetrate the miserable column hundreds of dangerously overloaded cars , trucks , tractors and donkey carts clogged the road , passing dozens of others stalled in the snow and mud streams of refugees not lucky enough to have vehicles trudged slowly forward , facing a night without shelter in subzero temperatures the bosnian serb authorities , who oppose the bosnian peace treaty s provisions called for the bosnian government takeover of the mainly serbian suburbs of sarajevo , have urged serbs living there to flee rather than submit to government authority the serbian leadership promised to establish rest stops and feeding stations for the refugees , but there were none nor had any visible provisions been made in pale , a village of only several thousand inhabitants with no more than a few hundred guest rooms to spare asked if he was angry at bosnian serb leaders for encouraging the exodus but failing to provide means for people to leave , the exhausted mayor of vogosca , rajko koprivica , replied with deep sarcasm , no , i love them i am most angry at the people who created the dayton peace agreement , and especially toward those who decided that muslim police officers should be sent here so quickly , mr koprivica said i'm angry at people who are creating panic here for their own political reasons i'm angry at everybody , but mostly at myself because i trusted people , because i did n't know that people say one thing and do another there is a god , and i think all politicians will be punished , myself included , he lamented people from this town should have been allowed to leave like human beings next door , police chief jovan maunaga said he would leave town before government officers arrive on friday nearly all of his men were already gone it s complete chaos here , mr maunaga said people are bitter because they have to leave their homes fire and vandalism are everywhere , and the international community is looking at this as if nothing happened in vogosca today , banks , schools and clinics were closed many people on the streets were at or past the point of mental collapse one young woman stopped to chat , but when asked why she and her family were preparing to leave , she began breathing heavily and suddenly broke into tears she blurted , they killed my brother , and ran away the international official in charge of resettlement and other civilian issues in bosnia , carl bildt , was among those surveying the barren scene in vogosca today speaking of the town s residents , he said , they have gone , to a large extent , and this is an empty suburb if there is an orderly transfer , it could persuade people to come back , he suggested , trying to find some hope on a bleak and tragic day it s very , very late , but perhaps not too late photos fearful for their safety after their towns come under bosniangovernment control , serbs in the suburbs of sarajevo have been fleeing , and destroying

atlanta , july 21 for three years , they had trained as tense rivals in the same pool at the university of michigan , and midway through tonight s 400meter individual medley at the summer olympics , it became clear that tom dolan and eric namesnik would decide the united states' first gold medal between them in women s swimming , costa rica won its first olympic gold medal ever and south africa won its first olympic event in 44 years , while the chinese continued their mysterious swoon but there would be no collapse by either dolan or namesnik midway through the men s 400 individual medley , they were locked in a dead heat after 350 meters , namesnik held a lead of threehundredths of a second but dolan , 20 , of arlington , va , propelled himself out of the final turn , fought off an attack of exerciseinduced asthma and overtook namesnik on the final leg of the freestyle stroke , touching the wall first in 4 minutes 1490 seconds it was nowhere near his world record of 4 1230 , but it was more than sufficient for a gold medal namesnik , who won a silver medal in the 400 individual medley at the 1992 summer games , had to settle for second place again tonight in 4 1525 curtis myden of canada won the bronze medal in 4 1628 the americans won a second gold medal tonight when the 4x200meter relay team of josh davis , joe hudepohl , brad schumacher and ryan berube took first place in 7 1484 sweden took the silver and germany the bronze in the women s 100meter breaststroke , penny heyns , 21 , a south african who has competed the past three years at the university of nebraska , broke her own world record in the morning in tonight s final , she won south africa s first gold medal in any sport since 1952 the country was banned from the summer games from 1964 through 1988 because of the racial policies of apartheid heyns , whose winning time was 1 0773 , swam 1 0702 in the preliminary , breaking her own fourmonthold world record of 1 0746 amanda beard , 14 , of irvine , calif , languished in seventh place at the turn but recovered to take the silver in 1 0809 samantha riley of australia won the bronze in 1 0918 claudia poll won costa rica s first gold medal in any sport , defeating the world recordholder franziska van almsick of germany in the 200meter freestyle in 1 5816 van almsick took the silver medal in 1 5857 , and dagmar hase of germany won the bronze in 1 5956 poll s sister , silvia , won a silver medal in the 200 freestyle at the 1988 summer games china failed to advance any of its four female entrants to tonight s finals le jingyi won the 100meter freestyle on saturday , but none of china s other women has made it out of the preliminary rounds this is a stunning turnaround from the 1994 world championships , where china s women won 12 of 16 possible gold medals a doping scandal followed , which resulted in increasingly vigilant drug testing this appears to have resulted in slower times at the olympics , american coaches believe i think this is the first olympics in 20 years where the playing field is becoming level , coach jon urbanchek said , referring to the systematic use of drugs by swimmers from the former east germany there are a few individual cases , but there is no systematic use of steroids , according to the results urbanchek is best known as the coach of dolan and namesnik at the university of michigan dolan is a senior at michigan the silver medalist namesnik , 25 , graduated in 1993 the swimmers train together , but they are not close they have been known to come out the pool screaming at each other admittedly , they are polar opposites dolan is from a wealthy family in the washington suburbs his father , bill , was a candidate for attorney general of virginia in 1993 namesnik is from a pennsylvania steel town called butler , and he is the son of a steelworker he is quiet and reserved , while dolan is a generation x poster boy who likes loud rap music dolan has given up his final year of swimming eligibility at michigan to sign an endorsement contract with nike he has been featured in many preolympic newspaper and magazine stories , while namesnik trains in an anonymity relieved only during the brief period of the games my goal was to win the gold medal , namesnik said everyone tells me i'm second fiddle all the time distracted as water began to infiltrate one of his goggles and affect a contact lens , dolan finished third in the morning qualifying heats of the 400 individual medley , while namesnik took first place the race comprises swimming s four strokes the butterfly , the backstroke , the breaststroke and the freestyle after the backstroke portion tonight , the two swimmers were even at 2 0287 i definitely do n't think either of us would be in the place we are without having each other in the pool , dolan said it s been great i 've learned from eric any time you have a relationship like that , you 're going to have some rough edges , under the conditions we 've had , with the pressure we 're under , i think we 've handled it real well it s been an ideal situation for both of us namesnik agreed we 're supposed to have this big rivalry , he said when you have two of the top swimmers in a particular event , it s difficult not to have a little stress the 6foot6inch dolan pulled ahead slightly in the third stroke , the breaststroke , but namesnik regained the lead and was tenuously in front with 100 meters of freestyle swimming remaining the crowd of about 14 , 000 at the georgia tech aquatic center was delirious with the realization that an american was certain to win a gold medal dolan drew ahead after the final turn , his finishing kick being stronger he held the lead to the wall and touched just ahead of namesnik , who was left disappointed by another secondplace finish dolan has become america s top swimmer despite a congenitally narrow windpipe , which narrows his oxygen flow up to 20 percent , and exerciseinduced asthma , which can make breathing even more difficult several times , dolan has passed out during training sessions tonight , he said his breathing began to feel claustrophobic and constrictive and that his legs began to burn with lactic acid on the final turn toward home i really could n't get any oxygen at all , he said but i knew there was 50 meters to go to get a gold medal that s all there was to it now that their olympic showdown is over , namesnik said he hoped he could become closer to dolan he wants to be an assistant coach next season at michigan , where dolan will continue train while he attends classes i will be standing on the pool deck telling him what to do , hopefully , instead of getting told what to do , namesnik said dolan gave him a look that seemed to say , yeah , right once a rival , always a rival photos he s no 1 tom dolan became the first american to win a goldmedal at the atlanta games he won the 400meter individual medley \( jose r lopez the new york

proposed standards for teaching history to american schoolchildren , which came under furious attack from conservatives when they were published last year , are being reissued today in a revised form that omits their most criticized feature the examples of classroom activities with the old version condemned as giving short shrift to figures and events that have traditionally been emphasized , the new version adds material like a more detailed treatment of the declaration of independence and the role of george washington , and a continuing emphasis on the role of science , mathematics , medicine and technology it adds a consideration of the motivation for migration to north america from europe in the colonial era , and incorporates specific acknowledgments of the positive aspects of agricultural and industrial modernization here and there , wording that some found objectionable has been omitted students are no longer asked to evaluate why the republican party abandoned africanamericans in the south during reconstruction instead , they are asked to analyze how shared values of the north and south limited support for social and racial democratization the new standards , which are the product of months of review and study by historians and teachers , are being issued by the national center for history in the schools at the university of california at los angeles they combine into one volume the standards for united states and world history from kindergarten through high school , originally published in three separate volumes the teaching examples will be published separately next summer as classroom aids , without the stamp of being national standards christopher t cross , president of the council for basic education , a national nonprofit group that promotes the teaching of basic subjects , praised the revised standards yesterday as an excellent blueprint for coverage of material in us and world history the council , with financing from the pew charitable trust , the john d and catherine t macarthur foundation , the ford foundation and the spencer foundation commissioned two independent panels of historians , teachers and school administrators last june to study the standards many of the changes they proposed have been taken into account in the new version the council recommended dispensing with the teaching examples that had been the target of much of the criticism in doing so , it recognized that many of the examples were excellent , like one inviting high school students analyze within its historical context the decision to use the atomic bomb on japan , taking into account the allied military position in the pacific in 1945 , estimated military and civilian casualties in a prolonged war , longterm consequences as understood in 1945 , japanese surrender overtures and the probability of soviet entry into the war but now and then , students would be invited to make facile moral judgments , it said , citing a classroom teaching example that suggested that students conduct a trial of john d rockefeller on a charge of participating in unethical and amoral business practices designed to undermine fair competition the standards had come under the harshest attack from lynne cheney , chairwoman of the national endowment for the humanities in the reagan and bush administrations , who said the american history standards presented a warped view , ignoring the nation s white , male heroes she said the document contained 17 references to the ku klux klan and 19 to mccarthyism but none to paul revere or thomas a edison in appraising the history standards , the independent panels told the council on basic education that dispensing with the teaching examples would eliminate many of the problems related to the absence or presence of individual names , since the standards themselves name relatively few historical figures the teaching of history within the general frame proposed by the standards will necessarily include examples of individuals with varying degrees of influence on the events of their own time , the panels noted but it is not the job of the standards to provide a list the council said states , districts , professional organizations and others should develop examples for teachers as a separate supplement to revised history standards there will always be conflicting interpretations about the meaning of history , it said in history , no historian , no book not even proposed national standards ever has the final word in the revised version of the standards , which set out voluntary goals for education but are not a curriculum , the first era of united states history has been expanded to include portuguese colonialization in the americas , consideration of slavery in africa in the 15th and 16th centuries and changes in western europe in the age of exploration , including dissent within the roman catholic church during colonization and settlement from 1585 to 1763 , the revised standards add that students first need to understand what induced hundreds of thousands of free and indentured immigrants to leave their homelands in many parts of europe why did they risk the hardships of resettlement overseas , and how well did they succeed \? and in the period from 1754 to the 1820 s , the standards have said from the first that the american revolution is of signal importance , but the revised version spells it out in thinking about the causes and course of the revolution , it is important to study the fundamental principles of the declaration of independence gary b nash , codirector of the history standards project , said yesterday that he was pleased by the additions to the standards i do think the standards are improved , mr nash said they 've added material that s important he went on to add that more than 32 , 000 teachers had bought the original version , at 1895 for each paperback copy , and that i still have n't had any requests for sending their money back joyce appleby , a professor of history at ucla and presidentelect of the american historical association , said yesterday my impression , from talking to teachers , is that they 're dying of thirst for some guidance and some knowledge of the scholarship of the last 20 or 30 years which has enriched our understanding this needs to get into the classroom ms appleby said she viewed the revised standards as an improvement , but added i was very pleased with the original one lynne cheney is not a professional historian you could n't name more than five historians who would criticize them
florida democrats hope to reverse a trend no democratic presidential candidate has carried florida since jimmy carter in 1976 , but the state is considered very much in play this year , in part because of 3 million in television advertising by the democratic party since last october in the last three months alone , the national democratic party has passed 16 million to the state party to pay for television advertising , campaign expenditure reports show scott falmlen , executive director of the florida democratic party , said the level of expenditures was indicative of the clinton campaign s interest , and predicted lots and lots of resources would be put into florida until recently , the dole campaign and the republicans have had little response on the state s airwaves tom slade , chairman of the florida republican party , said he had been on bended knee trying to convince national party officials that the state cannot be taken for granted still , last week the republicans began an advertising campaign in florida that accuses mr clinton of supporting the largest tax increase in history and neglecting the federal budget deficit washington horton ad figure is dole delegate floyd brown , the independent conservative operative responsible for the willie horton advertisement in 1988 and the gennifer flowers callin line in 1992 , is back for the 1996 campaign this time , mr brown will be on the inside , as a bob dole delegate to the republican national convention and a member of its platform committee mr brown said he had worked hard to win a spot as a delegate from washington state so he could go to san diego as an inside player now i'm going to have a little more impact , he said in an interview that prospect drew some scathing fire from the washington state democratic party it s incredible that the republican party would appoint their master sleaze peddler , the man who created the racist and divisive willie horton ad , to develop policy issues , said a democratic spokeswoman , jenny holladay mr brown , who is also the host of a conservative talk radio show , is perhaps best known for his 1988 independent attack advertisement against the democratic presidential candidate , gov michael s dukakis of massachusetts , about mr horton , a black convicted murderer who escaped from prison in massachusetts while on a weekend furlough during the dukakis administration while he was at large mr horton attacked a white couple , raping a maryland woman and stabbing her fiance the advertisement was disavowed by the bush campaign mr brown also set up a pay telephone line in 1992 featuring the tapes that ms flowers said had been made from her telephone conversations with mr clinton louisiana 2 democrats lead in poll for senate a new poll suggests that louisiana s senate race may turn into yet another example of how strange political institutions breed strange politics the institution is louisiana s open primary , in which candidates of both parties run together , and if none gets more than 50 percent , the top two finishers go on to a runoff the poll , by southern media and opinion research , indicates that the top two finishers at the moment are democrats mary landrieu , the former state treasurer and 1995 gubernatorial candidate , and richard ieyoub , the attorney general the problem for the republicans is the crowded field none of the six republican candidates , including representative jimmy hayes , broke into the double digits of support in the poll with such a split republican field , there s an opportunity for the democrats to finish one , two , said john maginnis , a longtime analyst of louisiana politics the election in louisiana is sept 21 , the runoff nov 5 the race is for the seat now held by senator bennett johnston , a democrat , who is retiring this seat was once considered a prime pickup opportunity for the republicans , but an independent congressional analyst , charles cook , recently classified it as leaning democratic robin toner  the regions polls reflect mixed loyalties for months , democrats have had a fairly consistent edge in national polls when voters are asked whether they plan to vote for a democratic or republican candidate for congress but the national polls mask some important regional differences in the battle for the house , in which a shift of 20 seats would cost the republicans the majority in the most recent new york times cbs news poll , the democrats have an 18point edge in the northeast and a 5point edge in the midwest but republicans have a 5point margins in the south and west what does this mean \? it underscores the vulnerability of republican incumbents in the northeast it also helps explain why the wave of democratic retirements in the south is such a headache for the democrats holding onto an open seat in such republican terrain will not be easy california , with a decidedly democratic tilt in most recent polls , is a special case in the west , but much of the rocky mountain region retains its fealty for the republicans and the midwest may turn out to be the decisive battleground , with its concentration of republican freshmen bill mcinturff , a republican pollster , said these regional variations might have another implication because so much of the pressandpundit class lives in the northeast , he said , they may have a skewed perspective on the democrats' chances for victory in the house races if you lived in birmingham , he said , your perception of the race for congress would be quite different photos mary landrieu , one of two democrats leading the field inlouisiana \( slick lawson for the new york times \) floyd brown , who was responsible for the willie horton advertisement , will be a bob dole delegate to the republican national convention \( kirsten bremmer for the new york times \)

to drive the 120 miles from brooklyn to montauk , the length of long island , is in a strange sort of way like crossing the continent it is a journey that begins in the great city , moves on and on through what can seem like endless stretches of different landscapes , then culminates in a place of great beauty where the land runs out at the edge of the sea now it is not exactly like crossing the country , of course there is no continental divide , since it is something of a stretch to conceive of the pine barrens as being nature s break between east and west , and obviously it takes somewhat less time to traverse long island than the american continent , although on certain friday afternoons in the summer it is reasonable to think otherwise but this metaphor is more a matter of state of mind than of any tangible facts about the landscape after all , the hamptons really do feel more and more like california all the time , and the island , like the country at large , is forever being crossed by people who have business at either end , and pay scant attention to what is in between yet what is in between is what truly validates the metaphor , for it is the american postwar world , more fully realized here than anywhere else long island between the city and the east end is the archetypical american landscape , the quintessential expression of all its banal madness , all its boredom , liveliness and strange , humming kind of energy road after road , strip mall after strip mall , a land governed by automobiles and the kind of buildings that are made to accommodate to them the island has never been as industrialized as new jersey , and with the exception of certain parts of the north shore it has never been as genteel as connecticut until the 1950 s , long island was mostly small towns and farmland , ready and waiting for sprawl sprawl is what it got from queens to the middle of suffolk county , a place that looks like most american places , only more so here is where we see , as clearly as anywhere in the country , precisely what the american landscape will turn into if it is allowed to develop more or less by itself some of it is vulgar , some of it is beautiful , and nearly all of it is compelling it is a kind of badly compromised version of frank lloyd wright s broadacre city , that design from the 1930 s in which wright , perhaps the only great modern architect who understood the profound effect the automobile would have on the landscape , tried to preempt chaos by prescribing an ordered mix of housing , roads , commercial buildings and farmland long island is not the broadacre city of wright s imagination but the real one , twisted and contorted by the realities of the marketplace and dozens of different municipal jurisdictions so that it seems , to the casual observer , to be less a vision of suburban order than one of anarchy yet there is an order to the island , and if it is not easy to see , it is very much there , and its effect is vast cityscapes do not take their form for no reason at all , and that of long island is no exception a raw , blunt sense to the sunrise there is not much beauty to the sunrise highway , but there is a certain raw , blunt sense to it low , sprawling buildings with big signs that can be read instantly from a moving car lots of arrows telling you where to go , where to turn , when to get onto the service road and when to get off , everything designed to keep the traffic flowing and to ease the movement out of cars and into waldbaum s or mcdonald s or whatever the green arrow indicating a protected left turn may not be one of the noblest inventions of man , but it is all part of the system that , until it was burdened by a volume of traffic it simply could not take , actually made a certain sense that is all a kind of hidden order , a rational underbelly that makes the insipid sprawl , if not easier to take , at least easier to understand there is another kind of order to the physical form of long island , a more visible one the island has two great systems of transportation infrastructure the long island railroad , built gradually starting in the 1830 s , and the parkway and expressway system , built largely by robert moses from the late 1920 s to the 1950 s its form is affected by its two great natural resources as well the waterfronts of the atlantic ocean on the south shore and long island sound on the north , and then by the remarkable system of public parks , also virtually all the product of robert moses' career , built from the late 1920 s through the 1930 s the story of long island s physical form over the last 75 years is very much the story of robert moses , who treated the island as something of a private fief in which to experiment with public works on a grand scale taken together , moses' projects gave long island a set of resources that few areas anywhere have ever had , and they made it a kind of laboratory of american mid20thcentury suburban development long island is where , thanks to moses , the metropolitan region did the most to accommodate itself to the automobile , and did it the soonest and long island is where , thanks to moses , the metropolitan region began to understand the notion that the public realm had to extend beyond urban parks and boulevards , and had to include great rural parks , parkways and public beaches as well
a relative handful of engineers at new jersey transit , metronorth commuter railroad and the long island rail road account for about half the violations of several major trainoperating rules , a review of disciplinary records shows , yet the railroads almost never dismiss or demote the engineers in that small group and railroad officials acknowledge that many of the engineers who account for the bulk of the safety violations are under no greater scrutiny than their colleagues with flawless records engineers who violate serious safety rules are watched more closely , but only for a limited time the records were obtained by the new york times under new jersey s right to know law and new york s freedom of information law in the wake of the feb 9 fatal crash of two new jersey transit trains , which federal investigators believe was caused by an engineer s error the records could not be compared until recently because new jersey transit did not fully comply with the request for records for more than four months the three railroads' handling of engineer discipline is not unusual in the industry , and officials at all three commuter lines note that they are more vigilant in monitoring and punishing engineers than federal law requires more severe measures , they assert , are not needed discipline is supposed to be corrective , not punitive , said james j dermody , chief transportation officer of the lirr i'm still very confident that we 're safe but railsafety experts point to the disciplinary records as evidence that the three railroads and the entire industry could significantly reduce the risk of accidents by taking two steps closely monitoring over many years engineers with worsethanaverage records , and dismissing or reassigning the worst of them by any measure , riding the rails is quite safe , and all three of the region s commuter lines have betterthanaverage safety records except for instances of trains hitting people on foot or cars at grade crossings , accidents are few , and most do not result in death or injury but critics of the industry say that it is precisely because the risk is low that railroads are complacent and unwilling to deal firmly with problem engineers and the engineers' union says it would oppose any measures that would result in more dismissals officials of the national transportation safety board declined to be interviewed for this article but bill fletcher , a former chief of rail safety at the board , said if getting rid of a few guys gets rid of a lot of problems , it s worth it otherwise , it s like carrying a loaded gun in your pocket sooner or later , it goes off by that standard , one of those who might have been weeded out was john j decurtis , a new jersey transit engineer who has been a focus of an investigation into the february collision mr decurtis , the records show , had one of the worst safety records among engineers at the three railroads he was a few minutes away from finishing a long overnight shift on the morning of feb 9 when , at 8 40 am , his train collided with another in the marshland of jersey city mr decurtis , alfonso debonis , the engineer of the other train , and a david stern , a passenger aboard mr decurtis s train , were killed , and 162 other riders were injured federal investigators believe that moments before the crash , mr decurtis ran a red light , which he had been cited for doing twice before william r knapp , new jersey transit s deputy general manager for transportation , would not discuss mr decurtis s record or the accident , but he and officials of the other two commuter lines cited statistics showing that they are safe last year , new jersey transit averaged fewer than one accident per million miles traveled , the lowest rate by an american railroad running a red light , generally considered the most serious safety violation , occurs just 10 to 15 times a year at the three railroads combined but , mr fletcher asserted , a railroad s goal should be to make serious accidents even less likely , not merely to count them and compare the number with other railroads the best way to reduce the risk , he said , may be to crack down on problem engineers the violations safety record with many blots mr decurtis had been cited twice , in 1986 and 1989 , for running through stop signals he was also cited in 1983 for a derailment , and in 1987 for failing to make a scheduled station stop he should have been gone , said william c pugh , a former safety board trainaccident investigator who is a consultant on rail safety that s quite a bad record but an official of the engineers' union insisted that merely counting infractions was an imperfect way of measuring performance did he work a tough shift , a fatiguing shift , an irregular shift \? said joseph a cassidy jr , the international vice president of the brotherhood of locomotive engineers were there extenuating circumstances when he had those problems \? without that information , i look askance at the idea that this is someone who definitively should not be in a safetysensitive position
to the editor in her review of john pearson s painfully rich the outrageous fortune and misfortunes of the heirs of j paul getty \( dec 10 \) , diana b henriques makes an error that gives support to her own bias ms henriques states that the heirs were the victims of their own hunger for that money , and their craven fear that it would somehow elude them if ms henriques got as far as page 49 in this book , she would have read that the getty inheritance was settled on the heirs in an irrevocable trust as long ago as 1934 , and that there was nothing the founder trustee , j paul getty , could have done inter vivos or by testamentary disposition that would have changed that none of the heirs had any fears on that score , craven or otherwise claus von bulow london
