my older son , gabriel , is in his room , propped up on elbows over a copy of ripley s believe it or not ! hey mom , want to see a picture of the man with fireproof skin \? i sit beside him and peer at the photo of a man who holds a torch to his body with no apparent repercussions awesome next , he shows me the smiling woman , arms knotted behind her back then another who writes her name with both hands simultaneously upside down and backwards wow like many 10yearolds , mine is fascinated by the amazing , strange , inexplicable , weird and all true found within these 500 pages who can blame him \? different is interesting different is cool but different can also be deeply troubling when it s happening to you last year , i had to label my son md \( multiply disabled \) , a broad classification for children with a combination of learning problems most recently , we changed the label to something beginning with the letter a the hardest thing i 'd ever done what is a , you wonder \? attention deficit disorder \? anxiety \? autism \? can we hold off a moment , please \? there s so much more to tell last march , the big yellow school bus stopped coming by our house instead , a small van now takes my boy off to a special school everything is different now so much is better the labeling game is a tricky one like any good parent , i wanted no part of it i intended to emphasize my child s strengths , not spend years studying his problems and repeating them over and over again to teachers , therapists and lawyers in order to get help years ago , i developed my own labels to explain my son s uniqueness gifted , scientist , voracious reader , dry wit , outoftheboxthinker , shy , creativeprobablyanartist and kind older brother but none of these labels could explain why such a bright child could not survive in a public school why , in kindergarten , he was alone at lunch why , in first grade , it seemed he was writing with paws rather than hands why , in second grade , he could not pay attention why , by third grade , he developed insomnia , became nauseous each morning , and said he would rather die than go to school and why , by fourth grade , he looked me in the eye one morning and said , teeth gritted , i am not going the only way to get him up would have been with a crane now that the van comes each day , we 've had an astonishing turnaround he calmly goes out the door , like , well , a norma i mean , a typical child he attends a class with 12 students , receives motivating points for good behavior , has successes and is accepted and respected for who he is suddenly , we are all feeling hopeful and whole again the label which i once feared and despised may have saved our lives of course , lots of people are skeptical about all these learning disabilities that have suddenly beset our society where did all this dyslexia , and add , and autism come from \? we did n't have all this stuff back then we turned out all right i'm not so sure what about the alcoholics , the chronically unemployed , the angry antisocial loners of the past \? what was at the root of their problems \? new developments in neuroscience and brain imaging now reveal that learning disabilities are not a fad , not an excuse , not a reflection of baby boomers' obsession with their children but the result of brain wiring that is different from typical brains sure , it s good to be skeptical about labels plenty of children with academic troubles do n't require classification , and most do n't need special schools diagnoses can be baffling and imprecise doctors do n't always agree \( ours sure did n't at first \) , and symptoms may be nebulous some fit , others do not like many children with learning difficulties , our son has a plateful of overlapping challenges it s hard to know which one is in charge some days , my guy does n't look like he has any of the a s but once we got a decent diagnosis \( one that fit at least most of the time \) , we began to cope we found the right people to help , and other parents who understood perhaps , most important , we began to forgive our son will have to work harder we 'll all have to work harder but we understand now that he is not lazy or naturally defiant , and his path will be unique in his book the misunderstood child , dr larry b silver , a clinical professor of psychiatry at georgetown , poignantly describes his own tortured experience having learning disabilities and writes that at least 10 percent of schoolage children have them our own psychiatrist makes a larger estimate he says , listen , there s a 50 percent chance you 'll get at least a little bit of something here he s talking about the whole gamut of psychiatric quirks , conditions and syndromes , not all of which even merit treatment but the idea is a comfort sort of like ripley s busting open our ideas of normal to a bigger and more accepting place complain if you wish about video games and the stresses of our modern world this is one area where we as a society are improving as we accept the big variety of human life gabriel , what do you think of the term 'learning difference' \? i think it s fair , he replies it s better than learning disabilities i hate that term it makes you sound like you 're mentally ill or something what do you think of the term asperger s syndrome \? i ask cautiouslyfor yes , this is his label , a neurobiological condition at the highfunctioning end of the autism spectrum symptoms range in intensity but include social difficulties , developmental delays , some quirky behaviors and , sometimes , great talents \( parents love to tell you that einstein and mozart probably had it , too \) you say i have this , he replies but i really have no idea what it means then he adds you know , it would have been much easier not to have all this i know i'm different but i do n't feel different at all , really it s just like i'm me most of the time i just try to act like normal do you mean typical \? ok , typical i try to act typical i only want to pay attention to my learning difference when i have to i ask for the twentieth time how he likes his new school i like it , he replies calmly and maturely i feel better i see that mine is n't the only problem some kids have it worse some have it better and , mom , you 've asked me enough now really , you do n't need to ask me again i do like it to tell you the truth , we 're feeling more typical each day yes , we 've got a lot ahead but it s time to give labels and worries a rest right now things are going well it s time to focus on the positives and his individuality , and the divine spark of how we never know where the future will lead no label can predict drawing \( drawing by alex nabaum \)

nearly five months after an october rainstorm badly flooded hundreds of houses in nassau county , many homeowners are still trying to find help to pay for repairs more than 1 , 200 homes in nassau county were damaged in flooding from eight consecutive days of rain through oct 14 , according to assessments by federal , state and local officials a total of 139 inches of rain fell on nassau county during that time , the national weather service said , with the worst flooding in the southwest corner of the five towns but residents have received no aid from county , state or federal relief agencies , and the damage to many homes was not covered by insurance some residents have filed claims against the county , and hearings have been scheduled mitch weiler of north woodmere called the flooding insane there was garbage and stuffed animals and clothing that had to be thrown out and was lined up on the street outside homes , mr weiler said because of the lack of financial help since , he said i think people feel violated a lot of people in this area may be able to afford to fix up their damage , but we still deserve help soon after the flooding , residents in nassau looked to the county for help the county went to the state , and the state to the federal government but the federal emergency management agency rejected the state s request that four counties , including nassau and suffolk , be declared disaster areas fema , ruling in december , said the state had the resources to take care of the damage and cleanup county officials plan to appeal the decision but say the forecast for relief seems dim estimates of damage to private property from residents of the four counties total 55 million , but fema said that damage to public property and infrastructure reported by the state was 127 million , well below the agency s 22 million threshold for getting aid we do n't seem to meet any of the thresholds , said estelle henenberg , a north woodmere resident whose high ranch house was flooded the henenbergs , like many affected families , had flood insurance , but their insurer denied their claim , saying basement damage was not covered that predicament was widespread terry winters , the director of planning for the nassau county office of emergency management , said that more than 90 percent of reported damage was to basements and that insurance companies rarely reimburse for basement flooding what made it worse is that many of the basements functioned more as bedrooms and offices than as the traditional cellar space stuffed with bicycles and power tools the henenbergs' 1 , 800squarefoot basement , for example , contained a guest bedroom , an office and a living area with walltowall carpet we had so much more than a simple basement down there , ms henenberg said little evidence remains of what ms henenberg called a nice , elegant space raw sewage flooded from the toilet and shower , so the basement had to be gutted , the carpet torn up , the furniture thrown out and the walls stripped down to the studs the toilet bowl in what used to be the guest room is filled with dried concrete after the henenbergs' gardener threw it into the toilet to try to stop the flooding mark mcalpin of acm waterproofing , who is helping to repair the basement , said the henenbergs' damages exceeded 60 , 000 none of it was covered by insurance some residents meticulously documented the damage to their houses this is our tour de force , ms henenberg said , holding up a picture of the toilet brimming with concrete mitch hymowitz , who also lives in north woodmere , had similar photos of damage at his house , but he said they were a sad substitute for the photographs he lost in the flooding i had photo albums in the library in my basement that had pictures from my children s bat mitzvahs , mr hymowitz said he said he did not understand how the water rose so quickly lorna goodman , the county attorney , called the storm a terrible fluke , and said the ensuing damage came from the amount of rain , not from any fault of the county given the volume of rain , peter gerbasi , the deputy county executive for parks and public works , said he thought the sewer and drainage systems had functioned well the sewers themselves did not overflow , and the treatment plant was operating at two times its regular capacity , he said nassau county has two separate drainage systems one for rain and stormwater and another for sewage and under normal conditions they never meet stormwater discharges into basins , while waste is funneled through pumping stations until it reaches a sewagetreatment plant \( the main plant is in wantagh \) but the october rains represented an aberration according to assessments by the public works department and by paul gressin , the owner of professional building inspectors in woodmere , the ground became so saturated that some rainwater seeped into sewage pipes , resulting in the overflowing toilets and showers experienced by some residents there were only isolated incidences of sewage overflow , mr gerbasi said the majority of the damage simply came from the groundwater rising at such dramatic rates these explanations , however logical , do not satisfy residents with flooded homes and no reimbursement some residents have suggested that the port authority of new york and new jersey , which operates kennedy international airport , closed floodgates to preserve the runways , leading to flooding of the southwest corner of the five towns the port authority did not respond to requests for comment , but county officials and mr gressin called the theory improbable there is no need for us to look further into it , said mr winters of the office of emergency management it did n't happen some residents questioned the capabilities of the drainage systems in their densely developed neighborhoods , and were suspicious of the rapid rise in water levels but the office of emergency management and the department of public works said that was simply a symptom of a system surrendering to overwhelming rains when you get into a lowlying area like the five village area , it is n't much above sea

as friday stretched into saturday , the yankees and the boston red sox slogged through the longest nineinning game in baseball history and that was only the half of it the teams played for 520 minutes at fenway park in a daynight doubleheader , and the yankees swept their rivals to take their largest division lead of the season with three more games to go over this long , long weekend , the yankees hold a three and a half game lead in the american league east the yankees won the first game , 124 , in a comparatively tidy 3 hours , 55 minutes they also took the nightcap , 1411 , in 4 hours , 45 minutes that broke by 18 minutes the previous major league record , set on oct 5 , 2001 , the night barry bonds of the san francisco giants broke the singleseason home run record in a game against the los angeles dodgers the yankees and red sox also have the record for the longest postseason game at 5 49 , set in game 5 of the 2004 american league championship series there were heroes all around for the yankees , especially reliever scott proctor , who worked both games he was needed in the second game after kyle farnsworth took a line drive off his right leg in the seventh inning \( xrays were negative \) johnny damon homered in both games and drove in seven runs over all bobby abreu was 6 for 9 with three walks in the doubleheader melky cabrera reached base five times in the night game , when derek jeter s threerun double in the seventh inning gave the yankees the lead for good the yankees played with a threeman bench , but what a bench it was in the second game with his team trailing in the seventh inning , 107 , manager joe torre called on jason giambi and jorge posada it turned the night around with one out against the rookie craig hansen , giambi came in to pinch hit and drew a walk bernie williams singled , and so did the pinchhitting posada mike timlin entered to face melky cabrera , who had a terrific game cabrera threw out a runner at the plate in the fifth for his leagueleading 12th assist at the plate , he took sophisticated atbats all night long against timlin , cabrera saw nine pitches , singling to right to drive in giambi after an out , derek jeter came up against timlin , a reliever he has named as the toughest for him to face before friday , timlin had held jeter to three singles in 20 atbats but jeter battled back from a 12 hole , lashing a threerun double to the right field corner to put the yankees ahead , 1110 the procession of smart atbats was a highlight amid the tedium , and by the time the inning was over , the yankees had seen 53 pitches , scored 7 runs and gone ahead by 1410 none of it should have been surprising , considering how the game started damon led off with a 10pitch atbat , signaling what the boston pitchers would have to endure all night the yankees quickly wore out lester , who threw a staggering 95 pitches to get just 11 outs he needed 41 pitches to make it through the second , when the yankees took a 51 lead it was gone soon enough , though , because starter sidney ponson had nothing ponson , who has been bruised repeatedly by the red sox in is career , allowed as many hits as outs \( nine \) even the error that tied the score at 55 was a hard hit , a sharp grounder by coco crisp that eluded first baseman craig wilson in the third when the fourth inning started with three singles , torre could take no more ron villone entered his fourth game in four days , and ponson seems to be headed for the waiver wire the yankees need fresh arms in the bullpen , and ponson , whose earned run average is 1047 , cannot pitch for a few days , anyway when ponson left , the yankees had given him another lead this one came in the top of the fourth , when damon snaked another homer near the pesky pole in the rightfield corner it was a tworun shot off lester that gave the yankees a 75 lead , and gave damon his 20th homer of the season , matching a career high in this game , though , a tworun lead in the fourth hardly mattered the red sox raced ahead in the fifth , when they smacked around a weary villone and a newcomer , brian bruney , to take a 107 lead bruney s presence showed the yankees' desperation they took every precaution for these games , squeezing bruney onto the team by placing monday s starter , cory lidle , on the bereavement list another reliever , t j beam , was added when infielder andy phillips strained a rib cage muscle jeff karstens , a class aaa righthander , left his last start after one inning , so he could be a bullpen option if ponson is cut the specter of jaret wright s short start thursday hovered over this game wright lasted just three innings in a 122 loss to the orioles , but at least the yankees flushed the aftertaste quickly we knew this was a big series , so i did n't think it would have any lingering effects , said jason giambi , who drove in three runs in the opener friday it was one of those games that was so bad , you do n't even think about it on friday morning , torre reminded the team not to let the loss carry over but the meeting was more about scouting reports , he said , and it must have heartened the yankees to hear about boston starter jason johnson and the shaky relievers who would follow damon led off that game with a triple to center and scored on jeter s single damon homered in the fifth and slid in center field to rob lex gonz \? z of a hit in the sixth it was a tour de force that sparked the yankees that s what we 've seen him do on the other side of the field for so many years , torre said he just rises to the occasion damon s catch was the last gasp for the red sox , who got to within 43 but never made a serious move they went 0 for 16 with runners in scoring position , including 0 for 11 against starter chienming wang \( 145 \) , who pitched six innings to take over the team lead in victories it was an odd game for wang , who is , statistically , the best groundball pitcher in the league of his 18 outs , just 6 were on grounders wang threw more sliders than usual , and torre said he thought he tried to be too fine with his pitches twice , wang intentionally walked manny ram \? z he battled , torre said he probably did n't have his best stuff , but i thought he hung tight and tough the game was tight , too , until the yankees scored eight runs over the last three innings for the red sox , the outburst was a chilling preview of things to come photos derek jeter after hitting a threerun double in the seventh inning last night to give the yankees an 1110 lead he was a combined 4

a german opposition party said monday that it would vote for a formal parliamentary investigation into allegations that the german intelligence service provided help to the united states during the invasion of iraq , which the government vehemently opposed an official of the free democratic party , which has 61 seats in parliament , said the party favored an investigation because the two other opposition parties , the leftist greens and the new left party , have already declared their support , the free democrats' decision seems to ensure a formal investigation germany s government , in which power is shared between the main leftofcenter and rightofcenter parties , has made vigorous efforts to head off an investigation , saying it could harm the functioning of germany s intelligence service and efforts under way to improve relations with the united states earlier the government had furnished a report on the allegation that two agents of the country s intelligence service were posted to iraq starting shortly before the american military mounted the invasion that report was released some 10 days ago , but some in the opposition criticized it as falling short of a full , detailed disclosure of what the government may have been doing behind the scenes to support american policy in a full parliamentary investigation , rare in germany , members of the parliament would very likely publicly interrogate former and current members of the government under oath in their comments on monday , leaders of the free democrats said they wanted to investigate the roles of figures like gerhard schr \? , the former chancellor joschka fischer , the former foreign minister and frankwalter steinmeier , the current foreign minister , who was mr schr \? s chief of staff at the time of the invasion the likelihood of a full parliamentary investigation promises to breathe new life into a political scandal that has ebbed and flowed in germany since january , when the german press first reported that german agents in iraq gave information to the united states during the war , including information in choosing targets for the air and land combat the government conceded that intelligence agents did operate in baghdad , but denied that they provided information about military targets the report to parliament issued last month acknowledged exchanges of intelligence with the united states , but said none of the information would have helped the united states in the combat after the government report appeared , new disclosures in the press including articles in the new york times , vehemently denied by the government , that germany provided the united states with iraq s secret plan for the defense of baghdad had the effect of intensifying the opposition s calls for an investigation this was not sufficient in our eyes , wolfgang gerhardt , the free democrats' parliamentary leader said in a telephone interview on monday , referring to the earlier government report it did not deliver the necessary information on the rendition of a german citizen , on cia flights and even not on the question of the political leadership in the former government our main question is not , 'what did the security service do \? ' our main question is , 'what was the aim of the former redgreen government to declare openly to be against the iraq invasion and to treat the work of the security service without political leadership \? ' the phrase redgreen denotes the former coalition government of social democrats and the green party

of all the ingredients in our cooking arsenal , sugar is surely among the most valuable nutritionally , of course , it s just about worthless it s also bad for your teeth and can make you fat over time none of that stops us from eating it just about daily thrice daily this time of year for many of us so here s one more sugary treat you can make your own nut brittle to do this you will need to caramelize sugar , so here is a quick primer over heat and with a little time , sugar melts and completely transforms , becoming less sweet when it recools it can be sticky , as in soft caramels , or hard brittle , in fact what scares many beginning cooks and even some experienced ones is that sometimes caramelized sugar burns or becomes irreparably lumpy a couple of tips can help you avoid these pitfalls \( and since sugar is so cheap , if it fails , you can try again you 're only investing a few minutes \) start with a heavy pan you want evenly distributed heat if you have never made caramel before , add a little water to the sugar , about a tablespoon per cup this slows the cooking process , which is a good thing once the sugar starts melting the action can be quick slowing it allows you to stir out lumps before they are too big or too numerous veterans and the brave will do without the water and without the stirring and just shake the pan occasionally to move the melted sugar off the bottom stirring dry sugar almost guarantees lumps and a load of caramel forming on the spoon , where it does you no good no matter which technique you use , when the mixture is uniformly bubbly and golden , it s done it wo n't burn immediately thereafter , especially if you lower the heat at that point , dump in the peanuts or other nuts i like a bit of salt , also , but that s optional having made the stuff , you will be tempted to eat it all but you do n't have to you can give it away then make another batch did i mention that sugar was addictive \? peanut brittle time about 20 minutes , plus cooling butter for greasing pan 2 cups sugar 2 cups roasted peanuts , salted or unsalted , or other nuts salt , if using unsalted peanuts \( optional \) 1 use a bit of butter to grease a baking sheet , preferably one with a low rim combine sugar and 2 tablespoons water in a heavy skillet and turn heat to medium stir until smooth , then cook , adjusting heat so that mixture bubbles steadily stir occasionally until mixture turns golden brown \( which it may do rather suddenly \) 2 stir in the peanuts and a large pinch of salt , if desired pour mixture onto greased baking sheet and spread out cool for about a halfhour , then break into pieces \( you can score brittle with a knife when it has solidified slightly but not yet turned hard that way , it will break into even squares \) store in a covered container for up to two weeks yield about 1 pound

homeowners still have options , but as of jan 1 , those looking to buy homeowner insurance in westchester , new york city or long island should scratch allstate off their lists last week a spokeswoman for the new york regional office , krista conte , confirmed the company would no longer write policies for standalone homes in the area for either its own brand of insurance , or its encompass brand , offered through independent agents our population is much more dense in the new york area , ms conte pointed out , and our homes are valued so much more that when you look at the cost of labor , as well as the effects of recent hurricanes like katrina and rita , there is certainly reason to evaluate the exposure that we have here from a consumer s perspective , she added , it means we 're trying to preserve the promises we 've made to our existing customers allstate now has 26 percent of the homeowner insurance market in southern new york , and those homeowners number about 450 , 000 ms conte also said the company would continue to write policies for cooperative apartments , condominiums and rental apartments but insurers' promises could become harder to keep if , as some experts predict , a major hurricane hits the northeastern united states in the near future ms conte said allstate recently consulted a number of hurricane forecasting models , including one released in early december by researchers at colorado state university these predicted greater hurricane frequency in 2006 and saw a stronger likelihood of a category 3 hurricane on the east coast the new york state department of insurance says it is not aware that any other insurer is planning to follow allstate s lead but some independent agents are wary none of our companies have told us they 're pulling out of the market , said gabriel bundschuh , a longtime scarsdalebased agent , but after a while some might start to wonder why they 're taking a risk that others are not last year s hurricane season , the worst on record , set a record for homeowners' insurance claims nationwide , according to the insurance information institute , a manhattanbased industry group it says new york now ranks below florida in terms of the total insured value of residential properties in coastal communities yet it is not as if westchester homeowners paid low rates while insurance institute data indicate a 25 percent rise nationally in the cost of insuring homes last year , mr bundschuh says westchester s premiums have risen 8 to 10 percent a year for the last three years he estimates that insurers have also been expanding the coverage they offer on westchester homeowners' insurance policies by 6 to 8 percent a year , to cover the high costs of rebuilding in the area the last hurricane to hit new york was gloria , a category 2 storm , in 1985 yet many insurers active in the region have long required coastal and long island homeowners to carry either a hurricane deductible or a windstorm deductible as part of their policies over the last five years , according to mr bundschuh , some insurers have started to add the deductibles to policies they sell to inland residents of westchester the deductibles are usually expressed as a percentage of the insured value of the home they indicate the amount that homeowners can expect to pay for stormrelated damages themselves before their insurance will kick in at st paul travelers , the windstorm deductible in westchester is payable only by homeowners living within 1 , 000 feet of the shore allstate , on the other hand , requires a 3 percent deductible from homeowners living inland and a 5 percent deductible from those living on the long island sound the only exempted homeowners are those living in very northerly or westerly parts of the county , like amawalk , jefferson valley , mohegan lake and certain parts of yonkers triggers for hurricane and windstorm deductibles vary widely at state farm , the deductible kicks in once the national weather service has designated a storm a category 1 , which has wind speeds of at least 74 miles an hour allstate institutes the deductible only for storms packing 100mph winds for at least a minute according to bill goff , a product manager for the new york region , that definition places a storm somewhere between a category 2 and a category 3 lately , some insurers have tried to generate support nationally for a federally financed insurance catastrophe fund some have also expressed concern that as large , solvent insurers pull out of certain homeowners' markets , undercapitalized companies may move in instead at the state department of insurance , wayne cotter , research director , played down such concerns , saying that new york has an elaborate process for screening the financial solvency of any new insurer still , the department announced plans last week for a public hearing next month to look at current conditions within the homeowners' insurance market there has just been a lot of talk lately among state legislators , as well as people in the industry because of allstate s decision , said michael barry , the department s director of public affairs we decided it was time to convene a public hearing photos gabriel bundschuh , a scarsdale agent , linked a sharp rise in westchester s premiums to an increase in hurricane damage an ossining auto repair shop

there is no pineapple on the pizza at conte s nor is there chicken , ham or pesto but a trip to this neighborhood pizza place is n't about fusion food or trends it s about tradition and thin , savory crust that might bubble up into a burned spot on the rim , crust that inspires cravings , crust that holds its shape beneath a cloak of spicy pepperoni and floppy strips of sweet roasted red peppers conte s is also about beer , since it seems to be the only stubbornly nonswanky place in princeton with a liquor license here that means cold bass and widmer and a couple of others on tap there are also five choices in wine , and glasses that are filled to the rim i was always taught and told not to fix anything if it s not broken , says ciro baldino , who took over the restaurant with his brother anthony when their uncle retired in 1982 they were joined by anthony s wife , angela , in 2004 there s only so much wine you can drink with pizza , and i think chianti goes great as for the notion of chicken as a pizza topper , mr baldino s reaction is a snort audible over the telephone you do n't put chicken on pizza , he said people do but i do n't it s like putting ice in cognac conte s is in a long , lowslung building fronting one of two main drags in town highmounted televisions are often tuned to sports beer advertisements and color photographs of amateur ball teams decorate the walls the floor is terrazzostyle tile dating to 1957 , when the restaurant moved into what was once a conte family home a tall bar with black stools separates the bartenders from those who wait , a crowd that can build to three layers deep after 6 pm on a friday lighting is dim the 100 or so chairs are standardissue banquetstyle , upholstered in the same black faux leather tabletops are laminate shaker jars of hot pepper flakes , powdered garlic , dried oregano and parmesan cluster next to the standardissue salt and pepper the server usually shows up with a cshaped rack that can hold two pizzas , melamine plates , a stack of paper napkins and flatware that is sturdy enough to cut a pizza crust but leaves a temporary impression in your hand in the process conte s is not fine dining but it is a wellloved niche and an equalizer , where you 're as likely to see a plumber , a potter or a university professor standing in line for a table the menu , if you must ask for one , is simple , except for the best pizza on the planet ! boast on the back that quotes an old magazine article about the restaurant there are sandwiches there s pasta \( never al dente \) with or without meatballs , which are unremarkable , or sausage the bread served before the pasta is white on the inside and not much darker on the outside , served with individually wrapped pats of salted butter skip all that in favor of the pizza small , medium or large , with toppings of anchovies , sausage , pepperoni , mushrooms , peppers , onions , garlic or olives and the strangely satisfying retro salads they are made up of four components iceberg lettuce , some in bitesize pieces and others in larger chunks , with the occasional core plentiful raw onion cut into thin rings two or three wedges of pinkish tomatoes and half a bowl of salad dressing the best bet is to order the salad , which is big enough for two , with the dressing on the side , either house vinaigrette or blue cheese as for pizza , limit the toppings to two or three to keep stress on the crust to a minimum then sit back and sip a beer or that chianti if it s not too crowded , the pizza will arrive in 15 minutes if it s crowded , waiting can be excruciating sometimes more than an hour for a table and about the same for the pizza if you 're not mentally prepared , it s best to go elsewhere and plan to come back another day the crust craving will be building conte s 339 witherspoon street princeton \( 609 \) 9218041 good the space big room with standardissue tables that can be moved together for big groups no high chairs or booster seats wheelchair access the crowd noisy and very casual abundant children friendly servers the bar long and tall , with seating for about 20 basic selection of beers , bottled and on tap , 350 or 4 wine is served by the glass only , five selections , 6 the bill large plain pizza , 12 large special pizza \( with seven ingredients plus anchovies on request \) , 1850 discover and american express cards not accepted what we like salad with blue cheese dressing or vinaigrette pizza , plain or with nearly any topping if you go the restaurant serves the same menu throughout the day monday to friday , 11 30 am to 10 30 pm saturday , 4 to 10 30 pm and sundays \( beginning dec 3 \) , noon to 9 pm reservations for lunch accepted until 5 pm , but none accepted for dinner ample parking in the lot behind the building reviewed nov 12 , 2006 photos specialty of the house at conte s , in princeton , pizza and beer are the chief attraction the restaurant also serves wine \( photographs by laura pedrick for the new york times \)
when it comes to garage sales , everyone has a strategy shop early for selection shop late for bargains bring a list or let serendipity prevail i'm from the undisciplined serendipity school , which means i have wasted a lot of money over the years i once bought a huge wooden toboggan , only to find that it turned up regularly on the local garage sale circuit buyers would ride it downhill once , realize they could not pull it back uphill and sell it the next summer we did the same but the garagesale fates have also bestowed upon me some of my favorite possessions a footstool with bull seye trim , a stately pair of saltandpepper shakers , an eerie print of a centuryold indoor swimming pool none of them are treasures of an antiques roadshow sort all of them make me smile this year , though , i resolved to take an entirely new approach to our townwide garage sale day i was not going to acquire things at all i was going to shop for stories two experiences inspired me the first was writing a book about a gold coin that sold at auction in 2002 for 76 million the coin was a beauty of surpassing rarity , but its real value was its singular history not the object itself , but the story attached to it the same is true , i came to understand , for most possessions , albeit on a completely different scale without a story , our things are just stuff the second was a box i found in the hallway of an estate sale i visited last winter the box was filled with a dozen completed needlepoint canvases i was heartbroken how could it be that no one cared to keep these reminders of the woman who had stitched them \? i 've never stopped wishing i had asked about her my garage sale quest was an apology to her i was n't asking for a 7 million saga , just some evidence of love here in sea cliff , garage sale day is a giddy affair of crowded sidewalks , overexcited children and dogs confused by exotic smells i joined the throng with a notebook instead of a wallet at my first stop i picked up a copy of tom swift and his electric locomotive by victor appleton , inscribed to bud from wylie , 12 23 28 to my disappointment , my neighbor had no idea who bud and wylie were , nor how the book had turned up at her house some things are just mysteries , she said very true , especially at garage sales farther along i paused at a box of 30yearold archie comic books i loved these things , the seller told me i 'd read them for hours me too , as i had just been telling my daughter i broke my own rule and bought one in another yard a pair of gray metal stools caught my eye they 're from a diner , the seller said i bought them for my son , who has a place in chinatown , but they 're pretty unwieldy to bring on the train i asked if she had been a regular at the diner no , i bought them from a dealer in southampton , she said that was a story , but not what i was looking for i heard endless explications of the usual garagesale themes children growing up , home redecoration , hobbies that did n't quite work out i feared tragedy at a friend s house when i spotted a collection of empty fish tanks for sale , but learned to my relief that the family turtle , a redeared slider , had outgrown a succession of tanks he was now living in a monstersized enclosure we picked it up at a garage sale , my friend said so we 're selling these the circle of life , garage salestyle in the shadow of a russian orthodox church i saw an enormous , beatup stainedglass portrait of a crusading knight on horseback with hallelujahs from the church drifting overhead , the seller told me that he had rescued the knight from the renovation of a hotel in midtown manhattan i sensed money , not love , had been his motive my quest continued i walked down a steep hill and came upon a smiling couple , sitting in matching beach chairs at the lip of the cleanest garage i have ever seen i marveled aloud we 're compulsive , the woman explained more than ever as we get older you think more \? her husband replied i think less their offerings were sparse but the banter was irresistible i picked up an old tennis racket , wooden , with a tiny head it was in immaculate shape it s a davis , 40 years old at least , he said these were real popular then did you play \? oh , yeah he kept talking , but i glanced at her her face seemed to glow with the memory of his playing tennis with this racket decades ago it was a talisman of their long marriage , an object that reflected contentment so powerfully that even a stranger could see it thanks , i said , carefully replacing the racket on the table i had my story
it is with great sorrow , and no small amount of embarrassment , that i must confess to some inadvertent errors , omissions and elisions in my bestselling memoir , a brief history of tim in the wake of the recent revelations about the work of j t leroy and james frey , it seems inevitable that some of my small mistakes will come to light , and so i feel dutybound to be upfront and honest with you plus , i hear that reporters have been sniffing around i feel that none of the slight liberties i took in writing my memoir really affect the overall work , but nonetheless , you should know a few things i am not , in fact , black nor am i , to the best of my knowledge , a woman anything in my book that suggests otherwise is the result of a typographical error that this error was compounded by my decision to pose for my author photo and bookstore appearances in drag and blackface is , i will acknowledge , unfortunate the portions of my book dealing with depressionera ireland are , i have been reliably informed , copied verbatim from frank mccourt s angela s ashes i can only conclude that i accidentally confused my manuscript with my notes for my memoir in which i copied large portions of other writers' works , just to see how they were structured in hindsight , the fact that i was born 40 years after the depression should have been a tipoff my parents are both alive any reference to my being orphaned at age 12 was meant to be strictly metaphorical furthermore , my parents and their lawyers would like it known that neither they , nor any other member of my family , ever beat and or had sex with me i thought it was clear that those parts of the book were meant as a joke \( that s what the emoticons were for \) in writing a narrative , it is sometimes necessary to compress or combine certain incidents for dramatic effect i did much the same thing in the chapter of my book dealing with my prison term , although in reverse in the interest of dramatic clarity , i expanded my 1993 arrest for jaywalking into a sevenyear stint in sing sing for manslaughter okay , it was n't so much a jaywalking arrest as a ticket fine , it was a stern warning happy now \? the death of my older brother , my ensuing severe depression and subsequent emotional breakthrough with the help of a caring psychotherapist did not happen to me , but rather to timothy hutton in the film ordinary people , which i saw at a very impressionable age , and which i could have sworn happened to me ditto for the part about accidentally hacking into norad and being saved from causing a global thermonuclear war , with an assist from dabney coleman that was wargames really , the fact that i could remember his name only as dabney coleman should have given me pause and , finally , since people are getting all factchecky on me , i should just confess that my life did not , in fact , shatter into a million little pieces i just went back and recounted it was six pieces consider it a rounding error
despite a strong protest by his relatives , the government buried what they said were the remains of nawab akbar khan bugti , the 79yearold tribal leader killed a week ago when the pakistan military brought down his hideout cave in southern baluchistan province , in his hometown of dera bugti none of mr bugti s relatives attended the statemanaged burial his sons and relatives had refused to go to dera bugti and instead asked the government to hand over the body in quetta , the provincial capital government officials refused , saying the body was fast decomposing on thursday , military officials said they unearthed the body of mr bugti , whose death had set off days of protests and rioting , from under a heavy boulder in the cave officials showed journalists his reading glasses and wristwatch they had no scratches salman masood \( nyt \)
correction appended i cannot understand why anyone watches the academy awards tv seems like a strange place these days even to get entertained , trapped as it is between nonsensical punditry \( never have so many talked so much about so little \) and imbecilic sleaze \( cable gives us porn without penetration or money shots , which is porn without the courage of its convictions \) but why watch an industry any industry give itself awards \? i have simply never fathomed why anyone would care who was voted the best fashion designer or who did the best art directing \? i know that these deluxe edition dvd s makes everyone a film scholar these days , but i still don t think most people except pedantic cineastes really care who the cinematographer was i am aware that most don t watch for the lesser awards but rather for those given for acting but these actors are commonplace these days one sees them on tv all the time , plugging their movies or gassing inarticulately about their spiritual growth or some such nonsense it is amazing that these people have become significant simply through the power of advertising when i was a kid , one didn t see movie stars like elizabeth taylor or robert ryan or charlton heston or paul newman on tv much , so watching the academy awards had the appeal of seeing these people somewhere special , other than in a movie it was also something like a reality show when people lost and were disappointed , it showed reality shows were rare on tv then now , i expect my neighbors in webster groves , mo , to be the next big stars on some show about life in a suburban town where , maybe , we all might experiment with homosexuality to see who really has a yen for it or maybe all of us will swap mates , houses , jobs and churches the last time i watched the oscars all the way through , in 1972 , marlon brando refused the award for best actor for the godfather and sent a woman named sacheen littlefeather to diss hollywood s treatment of indians that was the same year that diana ross was nominated for best actress for lady sings the blues i kept thinking that perhaps it was just me but diana ross s performance was the worst i had ever seen this side of a high school berry gordy tried to buy her the award but he ran out of money or time or both she didn t win some blacks said that it was racism , since liza minelli , who did win for playing sally bowles in cabaret , wasn t much better than ross she wasn t much better but she was better geez , does standing up for your ethnic group mean you have to defend utter mediocrity \? the show has gotten no better over the years mediocrities continue to win , the occasional rich , dumb activist speaks out about something in 2002 halle berry behaved as if her oscar liberated black people \( it has failed to even liberate her career \) but the big reason i don t watch the academy awards , aside from the fact that in my middle age i almost never go the movies anymore , is that it is an awards show most of the time when you win an award , it is not merit or talent that gains the day it is pure luck , absolute accident consider the literary award , which i know well i have won a few and served on a handful of literary juries you win because the jury couldn t agree on anything else or people weren t sure what they were voting on , or , fortunately , no one read your work while the others got read or the best part of yours got read and not the best parts of the others , or a friend bullied it through , or yours came up when it was the year to give it to a minority or yours came up in the year that giving something to a small , independent publisher was the ticket , or you re pretty old and never won , or you re so young that winning makes you seem like a wunderkind and the jury seems prescient \( that the wunderkinds may fade into oblivion is a great possibility \) none of it makes any sense or serves much any purpose when you win you feel as if you have been struck by lightning and burdened with the glow and when you slect somebody to win you feel as if you have been struck by a car and burdened by the wreckage and anyone who gets a puffedup ego because of it is absolutely insane or believes in fantasy more than he or she should people are the only animals that make promises , i have been told we are also the only animals that give awards that should tell you something correction an earlier version of this post contained three sentences about george c scott that have since been deleted in them , mr early speculated that mr scott refused his best actor oscar in 1970 for patton because he was upset about not winning the best supporting actor award for his role in the 1961 film , the hustler in fact , mr scott had declined his nomination for the hustler
today i made my first attempt to talk to an african stranger in yaounde , cameroon we had stopped in some wornout area called the mango tree neighborhood , and i saw some boys playing hackeysack with a banana a little girl was playing around them nick and naka were stretching their legs behind the car , so i walked over to the boys a va \? i called out a va , they replied in chorus then there was silence i looked around , thinking where s my french \? where s my sense of conversation \? i had no idea what to do next c est tout \? elle dit a va \? one guy asked then burst out laughing they all started laughing together je m appelle casey , i said comment tu tappelle \? je suis pauvre donnemoi l argent , the middle guy said oh , uh , j ai rien , i said , feeling really embarrassed at this point he pointed to my transmitter for my microphone and asked me what about it oh , c est une microphone blank looks je suis journaliste they all said , ahhhh and one asked me if i like beer by then it was time to go , so i scurried off to the car with a huge smile on my face i accomplished absolutely nothing , but i had tried that s a first step , right \? later in the day , i got my second chance to talk with locals , this time in the maternity ward of a small clinic smiling doctors greeted us , and i was anxious to plunge into a story but they quickly started rattling off french reproductive terms , none of which i knew accoucher allaiter in the middle of cameroon , you can t put people through altavista s webbased translator babelfish and get a translation i tried to move away from the doctors and asked some birth attendants crowded around a newborn what his name was his name \? they asked in french he doesn t have one then , for the second time today , a group of cameroonians laughed at me i ve been brushing up on my medical terms tonight , though , and tomorrow i m going to the clinics ready to really talk we didn t spend much time at the clinic tonight because it was already getting dark in cameroon , driving after dark is a big nono there s too much risk french translations a va how are you , also , in response , means good c est tous \? that s it \? elle dit a va \? she said how are you \? je m appelle casey my name is casey comment tu tappelle \? what is your name \? je suis pauvre i m poor donnemoi l argent give me some money j ai rien i have none accoucher deliver \( a baby \) allaiter breastfeed

you may have noticed that it was a banner year for chipmunks this spring brought forth torrents of the chubbycheeked rodents , scurrying up drainpipes , darting through stone walls , undermining shrubs , perennials and masonry with the brio of brooklyn s mightiest tunnel sandhogs the terrain around house and garden took on the perils of a prairie dog village , with anklespraining sinkholes every few feet for the first time , i saw chipmunks scampering higher than squirrels in the pin oaks , doing greedy reconnaissance on the bird feeders below this year s furry tide turned our middleaged beagle , maybelle , into a pup again she stalked , dug , yipped and pounced herself into tiptop physical form she has never caught a chipmunk in seven years of trying they dart between her legs and chatter tauntingly from just beyond the perimeter of her electric dog fence sheer numbers increased her odds of bagging one this season but suddenly , in early august , she gave up the chase heaving herself onto the sunny deck with a great sigh , she lay resigned , watching the wee marauders with the gimlet eye of a defeated old general surveying a superior ground force like maybelle , i despise those rats with racing stripes i had to humbly concede their invincibility two seasons back when the greedy fiends began decimating my beloved tomatoes , i tried everything 18 inches of chicken wire driven into the ground beneath the garden fence , scary rubber snakes , a portable radio tuned to hiphop and cunning garden sachets steeped in fox and coyote urine \( priced like chanel , by the ounce \) none of it worked given the varmints' predilection for pouncing on any tomato that displayed the merest blush of pink , i tried wrapping maturing orbs in pantyhose an exercise that had my husband thumbing through our hmo manual for an appropriate help line then , like maybelle , i simply gave it up i had my fistshaking scarlett o'hara moment as i scavenged a few bruised specimens amid the plundered vines and vowed , loudly and heavenward , an end to these outrages no more would i mourn the beefsteaks and early girls i 'd staked , cosseted , pinched and fertilized instead , i surrendered myself to beauty untamed , offhand , notoil , extravagant , inedible and utterly impractical pulchritude henceforth , the tomato patch would become a flower fest in making my main floral choice , i went biblical , harking unto that old faithful , matthew 6 consider the lilies of the field , how they grow they neither toil nor spin and yet i say to you that even solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these in short no work , all display nothing gives you more payback \( and less backache \) for the buck than a mesh bag of gnarled lily bulbs drop the ugly beginnings of a scarlet emperor asiatic , a stunning agrippa , some saucy twotoned kissmekates into the chill october earth and forget them until june , when the eyepopping show begins this july i stood amid the blooms proud and giddy , with some sherbethued bells tossing haughtily as high as my eye i filled our rooms with them , photographed their shapely parts with a lusty connoisseurship worthy of hef and having shed that pervasive , summerlong tomatoangst \( if it was n't the chipmunks , it was something else blossom end rot , tobacco mosaic wilt , worms \) , i was carefree , as befits the season where once i crept up on the garden the better to surprise brunching rodents i strolled in boldly , cheerfully , just to ogle and inhale early summer s monsoons left some of my beauties lying limp and rumpled like blowsy saloon girls blinking in the sunday morning sun i sighed , straightened and staked the survivors and headed to the hammock i had n't toiled for their short , pretty lives , nor would i mourn them better still , i took my blooming bounty on the road leaving a pair of cukes on a friend s doorstep is nice , but a shopping bag stuffed with stunning peachesandcream trumpets is a thrifty but extravagant beau geste a carpenter working on the house looked puzzled when i pressed an armload on him for his wife the next day he came back grinning forgot what a few flowers can do , i guess flower power is more than a 1960 s clich \?

this will come as a jolt to all new yorkers currently giddy over the prospect of a subway series not a lot of people out there care about the fabled transfer at grand central station yes , the yankees are a national institution , as demonstrated by the way television will show yankee games in prime time , but a subway series \? that s our new york preoccupation , not necessarily shared by folks west of our mass transportation system for many baseball buffs , the best part of the postseason is confronting local jinxes , hexes and curses personally speaking , it was great fun to watch the angels , the red sox and the white sox all dismiss their ancient demons in 2002 , 2004 and 2005 new york , with its considerable selfesteem and local cable television money , has no similar ghosts to exorcise the mets may think they 're underdogs in life , but not with that payroll without pedro mart \? z , they may be underdogs to the yankees , but that s a different story the yankees never , ever qualify as an underdog , not with the immense luxury of alex rodriguez being dropped to sixth in tonight s lineup manager joe torre made it sound as if he had pulled the names out of his nyy cap , but even if torre made that move to take pressure off rodriguez , the yankees are loaded hideki matsui is hitting seventh , for goodness' sake the rest of the country does not really care if there is a lot of traffic on the irt , bmt and ind lines in the next four weeks it would have been compelling if the cubs had somehow qualified for this year s postseason they would have been worthy successors to the angels , the red sox and the white sox in facing ghastly public failures but whatever is ailing the cubbies is so profound , so institutional , that they were not going to win their first world series since 1908 baseball is going to have to look elsewhere for this october s story line there is nothing even close to the plot of 2002 , when the angels made up for epic collapses in 1982 and 1986 and won their first world series , with jackie autry accepting the championship trophy on the field in anaheim , in her husband s memory i do n't know if the rest of the country cared , but i felt downright sentimental at a haunted 42yearold franchise finally getting it right nobody in this year s hunt can approach the way the red sox won eight straight games to close out 2004 , beating ancient tormentors , the yankees and the cardinals , to win their first world series since 1918 , when babe ruth aw , but you know all that i 'd like to think even yankee fans could see the historic and human justice , but they probably did n't last year s sweep by the white sox was another slaying of mythic dragons , with the sox winning their first world series since 1917 , before the scandal of 1919 did the rush by ozzie guill \? s boys resound in philadelphia or seattle \? probably not america is still a pretty regional place , with fans only getting excited about the greatest little town in the world , meaning themselves and i include new yorkers in that generalization it s hard to get caught up in san diego s failure to win a world series since being formed in 1969 the padres have already lost two world series in convincing fashion they had their chances i do n't see any grand evil eye working against the padres , not even the disrespectful way the previous ballpark was renamed from jack murphy stadium , honoring a revered san diego journalist , to some geek corporate name that now escapes me that is hardly the stuff of the babe ruth or the black sox plagues the seven other teams in this postseason have all won at least one world series in recent times , going back to the cardinals in 1982 middleaged fans of those teams have had their fun still , there are local complexes to consider minnesota was almost rubbed out by threatened contraction oakland has perpetual smallmarket blues the tigers and the cardinals had the staggers in recent days the dodgers have n't been the dodgers since the o'malley family sold the franchise there are always issues meanwhile , we in new york have our own grandiose expectations the mets go into these periodic eclipses , but then emerge from the shadows , like brigadoon mets fans like to think their team will make up for its debacle against the yankees in 2000 last time they had timo perez this time they have jos \?

by game time , marcus jones is hard to find he is often up in the stands , one fan among thousands few know who he is , what he does or how much he has contributed to the success of a top10 basketball team recognition is nice , but the sophomore from perth amboy knew it was n't part of the deal when he agreed to join a group of fellow male students that practices several times a week against the rutgers women s basketball team his only role is to make the 12 women on the rutgers roster better players apparently , he is doing his job , because heading into this weekend , rutgers \( 143 over all , 60 in the big east \) was ranked 10th by the associated press to me , recognition is n't important , jones said what s important is that they asked me to do a job , which is to help them win he does that by performing like a testosteronefueled male in practice , playing a physical , fastpaced brand of basketball that rutgers coach c vivian stringer says few female players can duplicate she wants her players to be tested in practice , and that means bringing in a group of men , all of whom were good high school players but not quite talented enough or big enough to make it at the college level hundreds of other male players with similar skills are used to go up against women at colleges around the nation in a practice that is now the norm i want my players to practice against the best players possible , said stringer , who has been using male practice players since she arrived at rutgers in 1995 i want them to get involved in a physical style game and i want them to do the fundamental things a male could be 5foot3 and the female player could be 5foot8 still , the guy will have a greater muscle mass , will be quicker and stronger jones and the rest are allowed to throw their elbows , bang into opponents and do whatever it takes to win stringer s only rule is that the male players stay close to the ground she fears that an airborne player attempting a dunk or trying to block a shot could cause an injury , which is why she generally recruits men who are 63 or under the night before we started , i asked one of the coaches , 'how physical can we be \? ' jones said she said , 'just do n't break their noses or do something like that' then i stepped out on the court and it was like , 'oh , my god , these girls are physical they are tough' they start scoring on you and your pride takes over you think , 'i'm not letting that happen again' so what s it in it for jones or any of the other male practice players \? not much they are not paid and they do not get scholarships about the only perks they get are free tickets to the games and the sneakers and jerseys they wear in practice the female players and stringer s staff , the male players say , have done a good job making them feel as if they are a part of the team whenever stringer has players over to her house for a gettogether , the practice players are always invited jones wants to coach professionally some day and says he is getting a great education by being able to watch stringer and her staff michael derogatis , a senior who played briefly for division iii king s college in wilkesbarre , pa , believes that working as a volunteer for the basketball team will be a plus on his r \? m \? nd help him find a job upon graduation kyle humphrey and dante rsheed just enjoy playing matt javois , a sophomore from somerset , is hoping to make the men s team some day as is leo rishty , a freshman from eatontown who was captain of his high school team at hillel yeshiva i wanted to try out for the men s team this year , but i'm only a freshman , rishty said i need to work on my game and get stronger and get bigger hopefully , this will help and i can try out next year i went to a pretty small school we did n't have scouts come or anybody watching our games i picked a school close to home and hoped i could find a way to get better this helps me stay in shape and shows me where i need to improve mostly , though , practicing against female players is a selfless act that requires a lot of time and yields little reward i know my players appreciate them , stringer said we thank them every day i wish i could give them something more we 're not even allowed to take them on road trips i would give them money out of my own pocket if i was allowed to they 're certainly deserving everybody knows that , and goes out of their way to thank them and treat them well none of which means each side does n't want to trounce the other in practice usually , no one is keeping score the men often are asked to simulate the offensive and defensive routines of rutgers s next opponent , which does n't necessarily require them to outscore the women but sometimes they will engage in a battle of the sexes in fullcourt scrimmages that are meant to mimic game conditions during the first such scrimmage this season , the practice team won by 50 points , stringer said the female players have closed the gap since , and stringer says they may be able to win now because they know their plays and what is expected of them much better than they did early in the practice season they have not scrimmaged one another recently we want to blow them out , jones said i want to beat them by 20 , 30 points so much for chivalry , which has no place in a c vivian stringer practice these guys are very competitive , and when they go out there they do n't come out and play nice , she said i do n't need them to play nice photo plays like a boy kyle humphrey , a volunteer practice player for the rutgers women s team , drives between sammeika thrash , left , and tudy reed \( photo by keith meyers the new york times \)
the portable global positioning systems that drivers have been increasingly putting into their cars have become the new targets of thieves in westchester county police departments are reporting that there have been a wave of thefts of the units , which often cost 300 to 1 , 000 there has definitely been an increase , said lt robert koziak , of the mamaroneck police department , who said seven units had been stolen in town in the last few months we had seen none of these six months ago more than 20 gps units had been taken from cars parked in shopping centers in yonkers and greenburgh this year , but the pace of thefts slowed after the greenburgh police arrested two men in september when we arrested them , they had two gps units taken from cars parked along the central avenue corridor , one from near the yonkers border and the other from the white plains border , said capt joseph delio of the greenburgh police and westchester is not alone while the connecticut state police said they had not seen an increase in gps thefts , the police in new jersey have , although they said they believed the thefts were tied to one man in paramus , about 60 units were taken from shopping center parking lots earlier this year before the police arrested a queens man in may and charged him with burglary , theft and possession of stolen property he would break the window and look under the seat and grab the device , said capt kevin smith of the paramus police department he told us he got 75 to 100 per unit in the bronx in the four months since his arrest , we have had maybe four or five thefts the portable units that often attach to a windshield or sit on the dashboard , not the factory installed systems , are the ones primarily stolen by thieves , said detective sgt scott sullivan of the westchester county police department i liken this phenomenon with what we 've seen with airbags , xenon lights and certain radio systems , sergeant sullivan said it s a matter of where there is a market for these things so far this year , the units have also been stolen from cars parked at several train stations , including in white plains , new castle and croton falls , he said the number of portable units delivered to retailers has risen , according to steve koenig , a spokesman for the consumer electronics association this year , an estimated 23 million units are expected to be delivered , up from 700 , 000 last year manufacturers like garmin and magellan are encouraging their customers to remove the system , its mount and any mark left by the mount when they leave their car garmin also offers password protection on some models even if portable units have passwords , thieves may not get the word , said frank scafidi , a spokesman for the national insurance crime bureau , which specializes in auto theft and insurance fraud research most of these knuckleheads will think that they can plugandplay these in another vehicle , mr scafidi said we saw that same application with the headlight thefts that were occurring in the northeast a few years ago after manufacturers made it almost impossible to use the headlights unless you had the factoryinstalled wiring , they were still getting ripped off photos recovered detectives paul r fertig , left , and robert prescott of the greenburgh police department with gps units on display gps devices and tools used to get in cars \( photographs by alan zale for the new york times \)
if you don t give israel some advice this week , they revoke your pundit s license today , the reluctant hawks predominate washington post columnist richard cohen writes , the greatest mistake israel could make at the moment is to forget that israel itself is a mistake cohen elaborates , it is an honest mistake , a wellintentioned mistake , a mistake for which no one is culpable , but the idea of creating a nation of european jews in an area of arab muslims \( and some christians \) has produced a century of warfare and terrorism of the sort we are seeing now yet cohen also seems to suggest that there could be a mistake that s even greater than greatest israel could forget that many islamic leaders see israel not as a mistake but as a crime until they change their view , the longest war of the 20th century will persist deep into the 21st it is best for israel to hunker down should israel say thank you to hezbollah \? haaretz columnist yoel marcus writes we should be grateful to hezbollah for giving us this window of opportunity to launch an offensive that will change the rules of the game and break down the balance of fear created by hezbollah s menacing presence along our northern border all israeli governments have resigned themselves to hezbollah s extraterritorial standing as almost a state within a state , supported and stagemanaged by iran , which keeps it stocked with weapons and military instructors despite israel s withdrawal to the international border in full cooperation with the united nations , hezbollah s attacks have continued just don t be so grateful that you start a land war , marcus warns he concludes one can only hope that israel is not tempted at some point to send troops into lebanon to engage in land combat in a region where hezbollah has intimate knowledge of every nook and cranny we ve been in that mess before , and it ended badly neutralizing the time bomb known as hezbollah that sits on our border cannot be done without international involvement or mediation for this to happen , the battered home front must take a deep breath , and israel must keep up the military pressure until conditions are ripe for dismantling the ticking bomb for good the washington post editorial page hopes that israel isn t too eager to find a diplomatic solution and says that the only satisfactory outcome to the conflict would be a decisive defeat for iran and syria and their allies in hamas and hezbollah the newspaper editorializes , anyone who believes the israeli army can t be effective in this kind of war hasn t followed the events of the past several years , during which its devastating assassination campaign against hamas induced that group to declare a unilateral ceasefire in early 2005 war is not the worst option , the post suggests an international diplomatic initiative that allows hezbollah to preserve and eventually restock its military wing would be worse than none at all
no selborne journal today gilbert white returns tomorrow 6 am 52 degrees quiet , but the wind is coming let s see aconites are up in force first snowdrops appeared this morning the projectile points of irises and lily of the valley are just coming out of the ground a duck egg nearly every morning and every few days a goose egg as for chicken eggs , we get between 10 and 15 a day last night a thunderstorm this morning there was ground fog over the pasture , a light sky overhead but as i drank my coffee a thick sea of clouds came blowing in from the west , blotting out the light , leaving only a broad band of diffuse sunrise in the east the hemlocks outside my office went from green to black it was as though night had fallen in a rush , skidding across from the west yesterday the horses were out in the big pasture and in one of their moods no wind , nothing to alarm them except the freshening of their emotions when that happens ida begins to prance with tail erect , halfrearing , half bucking then she begins to streak around the pasture trying to stir the other horses up she succeeds soon remedy , who is nearly 30 , begins bucking and spinning , and even nell slips into a selfpossessed trot i walked across the pasture in the evening with the dogs i think that part of what the horses were feeling was the sudden give of the earth , the retreat of the frost the print of their hooves was everywhere , deep cuts and gouges where they pivoted over their forequarters or came up hard after a sprint it is worth trying to imagine what the feel of the earth tells a horse worth wondering how sentient those legs and feet really are meanwhile , i scraped out the corral with the backblade on the tractor a gratifying pile of muck and also the strange , almost embarrassing gratification of working with the tractor we have had it for 6 years now , and i ve put some 260 hours on it there were many mysteries on the farms i visited when i was growing up , but none were quite as forbidding as the mysteries parked in the machine sheds i watched my uncles and cousins on those tractors , and i could never quite get over the fact that they took them for granted i often rode along with them , which only deepened the mystery so many moving parts ! so many ways to get hurt ! brakes for each side of the tractor , throttles , pto levers , clutches , chokes , the heat of the manifold , and the exhaust column rising up ahead and now i take my tractor for granted too when i first began using it , it felt as though every motion i caused it to make was disconnected from every other motion now they all flow together as if the machine were halfanimate , which , of course , it is when i m on it the temperature has dropped 5 degrees while i ve been writing this here comes the wind

everybody in new york has a bitter divorce story , even if it s not personal we all know the friend who can pay either the lawyer or the rent battles over children become so brutal that they and their parents are left traumatized it can never be pleasant to end a marriage , but it does not have to be as awful and take as long as it does in new york state while most other states have some kind of onestep no fault divorce provision , new york still requires most couples to figure out who caused the marriage to fail under present law , a marriage cannot merely die it must be killed by one spouse or the other , through adultery , cruel and inhuman treatment , or abandonment even when none of these things have actually occurred , and even when both people agree on all the particulars this means , in effect , that people have to lie they have to go before a judge , swear to tell the truth and then not tell the truth those who deal with these issues day in and day out have concluded that pointing the finger at one spouse makes negotiations uglier , costlier and longer after two years of surveying new york s matrimonial law , a commission appointed by the state s chief judge , judith kaye , recommended last month overhauling divorce and child custody rules the centerpiece of those recommendations is onestep , nofault divorce that would make it easier for couples who want to end their marriages by mutual consent to do so in the past , with opposition from conservatives and the catholic church , some legislators in albany have resisted changes in a divorce law often said to be one of the strictest in the nation some women s groups have also resisted any changes , fearing that the vulnerable spouse , usually the woman , will fare poorly once nofault comes into being others have argued in favor of incremental change , like an adjustment a few years ago that allowed couples to get a divorce by mutual consent if they lived apart for a year and then filed for divorce an overly long and complicated process however , one important study for the national bureau of economic research has shown that in states with nofault divorce laws , where women can get out of a bad marriage more quickly , there were fewer suicides among women , less domestic violence and fewer women murdered by spouses the women s bar association , which earlier had opposed this shift , now endorses the nofault option for new york couples the legislature has yet to get very far on judge kaye s idea , but if this is going to bring relief to so many families , there is every reason for profamily politicians to help move it along this proposal will not eliminate the fullcourt divorce the kind that makes lawyers and tabloid newspapers so much richer and any new law should make it possible for spouses without financial means to have access to lawyers but right now , as judge kaye puts it , divorce takes too long and costs too much too much money , too much agony modernizing new york s divorce law will not be easy , but it is the right and humane thing for lawmakers to do
to the editor the first thing that caught my eye was the drawing accompanying the toxic lessons of a jersey childhood , thomas belton s sept 17 essay about growing up swimming in the hudson river off jersey city the color of the moon and its spillage was the same color of the odious liquid coming out of an exposed pipe from a factory nearby as i , too , as a child in the 50 s , swam with my siblings in the black water with the horrible bottom that sucked at your feet we had wonderful adventures motoring up the hudson river and around the statue of liberty we ate crabs , fish and eels caught in the river ignorance is bliss it was only when i grew up that i became concerned about what we must have been exposed to , and hope that somehow the experience had made us immune to toxins my childhood in the city has made me very concerned about protecting the environment i have raised three children in south jersey , where , i hope , they have been exposed to nothing more toxic than ticks they , too , are environmentally conscious because they want to preserve the relatively pristine pine barrens they grew up enjoying we do n't take anything for granted none of us should patricia klosek du brul southampton
two weeks after two purple hearts and a bronze star were found in a cos cob mailbox , there has been little progress in the search for the owner the medals are on display at the cos cob post office , which has received calls from people claiming that the medals belonged to them , but none could prove ownership the medals were found jan 20 by a cos cob postal employee in a mailbox in front of the post office they were found in a clear plastic baggie neither the baggie nor the medals had identifying marks bob vacca , the officer in charge at the post office , said he believed they were deposited sometime between noon and 3 30 pm that afternoon we 've had a couple of vague things , mr vacca said about the calls he had received about the medals one caller claimed a cousin may have lost the medals , while another believed a grandfather lost them another caller , from florida , speculated the medals may have been taken from a relative s vacant house i'm not going to just hand them over , he said the purple heart is awarded to soldiers wounded in combat , and the bronze star for heroic or meritorious achievement it is estimated there could be as many as 1 , 800 purple heart recipients still alive in connecticut , said burke ross , adjutant with chapter one of the military order of the purple heart mr ross wrote to mr vacca requesting that the medals be displayed at the connecticut veterans' home in rocky hill until the owner is found that would be the ideal place for them , mr ross said charley williams , the chief of staff of the connecticut department of veterans' affairs , said the veteran s home would be a good place to display the medals what better way to recognize the medals \? he said put them in a display case that warrants the dignity they deserve mr vacca said he was willing to display the medals a while longer in the hope that the owner can be found i'm going to let it go for a while , he said let s not be hasty about it but eventually , either an owner will have to be located or the medals moved elsewhere we do n't want to be in the middle of it he said postal employees are used to finding unusual things in mailboxes , including rolls of cash , bank deposit slips the sort of things that are accidentally slipped in with a handful of letters that kind of stuff happens , he said you 're not even thinking you 're on automatic pilot photos two purple hearts and a bronze star were left in a plastic bag on jan 20 at the cos cob post office bob vacca , officer in charge at the post office , pointing out where the medals were dropped off \( photographs by janet durrans for the new york times \)

senior republican lawmakers on sunday criticized the probable choice of gen michael v hayden to lead the central intelligence agency , voicing concerns about his ties to a controversial eavesdropping program and about the wisdom of installing a military officer at the civilian spy agency in a possible preview of the difficulties that would await general hayden on capitol hill , several republicans , including some with close ties to the white house , said president bush should find someone else to run the embattled agency i do believe he is the wrong person , the wrong place , at the wrong time , representative peter hoekstra , a michigan republican and chairman of the house intelligence committee , said on fox news sunday we should not have a military person leading a civilian agency at this time , mr hoekstra said several military officers have led the cia , but mr hoekstra said it would be wrong to install one when the agency was fending off efforts by the pentagon to expand its own spying operations mr hoekstra would not directly participate in a debate over general hayden , because the senate , not the house , is responsible for confirming the president s nominee none of the republican or democratic lawmakers who appeared on television on sunday or who were interviewed separately said directly that they would vote against general hayden s nomination he would replace porter j goss , who was forced to resign friday after repeatedly clashing with john d negroponte , the director of national intelligence , over the cia s loss of status as the nation s premier spy agency but mr hoekstra s remarks , coupled with similar sentiments expressed by leading senate republicans , including pat roberts , the chairman of the senate intelligence committee , suggest that the general might not have an easy ride toward confirmation members of that committee , which will conduct the confirmation hearings , are likely to ask sharp questions , particularly about defense secretary donald h rumsfeld s drive to expand intelligence operations at the pentagon by doing that , they could express the concerns of intelligence officials who are constrained by their jobs from speaking out the nomination of general hayden , which is expected to be formally announced by president bush on monday , will also almost certainly revive the controversy surrounding the domestic eavesdropping program at the national security agency , which he once oversaw critics of the program , including senator arlen specter , a pennsylvania republican and chairman of the senate judiciary committee , may try to use the nomination to force the white house to provide more information about it some top republicans , like senator john mccain of arizona , praised the choice of general hayden on sunday but others , including two members of the senate intelligence committee , echoed mr hoekstra senator saxby chambliss , a georgia republican and white house ally , said that even if general hayden were to resign his military commission , he would still face problems being accepted at the spy agency just resigning commission and moving on , putting on a pinstriped suit versus an air force uniform , i do n't think makes much difference , mr chambliss said on this week on abc senator roberts , of kansas , praised general hayden s background but acknowledged that there is real concern about a military officer leading the agency i'm not in a position to say that i am for general hayden and will vote for him , mr roberts said on late edition on cnn one senior administration official , who was granted anonymity because the nomination had not been announced , said it had yet to be determined whether general hayden would retire from the air force at the same time , the official echoed mr chambliss s view that the decision was unlikely to affect how general hayden , now a deputy to mr negroponte , would be received at the agency if general hayden does not retire and earns confirmation , military officers would be in charge of all of the major spy agencies , including the national security agency and the defense intelligence agency the choice of general hayden to lead the cia means that another military officer , vice adm albert m calland iii , now the agency s deputy director , would probably step down , current and former intelligence officials said the officials said admiral calland s successor was likely to be a veteran of the directorate of operations , the agency s clandestine service general hayden s background is in satellite intelligence , not human spying , and the officials said it would make sense to install a former clandestine officer as his deputy electionyear politics will undoubtedly play a part in the confirmation process with president bush s low approval ratings , republicans may try to distance themselves from the white house and demonstrate their independence by subjecting general hayden to tougher questioning than past nominees democrats , for their part , will try to use the hearings , which have not been scheduled and will be held in open and closed sessions , to emphasize what they regard as failed intelligence policies one democrat , senator ron wyden of oregon , vowed in an interview that general hayden would not get a pass on the eavesdropping issue he said he intended to use the hearings to try to force the release of a report by the cia inspector general on the agency s performance before the sept 11 attacks these hearings on hayden are going to be some of the most important that have been held in a long time , because the congress has been kept in the dark on a handful of issues , said mr wyden , who is on the senate intelligence committee he cannot expect to come to the witness table before our committee and repeat the empty statements the administration has made about the nsa program , mr wyden said senator specter , who has spoken out repeatedly against the domestic surveillance program , said he was considering whether to call general hayden as a witness during a future round of hearings about it i'm going to give some consideration to whether we might be able to bring him before the

, summoning him as a witness could create difficulty because nominees are typically loath to speak in public outside of their confirmation hearings that would require his willingness to come forward , and the administration s willingness to come forward , mr specter said the senior bush administration official said the white house welcomed a public discussion about the nsa program during general

ez , the family s only legal resident , and other relatives and friends , moved with her daughters into a small rented house furnished from flea markets my daughters were in peace , irma recalled , proud in that accomplishment , her last name and those of some relatives not being disclosed here because they have been illegal immigrants no one bothered us then one night over dinner , three years ago , her daughter mayra , a high school senior , stunned her with the news that she was pregnant and intended to marry her boyfriend another daughter , barbie , not yet 16 , was adamant that said she , too , was getting married and moving out i was so depressed , irma said all i wanted was to pick up my stuff and leave disillusioned and feeling abandoned , she attended her daughters' courthouse weddings on a wednesday but did not stick around for the weekend parties she made a quick round of goodbyes to her sister raquel and another sister , ver \? a , who was also living illegally in san antonio by friday she was on her way back to mexico with her youngest daughter , passengers in a pickup truck that joined the exodus of immigrants who at some point cross in the opposite direction to go back home even with the benefit of having sisters nearby , the kind of support that many immigrants cannot do without , irma felt she could not stay without mayra to give her a hand with the driving , child care and other needs that can become particularly daunting for a single mother she left one daughter her dining room set , washing machine and refrigerator the other got her living room set , kingsize bed and two dressers i doled out everything , irma said i cried so much because it took so much sacrifice to avail myself of things and i had to get rid of them now all she has to show for her migration to the united states , she said , is the heartache of separation her youngest daughter , lupita , and another daughter , who is married and has three children , now live together just a few blocks from her but the other two are still in texas , still illegally , now with one americanborn child each the border is now a barrier between the mexican and american sides of her family , and now irma feels the pull of her absent daughters the older one has faced her own marital troubles , and both of their families recently moved into an uncle s house to share expenses if some illness or emergency befell her girls , irma worries , she could not be there to help them i still feel that i should be with them , supporting them , irma said they 're still children back to the old neighborhood in sweltering heat one evening , with an ear out for duel of passions , the telenovela on the television in the bedroom , irma performed a culinary magic trick she transformed 5 in groceries into a meal of rice with corn , fried potatoes and steamed nopales , cactus , with vegetables to feed two daughters , three grandchildren and two visitors , and still have enough waiting for gilberto , a tractortruck mechanic she fell in love with upon her return to monterrey i always got my daughters used to the food from over here , she said , perspiring heavily despite the gusts from a standup fan they 're 100 percent mexican none of that pizza irma has taken up once again in her old neighborhood , a cluster of lowermiddleclass and poor homes at the foot of a mountain called cerro de la silla , or saddle mountain , in this industrial city of 11 million the streets in irma s insular world are lined with ficus trees , and the homes are in varying stages of completion , giving the area the character of a work in progress residents buy the land and then build their houses over time , evolving at the pace of their means floors are still without tile and zinc roofs have yet to be replaced with cement , though gang graffiti spreads faster than kudzu on the exterior walls irma works part time as a bar waitress and lives in the sparsely furnished home she shares with gilberto , 35 , who makes 120 a week and foots most of the couple s household expenses , including the 150 monthly rent the house where she lived before meeting gilberto is still in disrepair , with partly exposed rooms , missing walls and open sections of the roof her daughters still live there , their clothes hanging from bare walls moist from the recent rains and the sofas and light fixtures worn out or broken
i am young enough to have used computers for nearly my entire academic and professional career this makes me , apparently , the de facto computer technician at my school i have been called in my classroom at all hours of the day to solve computer issues in my school , from installing software , to changing printer cartridges , to formatting documents i ve run into several intractable technology issues in new york city classrooms , but none more daunting than the web security and internet control system implanted by the department of education my school s teachers center has exactly one working pc and one working imac for over 30 classroom teachers most classrooms have a computer , but many of these lack printers or internet connectivity , and all of them are patrolled by the symantec security system that blocks all web sites deemed inappropriate by some mysterious criteria most webbased email services are blocked \( for being interactive chat \) this is enormously inconvenient , both because the lack of printers requires complicated rituals of creating a needed classroom document and emailing it to a computer attached to a printer , and because only a handful of teachers at my school have a working department of education email account additionally , teachers at my school have often been prevented from using reasonable internet resources for instructional purposes because of various prohibitions a unit i created last may to study the geography of the world cup soccer teams was thwarted because the web sites i intended to use were blocked for being sportsrelated a kindergarten teacher who had intended to use a reputed webbased chat room for establishing pen pals in a suburban school district ran into the aforementioned interactive chat restriction perhaps most frustratingly , when i attempted to locate the mandated hiv aids curriculum on the department of education s own web site last spring i found it blocked for having exceeded the tolerance of questionable words all of these blocks were encountered while logged on as teachers i understand that the internet can be wild terrain a child can easily find themselves in an unexpected and uncomfortable place if they begin an unsupervised google search for ball players or local bears still , there are many things wrong with this maddeningly inflexible system , to say nothing of the larger technological issues teachers face \( and that truly enrage my colleagues who have recently left wellfunctioning corporate environments \) this security system is one of those small but pervasive issues that not only limit my capacity as a teacher , but also make me feel like a child this year , 13 of my 26 students have some sort of special education or related service need the other day i looked for the web site of an organization whose publications i know well and respect , toleranceorg i was looking for activity ideas to buttress the desire of a student with prosthetic limbs to address his classmates regarding his condition the classroom activities section of the web site , however , exceeded the tolerance of questionable words good thing i know how to use my own home computer

on a bleak fall sunday , when even the foliage in northern westchester has taken on a gloomy cast , ruth zager and james gallagher settle into their booth at the 15th annual caramoor fall art and antiques show in katonah , ny , surrounded by what must be a ton of early american fireplace equipment 75 pairs of 18th and 19thcentury brass andirons , 30 fenders , 80 sets of tools , and enough candlesticks and biscuit tins to outfit half the bedandbreakfasts in the hudson valley already , it has been a bit of a slog driving to the hotel after the preview party friday night , the dealers' fourwheel pack mule a 1997 box truck with 100 , 000 miles broke down in the rain , sending them scurrying for a latenight repair shop and a truck rental and the show s foot traffic , some years a stampede , has been more of a pitterpatter so far the couple shrug it off martha stewart , whose 153acre estate sits across the street from caramoor , stopped by last night to eye some period andirons \( she did n't buy anything , but ms zager says even famousname renovators can take years to decide \) more important , fellow dealers have been streaming by all weekend , bearing sweets , sympathy and shop talk , which , when you 're living the vagabond life on the antiquesshow circuit , is as valuable as a fivefigure sale my sisterinlaw calls us the carny folk , because we 're always on the road , traveling from show to show , said ms zager , who , at 65 , still logs a bonewearying 16 shows a season , most within a fourhour drive of her home in north norwich , ny when we started out , we did 43 a year , but we were 30 years younger then it s as certain as beach days giving way to frosty nights every weekend from september to april , hundreds of art and antiques shows across the united states throw open their doors , most of them , like caramoor , modest operations populated by veteran dealers \( some from as far as california \) and alwaysfickle customers \( who are happy to come unless it s better weather for pumpkinpicking \) these are not the marquee national extravaganzas , like the winter antiques show at the seventh regiment armory in manhattan or the philadelphia antiques show nor are they the noname flea markets that inhabit back roads and church basements , where dreams of unearthing the next indian chief weather vane like the one that fetched 58 million at sotheby s last month clash with the kitschy reality of catshaped cookie jars shows like caramoor are , quite simply , the breadandbutter of the antiques business week after week , they help fill the coffers of local sponsors in the case of caramoor , home to the region s largest outdoor music festival , proceeds go to the estate s house museum and garden guild and they promise a ready stream of customers for the dealers , who often spend more time hauling to shows in houston , aspen and palm beach than they do in their own shops that is , if they have shops for many of caramoor s 31 vendors , the road is the shop with a tough hide , quick wit and comfortable shoes , these road warriors are as skilled at selling themselves as their wares one part historian , one part circus performer , they tightrope their way through 15 , 30 , even 40 shows and thousands of customers a year not even the patina of a vintage car show caramoor s tightly edited display included a 1948 ford woody station wagon , a 1950 jaguar roadster and a 1965 aston martin , all from the celebrated collection of its neighbor ralph lauren is enough to let them relax it s show business , said danielle ann millican , a florham park , nj , dealer in antique botanicals and maps , who travels to about a dozen shows a year you get the bug and you just want to do it there s an excitement to it , like any theater troupe going from town to town her enthusiasm is infectious on oct 21 , caramoor s opening day , ms millican stood in front of an early18thcentury print of a moth , caterpillar and papaya plant , her green eyes twinkling as she told the story of the artist , maria sybilla merian , a germanborn naturalist who divorced her husband and set out in 1699 , at the age of 52 , on a threemonth voyage from amsterdam to surinam to record bugs and plants i love telling people about women like maria and how you can do anything you want to , said ms millican , who left her own career as a hotel executive to sell prints that was 25 years ago as the number of shows has mushroomed in the last few decades , experts say , so has the pressure on dealers to find fresh merchandise and fresh audiences new york is infested with shows , said sanford l smith , who has been in the antiques business for 40 years , half of them spent putting together largescale shows the problem in the entire show business is that people are much busier than they were 10 , 15 , 20 years ago you have a husband and wife working , you have busy kids , and the only time they have to do anything is on weekends , so you 're not seeing the gate you used to

helter swelter oliver kamm 5be 621 west 27th street , chelsea through july 28 for his first solo exhibition , justin lowe has concocted an elaborate installation piece that almost entirely absorbs this modest gallery it starts with a degree of threedimensional realism that is unusual for him a fullscale recreation of a bodega that fills the gallery s reception area with appropriately dense and somewhat sticky displays of food and drink , none of it very nutritional it then segues through a looser evocation of a construction site that you quickly realize is the interior of a large truck exiting at the opposite end reveals it to be an 18foot kool man ice cream truck it will also deliver you to a womblike hippie heaven tiled with clothes wound into tight , colorful spirals this is the place to get high if you have scored at either the bodega counter or the ice cream truck window , places that the gallery s web site describes as classic drug fronts the progression from immigrant elbow grease to recreational consumption may comment on class difference as well as on summer in the city but the fastidious recreations preclude the sculptural invention and weird recycling of materials that are among mr lowe s strengths only when you get to the padded floor does this extravaganza begin to feel like his work until then , it is just one more , extralaborintensive , walkin variation on meret oppenheim s furlined teacup , a frequent pitfall of late that mr lowe has previously avoided roberta smith
if i go to africa , i don t want to see any tragedy i just want to see the animals my doctor said this to me , in between checking my nose and lungs to diagnose me with postafrica bronchitis she is a doctor , and she doesn t want to see any tragedy , just animals i watched a woman die , i said , amazed at my response i have felt funny trying to explain to people what i saw i know they want to hear about the gorillas , about tagging along with nick kristof and maybe some funny anecdotes about what i ate they don t want to hear about death or the children who played with box cutters five feet from their father s grave but why should i glaze over what i really saw in africa \? why should i make it easier for people who ask me how the trip was \? my doctor isn t the only one who d just rather not know a man named bernard posted this comment to my blog thinking they would be inspired by the writing of a woman not much older than they , i assigned my class in editorial and column writing at hunter college of the city university of new york to read it to my surprise , all of them said mr kristof s columns and ms parks blog left them feeling frustrated and depressed or , as one of them put it , crappy and down they felt the only solution offered was to send money , and they have none to send therefore , said one student , there s a limit to how much i can feel because there s a limit to how much i can do all she could do , said another , was cry , and i don t want to cry , so i don t want to read this i wonder what you and other readers would say to my students , who represent the target audience of the entire exercise is it a columnist s job to inspire readers to act or tell them how to act \? i wanted to provide more direction on what to do , but honestly , i had no idea what to suggest a lot of people have been to africa and have come back not knowing what to do does that mean we shouldn t visit \? shouldn t read \? shouldn t know what life is like there \? bad things still happen , even if those students don t read about them i personally don t want to live a life that is unburdened but uninformed and i think our knowing may lead , in the future , to our helping make things better we can t find answers until we start asking questions in the simplest of ways , students can speak up , let politicians and policy makers know that issues like maternal mortality , the global impact of aids and the crisis in darfur matter to people our age the president of the central african republic , president bozize , came to the recent united nations assembly , and the bush administration made available only a deputy assistant secretary of state the central african republic is right next to sudan and chad and experiencing so much instability right now if these places aren t looked at , the horrors of darfur will spread \( they already are spreading \) and how does our government respond \? by not allowing the president \( who had great ideas about curbing the violence spawned by the darfur conflict \) to speak with someone who can actually make a difference , policywise bozize s best idea is to place un peacekeepers in chad and the central african republic the un peacekeepers are currently not in sudan because of the country s rebellion , but placing the troops in these bordering countries will stop rebels from pouring into chad and the central african republic if students start speaking up , people like president bozize might get a better platform , which would save so many lives in his country i know it is easier to just not read about the tragedies i skipped over plenty of television programs about dying children before i went to africa but learning about them will lead to faster solutions it is our responsibility to learn about the problems that exist outside of our own circles though my first trip to africa has ended , there are plenty of other blogs that provide reliable information about life in other places in the world here are a few if you d rather see the countries yourself , start looking for a way to make it happen i heard about one cool opportunity for a student jim panos , the charg d affairs for the central african republic , needs an intern for the summer he is a really funny , vibrant and smart man and could really teach someone a lot applicants should know french it would really be a great opportunity he lives in the capital , so it s not too desolate , but you could really come to understand a lot about car through working with him correction to apply for the internship with jim panos interested applicants should go to the applicants should request an internship at the embassy in bangui , central african republic , and indicate if they speak french if you d prefer to stay home , or don t have the money to donate , go to a concert sound funny \? myspace is hosting over a dozen concerts on oct 21 under their rock for darfur moniker proceeds from each concert go toward helping end the genocide in darfur and i will return to my old blog what i learned in africa has changed everything about the way i live here i can t wait to get back to learn more
for the next week or so , george mason will be one of the biggest names in basketball he had about as much influence on the game as abner doubleday had on baseball , which is to say none at all but with the stunning entry of george mason university of fairfax , va , in the ncaa tournament s final four , the question arises who was george mason \? for most americans , his memory pales alongside that of washington , jefferson , adams or madison because he never held high office but mason was in the first rank of the founding fathers , having articulated the doctrine of inalienable rights as formulated in the declaration of independence the owner of a vast plantation , gunston hall , along the potomac river near alexandria , va , mason drafted the virginia constitution and the virginia declaration of rights in the spring of 1776 in the first draft , he wrote in the declaration that all men are born equally free and independant , sic and have certain inherent natural rights , among them the enjoyment of life and liberty in 1787 , mason served as a delegate to the constitutional convention in philadelphia in large part because the constitution did not contain a statement on individual rights , mason voted against its adoption he was vindicated in 1791 , a year before his death , with the adoption of the bill of rights he was reluctant to leave gunston hall now , george mason is going to indianapolis richard goldstein photo \( photo by nick wass associated press \)

dissent \? and a yellow to the penalty taker , i believe gyan 65 danger in the czech area penalty \? penalty \? yes penal penal penal penal amoah taken down in the area ! 60 on the hour ! if this result holds up , the czechs and ghana will be tied with 3 points each ! an american victory over italy later unlikely would leave all the teams at 3 59 danger ! gyan crosses into the box and it s headed clear by a defender , but cech , leaping out , flattens his teammate jankulovski ! 58 flank defender grygera starting to make inroads down the left side , like he did on the first goal against the us are the czechs starting to step it up \? 56 great movement by czechia ! five players spread it the breadth of the field as they advance at full speed , and it ends with plasil shooting from the left side kingson just tips it over the bar ! 55 sub poborsky comes out , and jiri stajner comes in a swap of midfielders the abc announcers point out smartly that poborsky at 34 might be out of gas 52 cech , a leaping save ! he stops gyan s lashing drive from the halfmoon muy bien ghana ! 51 big lokvenc goes up high for a ball into the box and nods it wide of the post he s out there to do the job koller normally does , but he was never in that position in the first half maybe now coach bruckner has made him the target man 49 yellow to lokvenc for a harsh foul on essien 46 a czech goal a few seconds in called back for offside ! i think it was nedved who shot from far away , but a forward was offside , so no goal there s also a sub for the czechs , jan polak in at midfield to replace the defender galasek and a sub for the black stars midfielder derek boateng in for midfielder otto addo more halftime someone writes in to ask about the yellow card issued to essien both he and i thought it was being given to nedved for reckless play hey , i don t get it either perhaps the ref thought essien was the one being reckless \? anyway , to set the record straight , the only yellows issued in the first half were to essien and otto addo , both of ghana other stats posession was 5050 , ghana committed 13 fouls to czechia s 9 halftime looking in on your comments are you guys really criticizing the abc announcers for their mispronunciation of ashanti twi \? that s a pretty high standard you re setting ghana did play pretty well for stretches against italy on monday , and in fact the country s president , john agyekum kufuor , who attended that match , expressed his pride in ghana s performance but then again , he s the president he s supposed to 45 1 one minute added nedved breaks free on the left and gets deep , but his cross is cut off ghana bring it back the other way but tweet ! senor elizondo s whistle brings halftime ghana 1 , czech republic 0 45 beautiful passing in the czech area by ghana ! they don t get a shot off , but four men combine on the right to give the czechs fits ! 43 great movement by the czechs ! five touches covering 50 yards , started by rosicky and extended by nedved , ends with poborsky on the right flag passing into the middle the ball pings around and winds up rolling out two yards wide of the left goalpost 42 plasil , given the ball at the edge of the area on a poor play by a ghana defender , squanders a chance by passing it back weakly to the wrong team 41 yellow nedved ouch ! kicked gyan in the crotch while going for the ball an accident , but he s been booked for reckless play 40 appiah just misses ! gyan jitterbugs and draws defenders to him , then sends it to an open appiah 25 yards from goal he shoots just wide , and cech was frozen to the spot too appiah missed the post by only a yard or so 38 rosicky rosicky rosicky another great run , this time up the right , but his pass into the middle is cut off he s running wild again today , but the czechs 451 formation is leaving them with insufficient numbers up front to press the advantage rosicky and nedved are winning in the midfield 36 i can t quite believe i m seeing this ghana living up to their reputation and making a group of death of this now nedved barrels into essien as they go after a loose ball fortunately , no damage done 35 close call in front of the ghana goal ! kingson gets stranded on a cross , then some sloppy defending gives the czechs a second and third chance but they can t quite get the shot off and the ball is cleared on a bicycle kick by mensah now kingson atones ! he makes a great exit to cut off a high ball all the way out at the edge of his box 33 cech ! he saves off a brilliant ghanaian movement ! essien initiates a multipass movement in tight space asamoah gyan got the ball at the end and was perhaps a hair offside , but he took the shot and the great cech was right in front of him to smother it 32 que partido ! that s what they re saying on univision , and they re right this one s a cracker ! 31 amoah just misses ! set up , i believe , by appiah , he gets the ball in the box , turns on a dime , but sends it just wide of the right post ! 30 poborsky just misses ! he was set up by nedved and open on the right , but he slid the shot just wide of the post 28 now a free kick at the side of the ghana area poborsky to take two in the wall he crosses it to the top of the box to the open jankulovski , but the ghana defenders close him down immediately and smother the shot well defended ! 27 another ghana corner ! muntari to take he gets the ball back and shoots but it goes six feet over the bar ghana controlling play ! 26 danger ! ghana a free kick from the side of the czech box the ball bounces around dangerously before being cleared for a corner but the corner is cleared away 25 illiasu shilla makes a great defensive play , sliding out to stop a dangerous czech thrust from the flank 24 muntari allowed to gambol free through the midfield for ghana he shoots well wide , but he had so much space ! 22 great run by rosicky ! he goes through three opponents on an arrowstraight 25yard run nothing comes of it , but what an impressive play ! 20 nedved draws three men to him he s the best the czechs have at the moment now he s set up a free kick 35 yards from goal who will take \? nedved but it s a poor , rolling shot that goes harmlessly out 18 yellow otto addo of ghana chops down plasil and is deservedly booked but the resulting free kick , hoofed into the area , is deftly taken care of by the ghanaian defenders here s an interesting footnote the 23 men on ghana play for 23 different club teams that s unique among the teams at this world cup 14 appiah fires from 25 yards and just misses the post ! cech dove for it not sure he would ve gotten to it had it been headed for the side netting 11 ghana look great , every bit the equal of the czechs better , actually but now nedved ! he shoots right at kingson in the ghana net rosicky set him up by running 20 yards unupposed , then laying off to the lion of juventus but a disappointing shot 10 rob mackey has texted in to tell me that the pass that set up the goal was made by stephen appiah he gets the assist , well deserved appiah , that is mackey too 6 an early goal for ghana bruce arena whined , frankly , that when the czechs scored early against the americans on monday , it was a crushing blow let s see if the czechs will be crushed for the remaining 85 minutes of this game just because ghana scored on them early 4 i didn t see who made the pass to gyan for ghana i was still typing stuff from the start of the game ! but it was a beautiful pass the czechs take a shot ! jankulovski fires just wide of the post from 20 yards out 2nd minute goooooaaaaaallllllll ghana ! ghana ! ghana ! a ghanaian corner , cech parries away but the ball is knocked back into the halfmoon , and there gyan chests it down and fires , beating the diving cech to the right ! unbelievable ! ghana 1 , czechia 0 ! it s 25 celsius , 77 fahrenheit the referee is horacio elizondo of argentina he asks both keepers if they re ready the czechs to kick off it s on !  the teams are out on the field the czechs in red shirts and blue shorts , listen to their anthem , and in the stands , the fans stand with their arms over their neighbors shoulders , singing along the players look pretty grim , like they did before the us game and now the ghanian anthem the players , in all white , hold their hands over their hearts many in the stands are singing there are a lot of ghana fans here the song ends , and the ghana players turn and applaud their fans if only american sports teams did things like that !  i should point something out to counter all the talk about the us being in a must win situation against italy later today , which is what they re saying now on abc while it s true that a victory is vitally important , a draw would keep the americans alive as well they d go into the third and final match against ghana needing to win , and probably by at least a couple of goals and in the other finale , czechiaitaly , either the czechs or the italians would have to win decisively what does that mean for us fans watching czechiaghana \? they d probably prefer ghana to win , but that seems like a long shot against a team that looked so impressive last time out  now here s a coincidence the castle i was referring to just below is the medieval castle that overlooks prague and is the seat of the nation s government when czechs love someone , they shout soandso to the castle ! but there s a castle in ghana too originally built by the danes , it overlooks accra and is today the seat of the nation s government what are the odds \?  hello again , soccer fans around the world ! what are you doing inside on a day like this \? you should be out with the throngs at the beer gardens and teahouses , getting ready to watch today s apocalyptic group e matches , ghanaczech and italyusa but if for some reason you must be inside by a computer , then let s watch this together it s gonna be awesome ! the czechs are coming off their comprehensive 30 thumping of the us on monday , and a win today puts them through to the next round but that victory of the americans did have a cost they lost their big , bald target man , jan koller , to a hamstring injury at least for this match and possibly for more they ll also be without their creative striker milan baros , who has been battling a foot injury for quite some time ghana , for their part , are a healthy team but they must get some kind of result today in the aftermath of their 20 loss to italy on monday they ll be trying for it in the loud atmosphere of the amazingly intimate rheinenergie stadium , which was rebuilt last year along the lines of a british football ground , tight to the field on all sides the carloads of czech fans who have driven across germany to be there today will be in full throat , cheering their heroes to the castle , and you bohemians and moravians out there know exactly what i mean by that the lineups ! for karel bruckner s side , a 451 but don t be deceived that midfield , with roiscky and nedved in it , is as deadly as any striking partnership you can think of g cech petr d grygera zdenek \( carrying a yellow \) d galasek tomas \( c \) d jankulovski marek d rozehnal david \( carrying a yellow \) d ujfalusi tomas m poborsky karel m rosicky tomas \( carrying a yellow \) m nedved pavel m plasil jaroslav f lokvenc vratislav for ratomir dujkovic s ghana , a 442 , led by the talismanic midfielder stars michael essien of chelsea and stephen appiah of fenerbahce g kingson richard d mensah john d shilla illiasu d mohamed habib d pantsil john m essien michael m appiah stephen \( c \) m muntari sulley \( carrying a yellow \) m addo otto f gyan asamoah \( carrying a yellow \) f amoah matthew
large , sprawling group exhibitions are like allyoucaneat restaurants there is usually too much available and none of it very good but occasionally you hit upon something tasty and out of the ordinary , like masha ryskin s and margaret kimura s billowing fabric installation upstairs at the westchester arts council arts exchange gallery in white plains it is raw , inventive and trippy qualities that seem an embodiment of the condition of contemporary art now their installation is part of winter solstice iv , an annual holiday season talent roundup shared , this year , between the studio an alternative space for contemporary art in armonk , and the arts exchange the combined twosite package is a handsome , dizzyingly eclectic sampler of the work of just over 50 artists gathered from the westchester area and beyond about a third of the artists are taking part in the exhibition for the first time the ryskinkimura installation , titled dusk \( 2005 \) , approximates the appearance of a scaled topographical model the folds , bulges , creases and dips in the fabric resemble the natural contours of uneven , hilly terrain here and there the artists have installed bound sheaths of cut paper , which in this context resemble buildings dotted about the landscape paper airplanes , or something like them , dangle upside down from fishing wire other installations in the exhibition employ video , projected imagery , everyday materials and light the bulk are on display at the arts exchange , where there is ample room for the artists to stretch out among them is kaz mccue s shut up \( 2004 \) , an installation construction of surgical masks dangling from a sort of rack decorated with symbols , suggesting an eye chart it is hard to make out what this work is about , but i guess it has something to do with medicine mr mccue has several pieces in the exhibition , providing viewers an opportunity to assess his work in depth i was particularly taken by a video installation over at the studio , which was conceived after the artist s mother began to suffer from dementia and the artist moved her into his home it charts the process of her mental deterioration , while more generally inviting us to pause and reflect on memory and forgetting back over at the arts exchange , several works prompt similarly deep thought healing space \( 2005 \) , by euyoung hong , is another medicineoriented piece , the artist dangling dozens of plastic infusion sets from a wallmounted square black plexiglass box it is meant to symbolize a space for reflection and an opportunity for viewers to heal any psychic ailments but it is not all gloom and doom guaranteed to make you go all warm and possibly fuzzy inside are a pair of luis perelman s log cabin series of paintings , made from cut strips of soda and beer cans arranged in mandalalike fashion on masonite boards they are funky and fun , and bemuse you if you stare at them too long but , over all , they stir an amused empathy in the viewer mr perelman , who is from yonkers , is a wellrespected local artist , and among several here who deserve to be better known the problem is that , solidarity aside , to show in these kinds of exhibitions does very little to advance reputations beyond the westchester art community what we really need are exhibitions of westchester artists outside of westchester otherwise it is just preaching to the choir wendy wilkinsongordon is another serious , committed artist with several excellent sculptures showing at the arts exchange she works with ideas of survival , making cubed podlike formations out of silversoldered wire and paper beyond that they are just beautiful abstract forms , which she often hangs diagonally out from the wall nearby , in what was once the vault of a bank , are several of andrew senior s sculptural concoctions based on a mix of ideas about the landscape , money and entropy none seem terribly exciting , to be honest , but i did like the way in which mr senior , rather appropriately for a bank vault , employed united states currency as a material there is also something sincerely romantic about his art and ideas , which helps to soften any negative reactions the exhibition also includes several terrific paintings , among them a pair of atmospheric abstracts by bendel hydes , at the arts exchange , and at the other site , kiyoharu goto s warm , subtle abstractions with luscious glazed surfaces the work of these two artists lingers long in the mind s eye a compliment to their skill and talent winter solstice iv ,

tucked away in the woods off a winding side road here , the lawrence aviation industries plant has kept a very low profile since it was established in the 1950 s all that most locals ever saw of the place was the gate and guardhouse just beyond a private railroad crossing along sheep pasture road and no wonder lawrence aviation made titanium parts for advanced military aircraft like the grumman f14 fighter jet environmental officials say that it also made a terrible mess there is substantial evidence , they say , that the 160acre plant property is the scene of some of the most serious soil and groundwater pollution on long island , posing a threat of still unknown proportions to people living as far as a mile away the owner , gerald cohen , who has locked horns with officialdom many times over environmental issues , business practices and unpaid property taxes , says that it is n't so , and that the site has only minor problems the issue may come to a head soon , when the federal environmental protection agency releases results of an investigation it is completing into chemical contamination at lawrence aviation the report is expected to include recommendations for cleaning up the property , one of 11 in suffolk county on the national superfund list of highpriority contamination sites mr cohen said in a telephone interview on monday that the investigation would find only minimal problems we are hopeful that epa would take a reasonable view , and we can get on with our lives , he said records of past government inspections at the site describe large numbers of 55gallon drums , vats and other containers in and around the 200 , 000squarefoot plant building many of the drums contained contaminants and hazardous substances and were unlabeled or poorly labeled , the records indicate in 2004 , the federal agency removed more than 66 tons of hazardous waste from the plant for disposal state department of environmental conservation investigators have reported spills and leaks at the property , including leaks from diesel generators the state is suing mr cohen and his company , charging them with a host of violations of state environmental law among other accusations , the state says that the generators were installed and run without necessary permits and in violation of orders from the department , and that mr cohen continued operations at his plant in defiance of a court order the plant is now idle , its stock of titanium sheets seized for back taxes by county sheriffs \( though still stored on the site \) the state lawsuit is before justice elizabeth h emerson of state supreme court in riverhead , where a ruling is awaited a central issue is whether lawrence aviation is the likely source of toxic contamination beyond the plant s perimeter , in the wells of 11 nearby homes and in mill creek and mill creek pond , a mile north of the plant in the heart of port jefferson village peter a scully , the long island regional director for the state conservation department , said that studies done so far indicated that contamination from lawrence was seeping north to the pond and creek , which are downhill from the plant , and was continuing into port jefferson harbor groundwater in the area generally flows northward the state department of health has posted signs at the pond warning against drinking the water or having prolonged exposure to it in the late 1990 s , the state paid to connect homes north of the plant to public water mains salvatore badalamenti , the epa s project manager for the lawrence aviation site , said that determining whether the plant was the source of these problems was one focus of its investigation samples of soil , surface water , groundwater and sediment have been collected , and findings and a cleanup plan are to be presented by the agency at a public meeting in may on nov 29 , the federal agency for toxic substances and disease registry classified the lawrence site as an indeterminate public health hazard gregory ulirsch , a senior environmental health scientist for the agency , said the risks could be better gauged once the epa s report was completed we are somewhat uncertain at this point about potential exposure pathways , dr ulirsch said stephen m jones , the chief executive of the suffolk county water authority , said that while there were about 47 public wells within five miles of lawrence aviation , none were in the area likely to be affected by groundwater flowing from the plant property about 120 , 000 people live within four miles of the plant in water samples drawn from monitoring wells at the edge of the lawrence property and from residential wells nearby , the epa has found volatile industrial solvents like trichloroethylene and tetrachloroethylene over decades , drinking water containing traces of those solvents would moderately increase the risk of developing cancer , officials said sy f robbins , a hydrogeologist for the suffolk county department of health services , said that while there appeared to be one fairly welldefined plume of groundwater contamination extending north from the lawrence property , there was no direct evidence yet that the plant was the source of contamination in mill creek and mill creek pond it s hard to prove these kinds of things , he said

markos moulitsas zuniga , the proprietor of daily kos and the inspiration for this weekend s yearly kos bloggers conference \( where so far , the american prospect s ezra klein reports , attendees have barely outnumbered those writing about the attendees \) , has frequently professed to have no ideology other than the democrats winning but in a post this week titled the libertarian dem , moulitsas explains the philosophy that connects him to the candidates he supports they are all libertarian democrats traditional libertarianism holds that government is evil and thus must be minimized , moulitsas writes the problem with this form of libertarianism is that it assumes that only two forces can infringe on liberty the government and other individuals the libertarian democrat understands that there is a third danger to personal liberty the corporation unlike actual libertarians \( moulitsas calls them traditional libertarians \) , these libertarian democrats are not hostile to government , moulitsas writes , because government can protect our liberties from those who would infringe upon them corporations and other individuals moulitsas goes beyond the usual libertarian endorsement of socalled negative freedom , protecting individuals from government interference , and embraces the concept of positive freedom \( though he does not use the term \) , a concept that is closer to what most people think of as opportunity or equality , rather than freedom in essence , he s rebranding the word freedom under the umbrella of freedom , moulitsas includes support for such things as public transportation , poverty prevention programs , and health care he writes the core democratic values of fairness , opportunity , and investing in our nation and people very much speak to the concept of personal liberties an open society where success is predicated on the merit of our ideas and efforts , unduly burdened by the government , corporate america , or other individuals and rather than always get in the way , government can facilitate this  the key here isn t universal liberty from government intrusion , but policies that maximize individual freedom , and who can protect those individual freedoms best from those who would infringe at tapped , ezra klein calls moulitsas s manifesto possibly the first full account of his personal political philosophy conservative bloggers tend to paint moulitsas as a deranged leftwinger , but klein doesn t see any difference between the views expressed in his essay and those embraced by secondterm bill clinton kos is describing nothing so much as a socially laissezfaire populist with a patina of new democrat market affection a synthesis of current tendencies , rather than a new approach , klein writes , adding that moulitsas s preferred politicians share a muscular authenticity rather than an ideology reason s hit run bloggers , perhaps surprisingly , aren t openly hostile to moulitsas s adaptation of libertarianism david weigel seems open to the idea but writes , i m not sure that i buy it jesse walker gives advice to democrats looking to appeal to libertarian voters when republicans are bad on civil liberties and foreign policy , be an alternative extend your social tolerance to folks to the other side of the culture war and if you can t be as promarket as friedrich hayek , try at least to be as promarket as jerry brown the bloggers at cato liberty are more skeptical the libertarianism kos describes checks its antistatism at the door , emphasizes economic security and fears corporate power as much as state power , gene healy writes he continues does the libertarian democrat exist \? it s doubtful , though kos has a few examples , including the impressive james webb , vietnam war hero , former secretary of the navy , and current democratic challenger to virginia senator george allen but then the libertarian republican has been an elusive creature of late as well , judging by the gop s constitutional amendment fetish the last time the flagburning amendment came up for a vote in the house , only an even dozen republicans voted against it , and only a couple of those could reasonably be described as libertarian neither party is a reliable friend of liberty , but any effort to move either party in the right direction ought to be applauded the democratic party is quite unlikely to evolve in the direction kos s post suggests but if it did , for all its flaws , it would still beat big government conservatism any day of the week cato s will wilkinson agrees that libertarians have very little in common with the gop in its present incarnation , and he concedes that it really is worth pointing out common ground between libertarians and the left but he doesn t see what moulitsas s manifesto offers libertarians that democrats don t offer them already he writes insofar as political commitment isn t simply a matter of personality , or of reflexive adherence to what the people around you happen to believe , i think the barrier between liberals and libertarians has almost entirely to do with different answers to empirical questions about the way markets and governments function the different syndromes of approving and disapproving sentiments about market and state characteristic of libertarians and welfare state liberals more or less follow upon these prior judgments of fact libertarians and liberals classical liberals and welfare state liberals are generally the same kind of people at the level of certain core aspects of personality that tend to influence political affiliation the difference , then , is likely a function of the way different sets of beliefs mediate the expression of personality the thing that keeps me from throwing my lot in with democrats has everything to do with their consistent underestimation of the efficacy and justice of institutions that make the most of the information carried by market prices , and their consistent overestimation of the efficacy and justice of bureaucratic political management love markets more , and love the state less , and libertarians may come a knockin in addition , wilkinson writes , i think kos underestimates just how wary of corporations libertarians generally are but libertarians believe in checking the corporation by reducing state power , not increasing it classical liberal political economy tells us that the greater the scope and power of state coercion , the stronger the incentive for economically powerful private interests , such as corporations , to use it to their own advantage , squashing competition , consolidating advantage , and channeling taxpayer dollars into corporate coffers the idea of positive freedom is rather in opposition to the classical libertarian notion of liberty as noninterference , wilkinson continues he fears that moulitsas is simply declaring a pretty standard set of democratic policies as libertarian , in defiance of the normal understanding of the term also at cato , radley balko dubs moutlisas s philosophy liberaltarianism he proposes a person s gut reaction to seat belt laws as a litmus test for determining whether the person is a liberal or a libertarian if you think pulling people over and fining them for failing to do a good enough job protecting themselves in their own automobiles is a legitimate function of government , there s probably not much common ground to be had between you and libertarians if you think it s wise to wear a seatbelt , but that it s really none of the government s business , well , then , let s talk
standing near the empty corner of kingsley and fourth on a bright afternoon as another summer was draining away , dennis dubrow got that wistful look in his eyes that people here tend to get when they start talking about what asbury park once was , when everybody was younger and nobody believed the summers would ever end riding the circuit , on a summer night , around and around , he said , nodding toward the wide , untrafficked boulevard as if he could conjure again the slow parade of cruising cars a mile down kingsley and then , one block over , a mile back up ocean avenue along the back side of the boardwalk , and then around again and again until you found what you were looking for looming now between mr dubrow and the boardwalk was the ragged landscape of change dirt hills , rubble mounds , utility trenches and shiny , hopeful signs announcing new condominium towers a pile driver beat a slow , steady bass line behind him stood the old vaudeville theater from which he had just emerged the longdormant baronet , which mr dubrow helped to open again as a 2 movie house a few weeks ago , and which the city council , at its meeting on wednesday night , may vote to seize by eminent domain we saved a little bit of asbury park s history here , he said what s going to happen now , i do n't know the baronet and its two neighbors on an otherwise barren block have emerged as the site of the latest skirmish in the longrunning battle over asbury s future next door is the fast lane , the shuttered nightclub where an impossibly young u2 once played and where an unknown jon bon jovi once opened for mr dubrow s own longforgotten band next door to that is asbury lanes , a bowling alley that at night becomes a retrohipster music scene , with punkrock karaoke nights and bands on a stage set up over the four middle lanes but the businesses stand in the way of the city s ambitious waterfront redevelopment plan , adopted with much fanfare and optimism in 2002 after two decades of limbo two decades during which corrupt officials , a bankrupt developer , dueling lawsuits and economic uncertainty left this oncegrand resort to molder and crumble the condos going up near the boardwalk are the first of more than 3 , 000 planned for the waterfront , including the baronet s block you ca n't do the plan unless you 've got the land , said deputy mayor james bruno , an asbury native and retired firefighter who , like many other longtime residents , says he believes his hometown has endured too many rough years and is not inclined to throw roadblocks in the way of the waterfront developer , asbury partners we have an agreement with asbury partners if they need properties for eminent domain , we have to take them the city has taken a handful of properties so far , but none was ever host to the three stooges , live as the baronet once was or provoked so many people to protest at council meetings the redevelopment plan is inherently flawed , and this is a great example of why , said councilman james keady , a fiveyear resident , who says the plan neglects the rest of the city in favor of an upscale waterfront he is opposed to using eminent domain in this case it did n't protect and enhance an architectural and cultural asset like the baronet theater , he said built for vaudeville in 1913 , the baronet was screening triplex movies by the 1980 s patrick fasano mr dubrow s business partner , who has been redeveloping properties in asbury for a decade bought the theater and the fast lane for 575 , 000 apiece in december mr fasano made , by his account , 100 , 000 worth of repairs , and by july the vintage 1933 carbonarc projectors were showing real movies again the fast lane remains closed , and mr fasano s plans for it remain vague we 're good enough to be here when nobody else wanted to be here , and then when it s all new and shiny , there can only be olive garden and red lobster \? asked mr fasano , who rejected an offer from asbury partners for the two properties that was less than what he paid \( asbury lanes is not part of the current eminent domain case \) larry fishman , the chief operating officer of asbury partners , expressed skepticism about mr fasano s motives the baronet theater and the fast lane were both closed for many years before being acquired by the current owner and were only opened in order to extract added value from the properties , mr fishman said for now , though , asbury park once again has a movie theater , and the baronet s spiffedup facade is attracting the occasional curious visitor , like the one who showed up a few weeks ago while mr dubrow was working there i said to him , 'jon bon jovi , you did a little bit better in the music business than i did , ' mr dubrow said and i told him , 'if you ever want to strap on a guitar , this stage is yours' photo \( photo by dith pran the new york times \)
rosemary palladino of yonkers recently had to give up her beloved bmw sports car for a toyota 4runner why \? because she is a band mom and her son , raff ferraioli , 15 , is a drummer , requiring a tremendous amount of equipment when he plays i always have to be available because the drums have to be transported , mrs palladino said i loved my bmw , but he really did need the room there has been a lot of talk about soccer moms and ice hockey moms and the sacrifices they make to keep their athletic children in the game but band moms \( and dads \) , whose kids would rather be inducted into the rock 'n' roll hall of fame than featured on the espn play of the week , can put their odometers up against the other parents' , anytime on top of that , they must contend with the megadecibels emanating from their basements at all hours rule one for high school bands is that practice takes place at the drummer s house \( drums can be transported for gigs , but they are the least mobile of the instruments \) raff s group , tonight at ten , which he described as pop punk , began by practicing in the family s garage but mrs palladino was worried about disturbing the neighbors , so she cleared out a space in the basement before any complaints began the band has come a long way raff got his first set of drums when he was 3 , and he s been banging away ever since , mrs palladino said in december 2005 band members made their own cd , complete with color labels they produced at staples a month later the band won the westchester county battle of the bands at the county center in white plains avra tietze is a double band mom her son max , 17 , is lead guitarist for solar tides \( which won the county battle of the bands at playland in rye last summer \) , and her son harrison , 15 , is drummer for hugs for strangers ms tietze described solar tides as groove rock and said that until recently , when max got his driver s license , she and her husband , michael , drove to all the performances the band equipment filled two vans their own and that of the drummer s parents timothy horan of tuckahoe said basically , being a roadie for your son is what it comes down to mr horan s 17yearold son , jonathan , plays lead guitar and writes the music for a band called the tragic and being a roadie is more complicated when the artists are teenagers mr horan pointed out that although jonathan and his fellow band members are all under age , the tragic sometimes plays in clubs where alcohol is served you have to be there to make sure everything is on the up and up and that he s safe , he said similarly , although max tietze has a driver s license , his dad needs to be on site for performances , to videotape the show for the band to critique later as for the music quality , parents say bands are easier on the ears once they have been together a while sometimes , these loyal fans acknowledge , the early stages of band development can be painful linda atkinson s son , crockett doob , started a group in 1995 , when he was still in middle school it is still together , based in hastingsonhudson so far it has performed under the names sorry porky , kiwis under rubber tutus and , most recently , skeleton breath because crockett is the drummer , rehearsals have often taken place in ms atkinson s basement when they first began and they were really bad , she recalled , the thing that they loved more than anything else was volume the worse they were , the louder they were it only compounds the problem , she said , when fathers overidentify with their rocker offspring because a lot of dads have old rock 'n' roll dreams themselves , they keep buying their sons louder amplifiers , she said i finally put a sign on my basement door that said , 'if anyone brings a bigger amplifier , the father has to sit through rehearsal' such issues tend to fade over time , however these days mrs palladino , the yonkers roadie mom , counts herself as one of her son s biggest fans i have grown to love the music , she said of tonight at ten one of the moms said , 'how can you stand it with the practice at your house \? ' i enjoy it they 're really tight they 're great musicians in fact many band parents described themselves as aging hippies , and names like the doors and cream were brought up as favored bands of yesteryear also , parents being parents , some could n't resist a little bragging i think he s a little more talented than mick jagger , said sue guarino of her son , matt , who plays lead guitar for his rock band , bellevue mick never showed his musical talent he just wrinkled his face my son does a great performance mrs guarino , who lives in yonkers , proudly noted that her son also plays bass guitar , drums and keyboard , and that he wrote his own songs and mixed his own two cd s she loves bellevue s music , is happy to deliver snacks of pepsi and popcorn to practices in the basement , and believes matt s song place inside my head could easily be recorded by a wellknown band none of this is to say that parents generally see a glittering rock future for their musically inclined offspring the word college crept into almost every conversation with band parents and several said they saw their children learning valuable life lessons from being in a band mrs palladino , for instance , said she was pleased with the way raff took care of his group s bookings and business deals and mr horan expressed admiration for jonathan s entrepreneurial spirit besides scheduling and promoting the tragic , jonathan borrowed 200 from his father to make tshirts he not only repaid the loan but also made a profit and he made even more by setting up his own battle of the bands in ardsley and charging admission college would expose jonathan to better musicians , mr horan said , as well as enable him to learn about the business side of music mrs palladino said raff and i had a discussion a long time ago that his focus on life is college music is a great thing to have , and maybe some day he 'll go into entertainment law but these kids all know that when they get older , not too many people other than mick jagger are running across stages at the age of 60 photos rosemary palladino and tonight at ten at different stages of a recent gig at iona prep in new rochelle her son , raff ferraioli , second from left above , is the band s drummer other musicians , from left carl bauer , chris iallonardo and paolo varrenti \( photographs by suzanne dechillo the new york times \)
game four wrapup after 12 straight losing seasons , and just three years removed from dropping 119 games , the tigers have staked their claim to be this year s team of destiny coming back from a threerun deficit , the tigers put together a rally with two outs in the bottom of the ninth , against the a s closer , huston street and magglio ordonez , who many people thought the tigers had overpaid for with a 5year , 75 million contract , hit his second hr of the game to win it , and send detroit to the world series with a fourgame sweep disappointment again for billy beane and the oakland a s one of the marvels of smallmarket clubs , the a s consistently get to the playoffs but can t seem to buy any success there as beane told michael lewis in moneyball , the playoffs are a place where luck can trump all sorts of planning my job is to get us to the playoffs what happens after that is luck beane added in a choice word to describe that luck , but being a family web site we are proscribed from reprinting that adjective here thanks to bill mccauley for moderating our discussion board and thanks again to everyone who checked in during the game stay tuned for our fellow gametrackers and moderators in game 3 of the metscardinals series bottom of the ninth due up for the tigers santiago , granderson , monroe kiger takes over at second for jimenez street still in and he faces marcus thames , pinch hitting he flies out to kotsay one out this might be the time for nate roberston to start his rally chew , his version of the rally cap check out his blog for an explanation granderson drives and into right center but a hobbling bradley tracks it down shades of paul o neill several years back two out monroe doesn t add to his 3 hr tally , but he singles man on first , two out polanco singles into right , bradley cuts it off and keeps monroe at second men on first and second , two out ordonez , 0 for 2 in his career against street but those stats mean nothing he drills the ball over the leftfield fence home run they win 63 the tigers head to the world series and the tigers look like this year s red sox of 2004 game over tigers 6 , a s 3 top of ninth due up for the a s jimenez , kendall and kotsay bobby kielty pinch hits for jimenez but he pops it up to guillen one out kendall steps in against ledezma and he singles into left man on first , one out kotsay pop it up to monroe in left man on first , two out it s now a battle of the bullpens , and the tigers have to be given the nod on that score rodney and jones are still available \( and perhaps zumaya , if he s healthy \) , while street for the a s has already gone an inning and two thirds bradley , a switch hitter , comes to bat ledezma , a lefty , stays in and he gets bradley to fly deep to right ordonez catches it and we go the bottom of the ninth a s 3 , tigers 3 bottom of eighth due up for the tigers pudge , gomez , inge macha s move last inning was classic moneyball , a willingness to look past the conventional wisdom that you just use your closer in the 9th why not use him when the outcome is most in doubt , even if that is in the 7th inning \? thirty years ago , managers did not worry about keeping their closers fresh for the ninth goose gossage often came in during the seventh of course , he would then pitch the rest of the game and pudge is gone on a called third strike no one on , one out and street makes gomez look pathetic , striking him out with a pitch in the dirt two down and inge grounds one to short , scutaro to swisher and we go to the ninth , all tied up a s 3 , tigers 3 top of eighth due up for the a s bradley , thomas , chavez if you re watching the game and wondering why you haven t heard the words dead red dozens of times , that s because analyst steve psycho lyons , has been relieved of his duties for apparent insensitive remarks bradley singles to start of the eighth man on first , no one out bradley , despite hurting his thigh earlier this game , stays in thomas , still without a hit in this series , grounds into a double play , 463 two out leyland comes out to talk to grilli , and leaves him in chavez walks man on first , two out payton walks swisher then walks and after 12 straight balls later , the bases are loaded grilli is gone bases loaded , two out on for the tigers is ledezma ledezma is throwing 97 mph heat and he gets scutaro to pop up to pudge a s 3 , tigers 3 bottom of seventh due up for the tigers granderson , monroe , polanco kennedy still in for the a s and he gets granderson to lift a lazy fly ball to left one out calero , who came to the a s with haren in the mulder deal , gets loose in the bullpen monroe , who s got three postseason home runs this year , is walked man on first , one out polanco , who came over from the phillies last year , allowing chase utley to play regularly , has been a sparkplug for the tigers he singles into center men on first and second , one out macha trudges out to the mound and calero heads to the mound calero throws hard , one of the few pitchers with more strikeouts than innings pitched facing ordonez , he falls behind 31 count goes full , with a breaking ball on the inside corner and he walks the bases loaded , just in time for detroit s best hitter , guillen bases loaded , one out and macha turns to his closer , huston street , with the season on the line the fox promos for their entertainment shows seem to come more furiously than before while house is a hit , justice appears to be a goner , no matter how many teasers are shown \( and that s despite some great scenechewing acting by victor garber , one of the best broadway actors \) and street gets the double play , chavez stepping on the bag and going to swisher at first a s 3 , tigers 3 top of seventh due up for the a s scutaro , jimenez , kendall bonderman still on the mound , but the bullpen is active jamie walker and jason grilli warming scutaro hits one into the hole and short , and santiago makes a hard play look easy one out jimenez , signed originally by the yanks and then has bounced around with the padres , white sox and rangers , and playing only because ellis broke a finger , strikes out he s not happy with the ump piniella doesn t think he had much to complain about , and the replay backs him up too close to take two out bonderman still throwing gas , with pitches in the mid90s he vowed to make the a s pay after they traded him , and after a slow start , he may be making beane regret his move one other footnote from that trade the tigers had a choice harden or bonderman feeling harden was more advanced , beane picked bonderman to be the trade bait kendall then hits one off of bonderman into right man on first , two out and bonderman departs to an ovation from the crowd walker now in for the tigers the lefthanded hitting kotsay , one of the best defensive outfielders in the game , is also pretty good against lefties \( 265 this season \) he hammers one down the rightfield line , but just foul count is full breaking ball is fouled out of play strikes him out with another breaking ball a s 3 , tigers 3 bottom of sixth due up for the tigers ordonez , guiilen , rodriguez when the tigers signed ordonez to a fiveyear , 75 million deal before last season , the reaction was credulous coming off a knee injury and a nasty parting with the white sox , the consensus was the tigers were overpaying but magglio just hammered a hanging offspeed pitch into the left field stands and the game is tied a s 3 , tigers 3 guillen singles , and haren is on the ropes man on first , no out top of sixth ken macha comes out , and haren is gone joe kennedy comes in kennedy performed well this year as a long reliever , picking up 4 wins and posting an era of 231 in 39 games chavez redeems himself for his earlier error , going to his left , whirling and getting the man on first swisher makes a nice pick , too man on second , one out guillen catches the a s napping and steals third man on third , one out the lefthanded hitting gomez , facing a lefty , sees the count go full after getting ahead 30 and kennedy strikes him out man on third , two out and kennedy falls behind 30 again macha calls for the intentional walk men on first and third , two out santiago , playing only because casey is hurt , gets a pitch to drive but fouls the fastball down the middle off kendall s mask the count goes full and then he pops up to payton in left all tied up a s 3 , tigers 3 due up for the a s thomas , chavez , payton thomas , still looking for his first hit of the series , demonstrates one reason he s so valuable when he s not hurt , drawing a walk on four straight pitches man on first , none out on the first pitch , chavez hits a ground ball to guillen , who throws thomas out at second but chavez is safe man on first , one out an easy double play ball is turned into a fielder s choice , as polanco almost runs into santiago as he tries to turn the play himself man on first , two out swisher , who finally broke out of his series slump with his last at bat , got the pitch he was looking for on a 20 count but he fouls off the fastball he then hits a weak grounder to guillen , who steps on the bag and the a s are retired a s 3 , tigers 2 bottom of fifth due up for the tigers santiago , granderson , monroe as the fox crew talk about the revival of downtown detroit , and piniella talks about how things are starting to happen in detroit not sure he s been reading the business pages much lately chavez throws the ball away on inge s squibber down the third base line and there s now a runner on second with no out santiago moves the runner over with a nice piece of hitting man on third , one out leyland chats with the fox announcers , and says his team hasn t been taking good atbats but with the shadows no longer a problem , his team does seem to be doing a bit better against haren granderson shows more patience than typical at the plate and on a full count , he smacks a shot into right center and uses his speed to make it to second inge scores a s 3 , tigers 1 man on second , one out monroe lines the ball into left payton tries for a backhanded sliding catch and can t get it granderson scores a s 3 , tigers 2 man on second , one out polanco , who is 6 for 14 in his career against haren , lines to second , and jimenez easily doubles up monroe , who demonstrates some poor baserunning judgement but the tigers work haren over , getting his pitch count into the 80s and moving within one run a s 3 , tigers 2 top of fifth due up for the a s kendall , kotsay , bradley kendall , who s hit safely in his past five games , hasn t yet today he grounds out to short one out kotsay flies out to center field , and then slaps his bat in disgust two out bradley pops one up into right the a s go down in order but they still lead a s 3 , tigers 0 bottom of fourth due up for the tigers polanco , ordonez , guillen power pitching , as piniella and the crew said earlier , rules in the postseason and unlike much of the conventional wisdom repeated in the booth , this commentary has the virtue of being true as times contributor alan schwarz wrote a few weeks ago , in the postseason , velocity is destiny  but haren loses this battle with polanco , a postseason stalwart who singles into left one man on ordonez is jammed and pops up to the centerfielder kotsay one man on , one out pitch in the dirt , and polanco takes off for second kendall s throw not in time the fans in detroit start waving their towels in earnest , and guillen takes a walk men on first and second , one out haren starts pudge with a slider on outside corner , a different look strike one two more strikes , and pudge goes down on haren s seventh k of the game men on first and second , two out gomez , one of the heroes in game 2 of the series , gets sawed off by haren , and scutaro throws him out at first a s 3 , tigers 0 top of fourth due up for the a s chavez , payton , swisher first pitch , and chavez hits a lazy pop fly to granderson in center one out payton hits his first home run of the postseason , to left field in a spacious comerica park a s 3 , tigers 0 still hitless in the series , swisher almost gets his first hit , looping a ball into right , but it s just foul the son of former major leaguer steve swisher , nick does get that first hit with a line shot to right man on first , one out slow roller in the infield , inge scoops it up and throws out scutaro man on second , two out jimenez flies out a s 3 , tigers 0 bottom of third due up for the tigers santiago , granderson , monroe santiago , a lateseason callup for the tigers and someone not particularly known for his hitting prowess , bunts up the firstbase line , and haren easily throws him out one out haren continues breezing along , doing his best clemens impersonation , and he rings up granderson already with five strikeouts , all with the splitfinger fastball two out monroe looks helpless at the plate , too , falling behind 12 haren wastes a pitch outside fastball down the middle , as monroe looks for the splitter strikeout no 6 , and the tigers trudge out to the field a s 2 , tigers 0 top of third due up for the a s kendall , kotsay , bradley kendall goes down on three straight strikes , his second strike out of the game one out bonderman sure has settled down since the rough first there s no substitute for power pitching in the playoffs , as piniella just said and that conventional wisdom is right kotsay lines hard to ordonez in right two out a noticeably hurt bradley singles , and the fox crew speculates how much longer he can stay in the game man on first , two out thomas flies out , going to 0 for 12 in the series a s 2 , tigers 0 bottom of second due up for the tigers guillen , rodriguez , gomez guillen , who s moved over from short to first because of the injury to sean casey , strikes out third k of the game for haren one out pudge grounds out to scutaro at short two out gomez singles into right , the first hit for the tigers today man on first , two out pitch in the dirt , and gomez moves into scoring position but haren throws another nasty splitter and inge and the tigers are retired a s 2 , tigers 0 after two top of second due up for the a s swisher , scutaro , jimenez swisher , the first a s pick in the 2002 draft captured in moneyball , has no shortage of cockiness but he s not hitting this series and he flies out to left one out scutaro , playing short because former rookie of the year bobby crosby is hurt \( again \) , grounds out to first two out jiminez quickly grounds out , and we head to the bottom of the inning a s 2 , tigers 0 bottom of first the batting

both times kendall steps in and we re on our way kendall strikes out and kendall is not happy one out kotsay walks man on first , one out bradley has kept his emotions in check this season , after some unfortunate incidents in cleveland and los angeles and he has been one of the few a s who s hit this series count goes to 3 and 1 monroe leaps for the foul ball in the left field stands , but

tigers , playing like it s 1984 all over again , could sweep the a s in 4 and today s tigers starter , jeremy bonderman , might have a little more motivation than most in dispatching his opponent the hardthrowing righty , who pitched masterfully here at comerica last saturday to end the yankees season and set off a new york tabloid frenzy about joe torre s future , was discarded by the a s four years ago billy beane , the general manager of the a s and the focal point of michael lewis s brilliant moneyball , sent bonderman to the tigers in a threeteam deal that saw jeff weaver go to the yanks , ted lilly to the a s , and bonderman , carlos pena and franklyn german to the tigers bonderman s sin he was a pitcher drafted out of highschool such creatures drove beane to distraction back then , as he much preferred collegedrafted pitchers and their easiertopredict trajectories he apparently was so peeved when his scouting staff chose bonderman in the first round of the 2001 draft that he threw a chair at an office wall , according to the lewis book beane has since said he threw the chair for a different reason  bonderman has come a long way since a rough rookie season in 2002 , in which he avoided 20 losses only because his manager pulled him from the rotation after he hit 19 he s improved each season , and this year he was 148 with a 408 era during the regular season , with 202 strike outs , second only in the american league to johan santana standing in his and the tigers path to the world series dan haren he was acquired by beane two offseasons ago as he unloaded a soontobe free agent in mark mulder to the st louis cardinals for haren , kiki calero and daric barton haren has since delivered two 14 win seasons , and is considered like bonderman , he s 23 one of the best young pitchers in the game and , like bonderman , he throws hard \( 176 k s this season , sixth best in the al \) , and he s pitched well in the postseason now all he has to do is stop a

to the editor dr arnold s relman \( letter , may 4 \) , for whom i have great deal of respect , provides three reasons we should not just convert our entire health care system to medicare in his response to paul krugman s may 1 column but none of his concerns should stop us one is the necessity to cut rising costs but this applies regardless of what system we use second , he is correct that this could be paid for only by increasing tax revenue but that only replaces much higher amounts of money currently spent in insurance premiums , which are inflated by unnecessary overhead costs finally , it is true that this change would be ferociously resisted by the insurance industry , drug and device companies and providers but should we avoid taking such action to protect these interests to the detriment of our society \? herbert h keyser , md san antonio , may 4 , 2006 the writer is the author of a book about american health care
the page you are now reading is the beginning of an answer to an old riddle how can the editorial pages of the times be global and local at the same time \? until recently , our editorials and oped articles have been like a camera with four main settings world , nation , washington and new york the rest of the metropolitan region wound up in the awkward middle distance , popping into the frame sometimes , but not with the frequency or fine detail that our readers deserved the times will always speak with one editorial voice , but we 're expanding the opportunities for conversation as of today , new jersey will have its own editorial page every sunday we 've been wanting to do this for a long time , and to begin with , let s share some bedrock assumptions here are a few things we believe that new jersey is a place with a marvelous sense of identity while residents of new york city often have only the vaguest understanding that there s a state out there somewhere , people in new jersey are keenly aware not only of trenton , but also of the cities , counties , townships and boroughs whose problems or triumphs can often wash over into their neighbors' backyards that the region matters officials may squabble over which side of the hudson gets this office tower or that corporate headquarters , but on the ground , state lines dissolve the character of new jersey has a great deal to do with its proximity to the jobs and culture , high and low , created by new york city what s good for new york is good for new jersey usually that it s possible to be concerned about affordable housing and also worried about exurban sprawl that deer and bears are wonderful , but not so wonderful that none should ever be shot that people who must travel great distances to work by train or bus are ennobled by their suffering and deserve a decent ride and a designation more dignified than commuter that private property must be protected , but that the designation does not include a shoreline that is kept in existence by the taxpayerfinanced army corps of engineers that while the political culture in trenton could in some ways compare favorably to that in , say , albany , new jerseyans still suffer from bad government whether it is outright corruption or the series of deals and winks that led to failures from pension abuses to school construction scandals expect more such assertions in coming weeks letters and oped submissions are invited see the note on the right if you 're ready to send one now that we 're all here , let s start talking

the washington nationals' bus will depart the team complex in viera , fla , this morning for a game against the st louis cardinals with the expectations that alfonso soriano will be on it , ready and willing to play left field the question is whether soriano will acquiesce to the team s wishes , or if he will continue to resist , exacerbating a threemonth stalemate and increasing the likelihood of a showdown that could end with him on the disqualified list or with another team , possibly the mets soriano , who has played 762 of his 782 career games at second base and none in the outfield , has refused to play anything but second base , going as far as taking only a second baseman s mitt to spring training as a sign of defiance but jose vidro is entrenched at second base , and the nationals have no plans to shift him in favor of soriano , who has led second basemen in errors for each of the last five seasons and has committed 105 over all since 2001 the mets , despite their insistence that they are content with kazuo matsui or anderson hernandez at second base , have started snooping around to gauge whether they can snag soriano at a discount price combining soriano with carlos delgado , a mediocre defensive first baseman , would create a leaky right side of the infield but manager willie randolph , who knows soriano from their time together with the yankees and has lived with matsui s suspect defense , may be persuaded to accept soriano for the sake of more offense still , it is a long shot aside from the fact that the nationals may not want to trade soriano because they will not receive equal value , the biggest obstacle is that matsui , who has a partial notrade clause that prohibits his going to washington , has an 8 million salary that the mets wish they were not paying they are adamantly opposed to spending 18 million for two second basemen , one of whom would not play even if the nationals are willing to assume a significant portion of soriano s salary , the mets may not be willing to satisfy washington s need for an outfielder by surrendering victor diaz , a prime and inexpensive trading chip , and perhaps a reliever , which the nationals could use after luis ayala sustained a seasonending elbow injury in the world baseball classic for his part , soriano has said that he would prefer to play in the american league , where he is familiar with the pitchers he has also said he enjoys the recognition of being a powerhitting second baseman , a rarity , as opposed to being a powerhitting outfielder , of which there are dozens he set a record by receiving 10 million in arbitration during the offseason and is eligible for free agency after this season his market value will be affected by which position he plays after returning from the classic , where he went 0 for 12 for the dominican republic , soriano was penciled in as the leadoff hitter and left fielder in monday night s game against the dodgers he did not leave the dugout with the rest of his teammates , and for a few confusing moments , left field remained empty the nationals prefer that soriano plays today , but if he does not agree to by tomorrow , they plan to file a request with the commissioner s office to put him on the disqualified list , preventing him from receiving a paycheck or earning service time , a penalty rarely invoked doing so would not be a precedent in 1980 , the pittsburgh pirates placed bert blyleven on the disqualified list because he said he would retire unless he was traded , and in 1987 the houston astros did the same with dickie thon , who left the team in july and became a free agent at the end of the season michael weiner , the general counsel of the players union , was not prepared to say whether the union would file a grievance , but as long as the nationals are not asking soriano to do anything that will incur physical harm , it may be difficult to defend his refusal to play the outfield i 've talked to his representatives , and i'm still gathering information , weiner said in a telephone interview from phoenix we have to evaluate all of the circumstances players shift positions all the time , usually without complaining alex rodriguez moved to third base with the yankees to accommodate the incumbent shortstop , derek jeter , and craig biggio switched seamlessly among catcher , outfield and second base some of the mets' catcher moves , like the mike piazza experiment at first base or todd hundley s shift to left field , turned into disasters but a player as openly defiant as soriano is rare soriano is a charismatic personality and a popular figure in the clubhouse , often greeting reporters and teammates with fist bumps and smiles and calling everyone papi he has not been labeled as a malcontent but soriano is nothing if not stubborn after he was acquired from the yankees for rodriguez in february 2004 , soriano told the rangers that he was adamant about playing second base last may , soriano pouted when rangers manager buck showalter removed him from the leadoff spot and dropped him to fifth in the batting order soriano said he viewed himself more as a basestealing threat than as a power hitter despite consistently ranking among the american league leaders in home runs and strikeouts the nationals traded brad wilkerson , viewed as a face of their franchise , in a fourplayer deal for soriano in december , without being given permission to ask whether he would be amenable to moving to the outfield the team presumed he would defer to vidro now the nationals and soriano are at a crossroads the answer could come today photo when the nationals acquired alfonso soriano in a fourplayer deal in december , they presumed he would agree to move to the outfield \(

at 8 30 on a recent morning in west windsor , nj , ken anderson was sitting behind the wheel of his car , waiting patiently for a train to pull into the princeton junction station from new york he was not picking anyone up in what has become part of his daily hourlong commute into manhattan , mr anderson was staking out reverse commuters so he could grab a parking spot there s usually one or two people who get off the train and into their cars , and when one of their spots opens up , i make my move , said mr anderson , 34 , of hightstown , nj , who works as an accounts payable supervisor at atari to have any chance for a parking spot , you have to get here before 6 30 in the morning or after 8 for me , parking every day is an adventure earlier that morning , kristan flynn , a 34yearold research associate who lives in princeton , five miles from the station , sped into the parking lot on her bicycle no place to park , she said even the bike racks are nearly all full more than 7 , 000 people board commuter trains each day at the princeton junction station , but there are only enough parking spaces for about half of them , according to new jersey transit for mr anderson and the 3 , 767 other commuters who have applied for a permit through the west windsor parking authority , the wait can be as long as seven years , officials said another 2 , 833 from west windsor are on a twoyear waiting list for parking lots reserved for township residents commuters do n't have many alternatives at nearby stations thirteen miles to the south , the daily lot at the hamilton train station is filled by 6 30 am , and there are no available permits a few miles south , in trenton , the parking garage operator says the 90amonth specials are all taken , leaving commuters the option of paying 8 a day or 135 a month at a time when gov jon s corzine is pushing for the construction of another commuter rail tunnel under the hudson river , at a cost of 72 billion , transit and local officials have yet to address a longstanding problem even now there are not enough parking spaces and the problem is not unique to new jersey parking is a scarce commodity at many rail stations along the tracks operated by metronorth in westchester county and connecticut and by the long island rail road in nassau and suffolk counties in westchester , there are about 26 , 000 parking spaces for 75 , 000 commuters on long island , almost half of the parking lots are more than 95 percent full if we 're growing the commuter rail system , we have to grapple with how we are going to get people to the trains , said jon orcutt , the executive director of the tristate transportation campaign in new york , a mass transit advocacy group it s a major planning issue with towns across the metropolitan area yet , commuters without parking permits find themselves caught between municipalities reluctant to build parking garages and state transit agencies , like new jersey transit and new york s metropolitan transportation authority , which operates metronorth and the long island rail road , that have failed to keep up with the growing demand the names of many commuters still dreaming of a permit to call their own are on waiting lists longer than their vehicles in the meantime , people find themselves paying hefty fees at private lots and , at princeton junction , even offering nearby homeowners 100 a month to use their driveways gone are what transportation officials call the kiss and ride days , when wives dropped husbands off at the station and picked them up at night for many families , the parking crunch has created a hardship , particularly for those working parents who ca n't drop their children off at day care centers before 7 am or who would like to put their child on the school bus come september , but ca n't afford to wave goodbye because parking spots vanish just after dawn those who live too far to walk to train and bus stations have come up with assorted strategies , including getting there by bicycle , inline skating , even skateboards in new jersey and across the region , municipalities own and operate most of the parking lots at train stations this means that residents usually get parking permits before nonresidents it also means that municipalities can restrict the expansion of parking lots and throw up obstacles to proposed parking garages , often out of concern that additional spaces would attract more commuters from outside the community , leading to more traffic adding a big monolithic structure like a parking garage makes people from small towns feel like the bigcity boogeyman is coming , said darius sollohub , a professor at the new jersey institute of technology who heads the infrastructure planning program at the college s school of architecture it makes them feel that they have become too urban , that they are a city now and no longer a town , mr sollohub said it goes against the reasons for why they moved to a small town in the first place

i recently attended my graduation ceremony instead of walking across a stage , though , i walked halfway across a soccer field instead of a diploma , i was handed a single red rose and instead of my name being called out , it was my son s that was announced no 6 , midfielder paul lombardi he jogged over with the rose , leaned down to give me a hug and rejoined his team i went back to the bleachers with the other moms this ceremony is a school tradition during halftime of the last home game of the regular season , the seniors on the high school varsity soccer team put on this brief ritual a thankyou , an acknowledgment , for all those years , all that travel and all those hours on the sidelines we were retiring as soccer moms there is no bigger clich \? han soccer mom the term has a lot of pejorative connotations you know us we are those women who have nothing to do but drive our kids to practices and games , who live vicariously through our children s performance on the field , and who barrel down narrow roads in oversize vehicles while dispensing snacks and yammering on the cellphone naturally , i take exception to this stereotype i have never driven a minivan or an suv and hope to continue my adult life without ever doing so i have a career that interests me greatly and keeps me pretty busy there are only about six people who have my cellphone number , and it does n't even matter because i often forget to charge the phone , let alone turn it on what makes me a soccer mom is that i have a son who plays soccer and what makes me sad is that my career as a soccer mom is coming to an end sure , paul might play on a club or on an intramural team in college but i wo n't be there on the sidelines cheering and cheering is what i have been doing for more than a dozen years now for many suburban children , soccer begins in kindergarten , with those first american youth soccer organization teams the little boys and girls delicious in those jerseys that almost reach their knees play what i think of as swarm soccer that is , none of them has the remotest concept of playing a position they simply flock up and down the field along with the ball , wildly kicking whenever they get the chance , whether or not anyone on their team is there to receive it eventually , they start to get the hang of the game , though it does take awhile it was pretty common during those elementary school years for parent coaches to be yelling same team ! same team ! to a couple of teammates who were battling for possession of the ball there is also a learning curve for parents i do not want to admit how long it took me to master the concept of offsides by fourth grade , my son was playing on a travel team by the end of that first season , i was ready to put my odometer up against anyone s as a measure of parental devotion weekends were spent following vague directions to faraway fields the years went by , and as they did , there were lessons in the growth patterns of little boys turning into adolescents boys who had loomed over their teammates stopped growing in the seventh grade boys who were gangly and less coordinated came into their own and started exhibiting strong skills by middle school , pressure mounted for them to begin specializing in one sport , and soccer turned into a yearround proposition some quit we lost our best defender to the football team yes , i know i used the pronoun we my son s travel team stayed together until high school the moms and the dads did feel a part of it we spent a lot of time together we developed traditions every mother s day , we had a potluck brunch , and the moms would take on the boys in a scrimmage \( i recommend this to any parent who needs to be cured of poor sideline behavior you try playing soccer , and you will never again yell out instructions or criticisms \) with high school came more stressful tryouts and the inevitable cuts there were great coaches and difficult coaches there were overtime games played on artificial turf in driving rainstorms there were injuries there were marathon homework sessions that went well past midnight , because the players did n't get back from their weekday away games until 9 pm but boy , was there joy in watching them play for one thing , they got really good , and it was a pleasure to see them move the ball effortlessly up and down the field but i think what really made it special was that we watched this particular group of boys grow up together on the field a friend was recently putting together a photo album for the endoftheseason soccer dinner all the mothers rummaged through their old pictures there were gaptoothed first graders with one foot propped on a ball , and gawky middle schoolers with their arms around each other s shoulders the fourthgrade team picture was particularly poignant we thought they had really hit the big time on that first travel team the photo reveals them to be what they were smiling , skinny 9yearolds now they 're shaving their leg muscles are scary looking after practice , they work on their college applications they tower over the mothers who once helped them tie their cleats recently i tried to calculate how many soccer games i had attended , from paul s kindergarten days through the varsity playoffs hundreds my soccer mom rose sits in a vase on my desk i 'll probably press it in a book next year , i suspect there will be crisp fall afternoons that will feel hollow and lonely i know it s time for all of us to move on but it sure has been a wonderful run drawing \( drawing by alex nabaum \)

center lane , a community center for lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender adolescents , first opened here when adam frankel was 3 it was hard not to think about this the other afternoon during center lane s 10th anniversary celebration , as adam , 13 , spoke about being out at his school the party took place in the center s sunny new space , its walls decorated with colorful mottos like you are not alone and safe place dozens of boisterous teenagers mingled there with parents , social workers , politicians and county officials adam has large dark eyes and is still small enough that the microphone had to be lowered so he could be heard as i watched and listened , i was transported back to 1995 , when i covered center lane s opening there were at that time just five very frightened teenagers in a basement suite at the loft , a gay community center in downtown white plains none of them had told their parents where they were going , and there was certainly no fanfare no last names were to be used in the article i wrote about them they also asked if identifying details about their high schools could be omitted a decade ago , those students cat , joe and terek were the only ones who allowed even their first names to be used kept stressing how dangerous it would be for them to be revealed as lesbian or gay in the newspaper it was bad enough that people suspected cat , 16 , described being constantly harassed at her high school , where the football team in particular taunted her with epithets that mocked her sexual orientation and would yell , if you sleep with me one night , you 'll change ! she tried dating boys , she said , and when she confessed to her boyfriend that she was attracted to girls , he raped her joe , 19 , had things thrown at him in school while teachers looked on when terek broached the subject of being gay with his mother , she flipped out , he said , and told him to get a girlfriend all of this was revealed in anguished hushed voices back then even the administrators at center lane , a program of westchester jewish community services , were ambivalent about the coverage their support group was being criticized for promoting an immoral lifestyle so it is tempting to write about how radically life has changed for teenagers who struggle with their sexuality about how much easier it has become for them in school hallways and at home in many ways that is so in 1995 there were two high schools in the county with gaystraight alliances today there are 30 adam s parents accompanied him to the recent celebration many other parents were there as well when center lane opened , it ran one support group now there are several , as well as a daily afterschool dropin center , individual and family counseling and educational workshops sara braun , the director of center lane , says that the center serves 250 youths directly and reaches another 1 , 500 through antibullying and other educational programs in school a satellite branch has recently opened in yonkers but as relaxed as most of the teenagers seemed in the room , life on the outside is still not that easy , particularly depending on where you live we 're finding that in white middle and uppermiddleclass communities , they 're giving lip service to the idea that we should be supportive to gay kids , ms braun said but homophobia is still alive and well kids from the islands are still getting thrown out of their houses , and you ca n't be gay in mount vernon indeed , when marino flores , a senior at roosevelt high in yonkers , came out not long ago , he was bullied and had bottles thrown at him in the hallways these things happened in front of staff and they did n't take any action , he said their attitude was , 'it s just kids being kids' center lane counselors urged marino to take the problem to his principal at first i did n't want to complain , he said you think by keeping your silence it s going to get better , but it gets worse things were n't much better at home marino said of his father he s mexican and he s all macho he still denies it he s still introducing me to girls adam could only speculate about how much things had changed over the last decade i guess it s easier and more acceptable than it was 10 years ago , he said , but you still really do n't know how people are going to react the amount of fear is so overwhelming no matter how supportive society is , it s still a huge , huge thing drawing \( drawing by nancy doniger \)
when it comes to garage sales , everyone has a strategy shop early for selection shop late for bargains bring a list or let serendipity prevail i'm from the undisciplined serendipity school , which means i have wasted a lot of money over the years i once bought a huge wooden toboggan , only to find that it turned up regularly on the local garage sale circuit buyers would ride it downhill once , realize they could not pull it back uphill and sell it the next summer we did the same but the garagesale fates have also bestowed upon me some of my favorite possessions a footstool with bull seye trim , a stately pair of saltandpepper shakers , an eerie print of a centuryold indoor swimming pool none of them are treasures of an antiques roadshow sort all of them make me smile this year , though , i resolved to take an entirely new approach to our townwide garage sale day i was not going to acquire things at all i was going to shop for stories two experiences inspired me the first was writing a book about a gold coin that sold at auction in 2002 for 76 million the coin was a beauty of surpassing rarity , but its real value was its singular history not the object itself , but the story attached to it the same is true , i came to understand , for most possessions , albeit on a completely different scale without a story , our things are just stuff the second was a box i found in the hallway of an estate sale i visited last winter the box was filled with a dozen completed needlepoint canvases i was heartbroken how could it be that no one cared to keep these reminders of the woman who had stitched them \? i 've never stopped wishing i had asked about her my garage sale quest was an apology to her i was n't asking for a 7 million saga , just some evidence of love here in sea cliff , garage sale day is a giddy affair of crowded sidewalks , overexcited children and dogs confused by exotic smells i joined the throng with a notebook instead of a wallet at my first stop i picked up a copy of tom swift and his electric locomotive by victor appleton , inscribed to bud from wylie , 12 23 28 to my disappointment , my neighbor had no idea who bud and wylie were , nor how the book had turned up at her house some things are just mysteries , she said very true , especially at garage sales farther along i paused at a box of 30yearold archie comic books i loved these things , the seller told me i 'd read them for hours me too , as i had just been telling my daughter i broke my own rule and bought one in another yard a pair of gray metal stools caught my eye they 're from a diner , the seller said i bought them for my son , who has a place in chinatown , but they 're pretty unwieldy to bring on the train i asked if she had been a regular at the diner no , i bought them from a dealer in southampton , she said that was a story , but not what i was looking for i heard endless explications of the usual garagesale themes children growing up , home redecoration , hobbies that did n't quite work out i feared tragedy at a friend s house when i spotted a collection of empty fish tanks for sale , but learned to my relief that the family turtle , a redeared slider , had outgrown a succession of tanks he was now living in a monstersized enclosure we picked it up at a garage sale , my friend said so we 're selling these the circle of life , garage salestyle in the shadow of a russian orthodox church i saw an enormous , beatup stainedglass portrait of a crusading knight on horseback with hallelujahs from the church drifting overhead , the seller told me that he had rescued the knight from the renovation of a hotel in midtown manhattan i sensed money , not love , had been his motive my quest continued i walked down a steep hill and came upon a smiling couple , sitting in matching beach chairs at the lip of the cleanest garage i have ever seen i marveled aloud we 're compulsive , the woman explained more than ever as we get older you think more \? her husband replied i think less their offerings were sparse but the banter was irresistible i picked up an old tennis racket , wooden , with a tiny head it was in immaculate shape it s a davis , 40 years old at least , he said these were real popular then did you play \? oh , yeah he kept talking , but i glanced at her her face seemed to glow with the memory of his playing tennis with this racket decades ago it was a talisman of their long marriage , an object that reflected contentment so powerfully that even a stranger could see it thanks , i said , carefully replacing the racket on the table i had my story
two new approaches to weight loss are up for review by federal regulators and they represent vastly different solutions to the nation s obesity epidemic for consumers and for the companies behind the drugs one , called acomplia , would be a prescription pill to control appetite by blocking the same brain receptors that stimulate the munchies in marijuana smokers some financial analysts see acomplia as the most promising new drug of the year , and they predict multibilliondollar sales eventually for its maker , the french company sanofiaventis the other , with the proposed name alli , is a weightloss drug that works by blocking the body s absorption of fat since 1999 it has been sold in the united states as the prescription medication xenical glaxosmithkline is proposing an overthecounter version , a prescriptionquality alternative to the diet remedies available in drugstore aisles and over the internet glaxo plans to draw on some of the same marketing techniques it used in 1996 , when it successfully commercialized nicorette chewing gum and nicoderm skin patches , which had formerly been sold only by prescription but the history of xenical , which was introduced by roche in the united states seven years ago to rosy wall street forecasts that never fully materialized , may be a cautionary tale for sanofi and its acomplia cheerleaders if approved , acomplia and alli would be the first new developments in weightloss medicine since the late 1990 s an estimated 200 other possibilities are in the research pipeline as companies seek an elusive cure for obesity none of the others , however , is close to regulatory review advocates for the obese and overweight , a group that now includes twothirds of the american population , hope that the overthecounter availability of alli and the approval of acomplia will provide new options , and suggest that the drugs might even be used together by patients who want help losing weight i think if we could get obesity treatments to a situation like cholesterol where there are several different products , where one or two in combination might be successful , at least that would arm physicians with more than they have now , said morgan downey , executive director of the american obesity association , a patients' advocacy group in washington the food and drug administration has scheduled an advisory panel hearing for jan 23 to review alli and the fda could make its decision on acomplia as soon as next month both drug companies are seeking approval in a difficult regulatory environment , as the fda is moving cautiously in the wake of the vioxx debacle any diet drug is up against a backdrop of safety issues from the past most notably problems with the diet drug combination fenphen fenfluramine , the fen half of the combination , was withdrawn from the market in 1997 after it was found to cause heart damage xenical has shown itself to be moderately effective and has a long safety record but alli a name the company has proposed because the drug must be allied with a weightloss program faces the higher hurdle required when prescription drugs are proposed for sale without a doctor s oversight you have to not only provide data that shows it s safe , you have to show that it s safe when it s misused , said gerald meyer , a former fda associate commissioner as the fda weighs glaxo s proposal , the company is proposing that its sales be restricted to adults 18 and over to prevent misuse by teenagers and yet , a factor that limits alli s potential for overuse is its tendency to cause flatulence , diarrhea or even sudden loss of bowel control those side effects are among the reasons xenical has never lived up to analysts' original forecasts worldwide sales quickly rose to nearly 750 million in 1999 , the first year xenical was available in the united states as patients realized it was not an obesity cureall , though , sales fell off and now hover at about 500 million a year worldwide , mainly outside the united states as regulators assess acomplia from sanofi , analysts see a positive sign in the fact that , as the february date for fda action on the drug approaches , the agency has not yet announced a hearing by an advisory panel of experts that could mean regulators have no serious reservations about the drug in medical conferences , sanofi has presented data that shows that acomplia is not just a weightloss drug but also a way to control a constellation of disorders high cholesterol , high blood pressure and elevated blood sugar that frequently accompany obesity the only other weightloss drug approved for longtem use is meridia , introduced by abbott laboratories in 1997 some doctors have avoided using it because of its link to increased blood pressure , one of the reasons for its tepid sales according to ims health , meridia had total united states sales in 2004 of 72 million xenical s united states sales in the same year were 102 million , ims said worldwide sales of xenical were about 500 million , according to roche , which licensed the drug to glaxo for overthecounter marketing
in his newsweek column , fareed zakaria says that zarqawi s death makes him just a bit hopeful about the future of iraq but zakaria s depressing conclusion , comparing 1990 s south africa to presentday iraq , seems to emphasize the just a bit part of that formulation he writes imagine if after the fall of apartheid in south africa , the black majority had come to power and decided to dismantle the entire apparatus of the afrikaner state let s say they disbanded the army , which had slaughtered them , and then fired all the whites in the civil service the result would have been chaos , a dysfunctional state , and in all probability the rise of an afrikaner insurgency but they did none of that on the contrary , the anc was extraordinarily forgiving , reassuring white south africans that they would have an important place in the new south africa as a result , south africa has been more politically stable and economically successful than anyone would have predicted in 1994 zakaria concludes that to build a stable political order , it will take more than just an iraqi military it will take an iraqi mandela
richard griffiths , the history boys richard griffiths s hector , the intellectual and idiosyncratic professor in alan bennett s history boys , does n't have much need for props the problem with the character is that none of the props amount to anything , mr griffiths said everything is in his head but he does allow that one item , the whacking book , with which he smacks his students , is disintegrating from use it looks like toffee that s been broken up , he said it s the only book i can use , because it s very soft but the nice thing about it is , it gives a terrific sound and it does n't hurt when he swings , it is n't a book that he is thinking of , though i think of it as the fish , he said , a fresh , wet , twopound salmon that anyone over 50 could use to slap young and beautiful people with everything laid at their feet cellphones , ipods and 200 sneakers he added they are painful to watch when i use the book , i think of that fish , and i smack them with it with great gusto , and they have no idea they think i am tapping them over the head with a book the gesture reflects an aspect of hector s character it s just a slice , really , just a facet on a diamond , mr griffiths said hector is a man who is easily underestimated he s probably a man who is a bit of a seditionist he does n't like authority by instinct he would side with the poets and artists , and he does n't care for formalities in the system he s a maverick in a very unlikely way phoebe hoban photo \( photographs by sara krulwich the new york times \)
we should have known conservative heffalump academy voters would have rather different ideas of what was stirring contemporary culture roughly 6 , 000 film industry voters , most in the los angeles area , many living cloistered lives behind wroughtiron gates or in deluxe resthomes , out of touch not only with the shifting larger culture and the yeasty ferment that is america these days , but also out of touch with their own segregated city , decide which films are good and rumour has it that lions gate inundated the academy voters with dvd copies of trash excuse me crash a few weeks before the ballot deadline next year we can look to the awards for controversial themes on the punishment of adulterers with a branding iron in the shape of the letter a , runaway slaves , and the debate over free silver when baseball returned in 95 , the game needed something to boost its performance , juice its attendance and muscle up its fan base the obvious answer was more home runs never has a sport , from its executive suites to its union , been so mutually complicit in its own moral contamination after the black sox scandal of 1919 , the game merely juiced its ball , promoting the home runs of babe ruth and others but from the sport s return in 95 until the bay area laboratory cooperative scandal two years ago , baseball looked the other way as sluggers put dangerous or illegal substances into their bodies regrettably , the network is not letting online viewers watch the games that are being shown on their local tv stations the restriction may be unavoidable because of the network s deals with its affiliates , but it s irrational given the choice between watching a game on tv or on a computer monitor , no one would choose the latter instead , the limit merely cuts off fans who want to watch the local games but can t reach a tv set
from gowns to programs to tiaras , the display windows at the sheraton atlantic city convention center hotel are chockfull of miss america memorabilia in the lobby , a video drones on day and night with shrieks and cries , hugs and waves , from the winning moments of pageants past while outside , a lifesize statue of bert parks , the longtime pageant mc , croons the theme song , there she is , at the press of a button inside the sheraton which stands apart in this resort city , about a halfmile from the boardwalk and the updated shopping district of the new atlantic city is another link to the past , the headquarters of the miss america organization and its 14 paid employees these days , with the pageant having fled to las vegas this year , the activity has the texture of a forlorn backoffice operation only a little more than a year since the last pageant here , miss america appears all but forgotten in her longtime home indeed , even when a recording of mr parks singing there she is was played after jennifer berry , miss oklahoma , was crowned in las vegas , a line referring to atlantic city the dreams of a million girls who are more than pretty may come true in atlantic city was excised there may be some people who have an emotional investment in miss america , and i feel sorry for them , but , really , virtually no one missed having the pageant here this year , said joe weinert , an editor at gaming industry observer , a trade magazine that monitors casinos here miss america has already been replaced by fancy shopping and good restaurants , and whatever is next will not include her in fact , earlier this month a week after she was crowned ms berry showed up to be memorialized at the walk , a new collection of outlet stores along michigan avenue where there are plaques commemorating each miss america but with the attention of only a few spectators , the questions arose why bother \? perhaps it was because the balmy september mornings when the postpageant pomp included a surfside romp was replaced by the february cold , or more likely it was apathy and lethargy in a town that is bent on reinventing itself and not willing to be bogged down by a past that deserted it it s nice to have them here , said jeff vasser , executive director of the atlantic city convention and visitors authority atlantic city is still the official home of the miss america organization , but winning the contract to have the atlantic 10 conference basketball tournament next year will do as much for us as miss america mr vasser is not without his own interest in miss america s legacy here in fact , his mother was miss atlantic city in 1954 , and when the pageant was first televised , she was the first person viewers saw , as the camera focused on her while she showed off her native city yet even mr vasser noted that during the midseptember weekend when the pageant would have been in full swing atlantic city had three conventions that drew more than 7 , 000 people who otherwise might not have been in town this is not to say that certain segments did n't feel an impact with miss america not here , florists , for instance , and maybe smaller local restaurants , he said but the convention business was good , and the casinos had a much better september 2005 than 2004 in a sense , even art mcmaster , the chief executive of the miss america pageant , acknowledged that atlantic city s ties to miss america were inexorably fraying , adding that while it was not certain whether the pageant would return to las vegas next year , it certainly would not be held in atlantic city we have about 20 cities bidding on the pageant now , mr mcmaster said , but none of them is atlantic city the sheraton is the home of our organization there is no reason to move , since we have to be someplace 50 weeks out of the year and it might as well be here , but to put the pageant on here is a financial problem so i do n't see it happening in the foreseeable future leonard c horn , who was the pageant s chief executive for 11 years before retiring in 1999 , said he feared that miss america fumbled its latest chances for revival and that atlantic city might be better off without it anyway they got a lot of press coverage just for the move to las vegas , so they generated a lot of publicity , mr horn , an atlantic city native , said in a telephone interview from his home in tennessee but ultimately , he said , the telecast was mundane and did not attract a lot of viewers 31 million on country music television compared with nearly 10 million the previous year on abc that publicity wo n't be there next year , and then what will they do \?

with his team clinging to the eighth and final western conference playoff spot with only five weeks left in the regular season , edmonton oilers general manager kevin lowe was busy as last thursday s trading deadline approached but at what cost \? on wednesday , lowe acquired the 36yearold goaltender dwayne roloson from minnesota for edmonton s firstround pick in this summer s entry draft on thursday , lowe obtained the 27yearold left wing sergei samsonov , the 1997 rookie of the year , from boston for a secondround pick in the draft , as well as forwards marty reasoner and yan stastny considering that he swapped a firstround pick and a secondround pick in two days for two players who are eligible for free agency after the season , one had to wonder if lowe was trading for the present at the expense of his team s future at 32229 and 73 points , the oilers led anaheim by 3 points for the final playoff spot in the west entering saturday s games if the oilers can get in the playoffs , can they do some damage with the moves they made \? of course , we would n't have done it if we did n't think we had a chance , lowe , who won five stanley cups with the oilers and another with the rangers , said friday by telephone but we 've really stockpiled a lot of young players we have five or six a prospects in our system and a whole lot of b s and c s plus , we still have an additional secondround pick in the draft so , really , we gave up our firstround pick in a weak draft , which will probably be anywhere from no 18 to 22 we just felt it was worth the risk this time inconsistent goaltending has plagued the oilers all season they entered friday ranked 19th in the 30team league with a 313 goals against average hence the trade for roloson , who allowed 5 goals on 31 shots thursday in his edmonton debut , a 52 loss to san jose considering roloson s age and his impending status as an unrestricted free agent this summer , many people around the league felt that lowe gave up too much with the firstround pick but lowe is not alone in his belief that this summer s draft is thin would we have still done it if it was a strong draft \? lowe said if it was a strong draft , then maybe a secondround pick would have done it for risebrough lowe was referring to minnesota general manager doug risebrough roloson was not the only goaltender available in an exchange of goalies , montreal traded the injured jos \? h \? ore to colorado for david aebischer edmonton s closest northwest division rival , the vancouver canucks , obtained mika noronen from buffalo for a secondround pick this summer entering saturday s games , the canucks who lost their no 1 goaltender , dan cloutier , to a torn anterior cruciate ligament in late november led the oilers by 3 points for the seventh spot in the west but noronen , who was buffalo s no 3 goaltender , has played in only four games this season and none since dec 2 and roloson , although 36 , was younger than the two biggestname goaltenders that might have been available at the deadline phoenix s curtis joseph and toronto s ed belfour neither joseph , 38 , nor belfour , 40 , ended up being traded he s a pretty darn good goalie , lowe said of roloson and if this goes well , we should be able to sign him for a few years samsonov , who scored 20 or more goals in four of his seven seasons in boston , had 18 goals and 19 assists in 55 games for the bruins this season photos dwayne roloson gave up five goals in his debut with the oilers last week \( photo by lou dematteis reuters \) vancouver acquired mika noronen from buffalo for a secondround pick in the draft \( photo by david duprey associated press \)
when the lobsters were wiped out in the western long island sound almost overnight in september 1999 , it was a devastating bolt from the blue for a 100 million industry now the lobstermen have achieved something almost as unlikely winning millions of dollars in compensation for their losses from chemical companies last week , just before the case was to go to trial , the lobstermen reached a tentative settlement in a classaction suit against cheminova , the maker of a pesticide called fyfanon based in wayne , nj the company agreed to pay 125 million the settlement will be taken before judge thomas platt of the united states district court in central islip , ny on monday two manufacturers of a different pesticide that were also named in the suit settled with the lobstermen in december 2004 , agreeing to pay a total of 375 million fyfanon was sprayed widely in new york city and long island in september 1999 to kill adult mosquitoes and combat a newly emerging public health threat , the west nile virus fyfanon s active ingredient , malathion , is highly toxic to lobsters according to the lawsuit , heavy rains from the remnants of hurricane floyd then washed fyfanon into the sound over a period of a few days , killing off the lobsters and idling several hundred commercial lobstermen nicholas crismale of guilford , president of the connecticut commercial lobstermen association , said he had reservations about the settlement , but would back it it was probably the prudent thing to do , he said am i satisfied \? no i do n't really believe the sum is substantial enough to compensate the lobstermen of long island sound or to correct the damage to the resource i would have liked to have seen it through because i think we could have definitely proven damages , he said but a lot of lobstermen could use the money now he added that a large damage award resulting from a jury trial would have been tied up in appeals for years the tentative settlement relieves gladstone n jones iii , the lobstermen s lawyer , of the need to prove in court that the dieoff was linked to the pesticide lawyers familiar with environmental cases said that establishing such a link is very hard mr jones called the settlement with cheminova a compromise to end a hardfought battle anywhere in the country , these cases are very difficult , and it was unpredictable what the outcome would be , he said a compromise is sometimes better than taking a case like this the final yard the lobster case was further complicated by conflicting scientific opinion at a symposium on the lobster dieoff held at stony brook university in october 2004 , scientists cited high water temperatures , low levels of dissolved oxygen , and other pollutants like ammonia and sulfides as possible contributing factors none named malathion as a clear culprit , though several researchers said more study of the chemical s role was needed mr jones , a partner in the jones , verras freiberg law firm in new orleans , said that the research presented at the symposium was flawed and that he had experts ready to testify at the trial that malathion was to blame cheminova denied that its pesticide was responsible for the lobster dieoff a lawyer for the company , christopher kelly of haight , gardner , holland knight in manhattan , said it agreed to settle the suit to avoid the expense and uncertainty of a trial and possible appeals he said cheminova had made no admission of liability whatsoever lawyers with experience in the field said that environmental contamination cases present enormous hurdles for plaintiffs , especially when they turn on injuries to people rather than to animals or crops james p rigano , a partner at certilman , balin , adler hyman in hauppauge , ny said it was extraordinarily rare for such claims to even reach court , much less succeed there proving the connection between exposure to a chemical and a real effect is very , very difficult , given the state of science , mr rigano said the only successful bodilyinjury actions i have seen were in the movies victor j yannacone jr of yannacone yannacone in patchogue , ny said the rigors of assembling and presenting scientific evidence of injuries dissuaded many lawyers from taking such cases you have to have wellorganized evidence , solid scientific data and vigorous advocacy by attorneys who are capable of dealing with both the science and the law , said mr yannacone , a pioneer in environmental law who represented vietnam war veterans exposed to the defoliant agent orange a classaction suit against the makers , including dow chemical and monsanto , was settled for 180 million in 1984 the financial risks of pressing such suits can be large for both the plaintiffs and the lawyers , who must shoulder court costs and get nothing unless they eventually win a settlement mr yannacone said that a groundbreaking 1966 suit he brought against the use of ddt for mosquito control in suffolk county cost me everything i had , 585 , 000 out of pocket most environmental groups cannot afford to sue that way going to court is way beyond our budget , said adrienne esposito , executive director of citizens campaign for the environment in farmingdale , ny when you look at the history , these kinds of cases take years and years , and cost multimillions she added , it has nothing to do with the merit of the cases it is rare for a government agency to positively identify one property as the source of contamination affecting another more often , the evidence is suggestive rather than definitive , making a successful suit unlikely sometimes , though , the evidence is overwhelming in 1994 , northville industries of melville , ny agreed in a consent order to pay 15 million to the state and 10 million to the suffolk county water authority for a huge leak of more than a million gallons of gasoline from a storagetank terminal in east setauket the company , which found and reported the leak in 1987 , also settled for an undisclosed amount with nearby homeowners who sued over vapors entering their homes photo equipment stored in huntington by lobstermen , who reached a settlement in a suit against a chemical firm \( photo by barton silverman the new york times \)
as a secondary teacher , i face many daunting tasks at the first of every school year , but certainly the first priority is getting acquainted with my approximately 150 new students and not just their names no , i need to know a little about these teenagers enough to make the initial connection that i hope to build on throughout the next nine and a half months teenagers are hesitant to reveal anything about themselves to anyone outside their comfortable peer group , let alone an adult in authority during my 28 years a teacher , i have tried many methods to initiate contact with my students letters exchanged , icebreaker activities , interviews none have worked as well for me as poetry using a poem and asking students to model the poem with one of their own allows me to trick them into revealing facets of their lives to me this year with my three classes of seniors , i used langston hughes poem theme for english b the speaker of the poem writes to his instructor as part of an assignment and searches to find truth and his place in the class we discuss what we learn about the speaker through his poem , then , i ask my students to go home and write a poem like hughes poem , only about their own lives this news is met with predictable groans but by the next class period nearly everyone has completed a poem i read my poem to them first so they can discover something about my heritage , my family , my hopes for the class then i ask them to read their poems to the other students at their table this sharing is an important first step toward the collaboration and discussion that will be the cornerstone of our class this year finally , they hand me their poems and i take them home to read that night i want to introduce you to some of my seniors using their own words i ve not edited the misspellings or grammatical errors because i want you to hear their voices as they reveal glimpses of who they are i was born in a place with a since of intimidation i m a young black man living on the north side of wichita , kansas where crime was bad so the bus ride home goes fast as i write my poem to make time pass i look out my window , down at the street to think about what makes me unique is it my style \? maybe even my smile or the person i grew up to be due to my experiences as a child these words were written by a tall , quiet , young man who seldom looks up to make eye contact with me i was surprised to find that he still rides the bus as a senior most of his peers are either driving or riding with friends i wonder if he has many friends i picture him writing his poem on the bus instead of talking with others he strikes me now as a solitary person who is unfailingly polite to everyone wichita north is an urban high school with around 1800 students over twothirds of our students come from families living at the poverty level and many will be firstgeneration high school graduates we are one of the most diverse high schools in kansas , and our school is rich with traditions and loyal alumni our staff and students have worked hard to establish pride in our school another young man whose father is a teacher at our school describes this pride and tradition best he \( father \) also went to north and so did my grandfather this school means more to me than it does to most students it s not just a school it is a tradition in my family and i m so proud to be part of it i m a small part of this school but this school is a big part of me i also discover that i have students new to wichita and to north high one girl is adjusting to a major culture shock having just moved from a small town in eastern kansas that she describes as the little farm town , very peaceful and slow everyone knows everybody to the freckles on their faces not surprising that i found her sitting alone in the corner on the first day until i moved her to join others yet another girl has moved back and forth between wichita and minnesota for the past several years i m not sure what the family circumstances are that have necessitated the frequent moves , but i do know from her poem that she has struggled as a result minnesota it s not easy to start over , leaving everything you know and everyone you love everything is changing too fast i can t catch up before it all changes again and then there is the poignant one from a child , who like so many of our students at north , is a child of recent immigrants to the united states many of whom are undocumented these students hover on the periphery of our attention afraid to be noticed because awareness leads to arrest and deportation it s not easy to know what is true for me , a hispanic girl in this new country united states i guess being hispanic doesn t make me different from any other american student i know that it is impossible to know what the future will bring for you or even for me in this place in which we are spending our life wichita a young lady who appears to be a middle class child writes one of the most surprising poems her poem reminds me of the dangers of first impressions and the fact that many of these students have lives they work hard to hide i m five foot two i m blonde , i have a tattoo on my right shoulder my eyes are blue and i m 17 years of age that s all fact but that s not what you want is it \? you want to know me let s see i have 3 brothers , an addict mother and a distant father at one point i lived days wandering where i m going to sleep or what i m going to eat i ve spent time and money messing my head up getting lost in the trend or is that too deep for you \? i think i will have a very interesting year with her one poem that clutches my heart is from a young man who has already joined the marines and plans to go to boot camp right after graduation he is proud of his decision and speaks with pride about his future at every opportunity his poem is the first time he mentions his worries it s hard to determine what is the truth from the bulls that s free at my age what i feel , see , and hear is my life , my dreams i can hear the bombs already gunshots , screams , bullets and wounded marines my fear comes out in this page i fear for him , too i want this year to be special for him since his future will hold so much danger and death then , two girls one hispanic , the other african american write of their lives neither talks to the other and i m not sure they even know each other , yet they share a common goal i will make sure that these two girls work together they have much to offer each other i m saddened that children have to fight such difficult battles when they are so young the first writes i wonder if tears are easy to write pain , crying scared for my life never knowing what is right hating not knowing what s coming my way only one thing keeping me here dreams shooting for the stars and the second been through things that most haven t i like to learn and listen i m wise enough to know what s true when times get tough i like to run i dribble with ball cause it s my game test me i ll knock you down petite and mean , that s who i am been told i would never make it look at me young dumb but about to have a degree swallow your words i reach for the next poem with some trepidation already this young lady and i have had problems in class a simple matter of her testing her boundaries but the problem has the potential of becoming a major disruption earlier that day , i didn t think i d miss her if she left i read her poem and have a better understanding of her issues perhaps she ll stay the year with our class her senior year will be her last chance i have lived in many houses in wichita i ve lived here and there , there and here i have lived nearly everywhere in wichita , ks i never finished a full year at one school life is never as simple as it first seems as every year , i m amazed at the honesty and hope in the poems i make sure to write notes in response to their poems , which begins our journey of discovery of each other i will learn more about each of their lives as we read , write and talk this year there are so many more poems and students that i wish i had space to share with you not all are sad or painful but most are kids today have to grow up in a more hazardous world than those of past generations the issues and choices they grapple with are so severe yet , they are still kids , still searching for their own identity and still hoping for the best i d like to end with the poem that captures a positive note for our school year you will help me prepare to be confident in myself to reach the goals i plan to reach we as a team will make it through because you re a part of me as i am a part of you therefore color doesn t make you who you are makes you who you are
there have been 34 school shootings in the united states in the last 10 years , resulting in the deaths of 54 students and 14 teachers , administrators and others , according to a timeline on www infoplease com none in new jersey but in hawthorne last month , prosecutors determined that an oral threat by a 16yearold student to shoot his principal , vice principal and fellow students at hawthorne high school , and to blow up the school , was sufficiently serious to file criminal charges against the teenager there was no evidence that the boy meant to carry out the threat , which was uttered on sept 22 after the principal and vice principal intervened in an argument the boy was having with another student , said michael o shea , passaic county s chief assistant prosecutor the youth , a junior , was suspended pending the outcome of a psychiatric evaluation and is being homeschooled , mr o shea said if found to be delinquent guilty , in juvenile court parlance he could be compelled to undergo counseling , placed in his parents' custody or held for up to two years in a juvenile jail the incident , which was not publicized by officials , was reported last week by the record the boy s name was withheld because he is a juvenile apparently , it was an emotional outburst , said mr o shea , who noted that it occurred before the shootings last monday at an amish schoolhouse in pennsylvania and other recent incidents in wisconsin and colorado , and was not a copycat case however , in this day and age , mr o shea said , schools and police must respond with extreme caution , and that s what they did steve strunsky
macaroni and cheese is just the kind of allamerican , oldfashioned home cooking i was not raised on new york city in the 1970 s was a hotbed of culinary radicalism foodforward parents like mine served dinners of homemade falafel , mediterranean fish stew or stirfried beef with broccoli to me , dishes like spaghetti and meatballs , mashed potatoes with gravy and macaroni and cheese seemed exotic and unattainable naturally , this is where my greatest passions lie as a cook and after the frenzy of holiday cooking , a simple dish like macaroni and cheese is just what i want to make now lacking a family recipe , i turned to cookbooks for guidance a strange substance called white sauce cropped up again and again bread crumbs , worcestershire sauce and alien cheeses like smoked gouda and parmigiano also kept finding their way in none of the recipes came close to my fantasy of what the dish should be nothing more than tender elbows of pasta suspended in pure molten cheddar , with a chewy , goldenbrown crust of cheese on top while reading the following passage in a 20yearold cookbook called simple cooking , the problem became clear a good dish of macaroni and cheese is hard to find these days the recipes in most cookbooks are not to be trustedusually it is their vexatious infatuation with white sauce , a noxious paste of flourthickened milk , for this dish flavored with a tiny grating of cheese contrary to popular belief , this is not macaroni and cheese but macaroni with cheese sauce it is awful stuff and every cookbook in which it appears should be thrown out the window the book s author , john thorne , still adheres to this position , but said that he has largely given up the fight starting at about the turn of the 20th century , there was a huge fashion for white sauce in america chafingdish stuff like chicken \? a king , or creamed onions , he said last week they were cheap and seemed elegant , and their legacy is that people choose 'creamy' over everything else but i maintain that macaroni and cheese should be primarily cheesy marlena spieler , author of a forthcoming book , macaroni and cheese \( chronicle \) , agreed that most recipes simply do not have enough cheese i believe in making a cheese sauce and also using shredded cheese , she said but she refuses to forgo white sauce altogether you need a little goo to keep the pasta and cheese together , she said having made a global study of the subject , she ticked off a list of alternative binders mascarpone , cr \? fra \? e , eggs , heavy cream , egg yolks , cottage cheese , butter and evaporated milk , which she deems a little too sweet but delightfully trashy like me , ms spieler believes that macaroni and cheese , which is often served alongside fried chicken or barbecue , deserves pride of place as a main dish i love it so much that i want to focus on it , she said a crisp green salad and a glass of wine turn mac and cheese into a meal , she added i first made mr thorne s recipe , a step in the right direction it combines a whole pound of cheddar cheese with half a pound of macaroni but the method , which entails taking the dish out of the oven every five minutes to stir in more cheese , is tiresome and so , armed with the knowledge that a seemingly outrageous 2 1 ratio of cheese to macaroni is indeed possible , i set out in search of the ideal recipe at cheese counters across new york city , complex blends of pungent , unaged , rindwashed and caveripened cheeses have been devised for makers of macaroni and cheese rob kaufelt , who owns murray s cheese in greenwich village , counsels a 305020 blend of swiss gruy \? , young irish cheddar and parmigianoreggiano , or a blend of english cheddars at artisanal , cooks are steered toward the softness of italian fontina and welsh caerphilly these are all indisputably glorious cheeses but they do not all belong in a casserole dish an impromptu focus group of children living in my apartment building showed a strong preference for the cheddar family ultimately , i found , the dirty little secret of an honest macaroni and cheese is often american cheese american cheese is simply cheddar or colby that is ground and emulsified with water , said bonnie chlebecek , a test kitchen manager at land o'lakes in arden hills , minn the process denatures the proteins in the cheese , she said , which in plain english means that it wo n't clump up or get grainy when you melt it with natural cheese , it s much harder to get a smooth melt the cheese industry and the food and drug administration call a cheese natural if it has been produced from milk , as cheddar and mozzarella \( and virtually all other nonindustrial cheeses \) are plain american cheese , labeled pasteurized process cheese , contains the most natural cheese and is the best for cooking american cheese derivatives are made from cheese and additives like sodium phosphates \( acids that promote melting \) , nonfat dry milk and carrageenan in descending order of their relationship to natural cheese , they are cheese food , cheese spread \( such as velveeta \) and cheese product
dr hwang woo suk , the south korean researcher who claimed to have cloned human cells , fabricated evidence for all of that research , according to a report released today by a seoul national university panel investigating his work the finding strips any possibility of legitimate achievement in human cell cloning from a researcher who had been propelled to international celebrity and whose promise to make paralyzed people walk had been engraved on a korean postage stamp in his string of splashy papers , his one legitimate claim was to have cloned the dog he named snuppy , the panel said dr hwang s team cannot avoid taking grave responsibility for fabricating its papers and concealing data , said chung myunghee , the head of the university s investigatory panel last month the panel said there was no evidence to support dr hwang s claim in june 2005 to have cloned cells from 11 patients with an efficient new technique using very few human eggs but that still left open the possibility that he had gotten the cloning technique to work to some degree , as he wrote in the report first announcing his success in an earlier article in march 2004 the panel found that the 2004 article was also fabricated dr hwang s professional demise is a severe embarrassment for the korean government , which invested some 65 million in his laboratory and in making him a national hero but the blow to korea s scientific reputation abroad may be cushioned by the fact that other korean institutions , notably the television program pd notebook and a group of skeptical young korean scientists , took the lead in discovering the problems with dr hwang s work and in eventually forcing the investigation by the university dr hwang still has public support last night 150 people festooned trees and shrubs at the gate of seoul national university with strips of yellow , blue and green cloth banners that were hung between the trees showed the korean flag and slogans such as the pride of korea or biotechnology is our future korean prosecutors , however , have barred dr hwang and nine other south korean scientists from leaving the country they have said they will launch an investigation as soon as the university panel announced its findings the seoul panel said dr hwang had accomplished only the first steps toward creating embryonic stem cell lines from people , and had failed to create any successful line , despite the many resources at his disposal those included skilled technicians and a bountiful supply of human eggs as many as 2 , 061 eggs from 129 women , an extraordinary number , given the pain and difficulty of extracting eggs from their donors the cell colony he presented in his 2004 report as being derived from a person was in fact a human egg , induced to develop by parthenogenesis , also known informally as virgin birth because no sperm is used with humans , however , such eggs do not develop very far the panel criticized dr hwang for fabricating data and said his scandalous case would be a learning experience for korean science the young scientists who courageously pointed out the fallacy and precipitated the initiation of this investigation are our hope for the future , the panel said as for the field of embryonic stem cells , researchers in the united states say it should not be much affected in the long run , at least on a scientific level , since its theoretical promise is unchanged by one man s misdeeds in practical terms , however , the panel s new finding is a sharp setback for therapeutic cloning , the much discussed goal of converting a patient s own cells into new tissue to treat a wide variety of degenerative diseases from diabetes to heart disease the technique for cloning human cells , which seemed to have been achieved since march 2004 , now turns out not to exist at all , forcing cloning researchers back to square one the seoul panel s finding also raises the question of how an important but fabricated result could survive unchallenged , in a presumably rigorous and competitive scientific field , for almost two years dr hwang s escapade may have prevented other researchers entering the field of human cloning because he seemed to have it all sewn up i have to admit that i decided not to push the efforts here at stanford because it would have been almost unethical to work with human eggs if he had made the process so efficient , said dr irving weissman , a leading stem cell researcher dr robert lanza , vice president of advanced cell technology , a massachusetts company that had

veggie burgers are nothing new i remember them from the kosher dairy restaurants of the lower east side when i was growing up but they have gone mainstream and in the process , for the most part , they 've become worse the most common ones are frozen disks of what seems like library paste the fact that it s often organic library paste soy flour , water , seasonings and texturizers is presumably what makes it acceptable to sell it for 6 or 8 a pound \( given that many people are accustomed to meat burgers that do not taste not much better , this is hardly a shock \) as with traditional burgers , those made without meat do n't need a lot of ingredients or an elaborate process to be juicy and delicious \( they can also be prepared on a tiny budget \) whether based on legumes , vegetables , nuts or tofu , they can be flavored in a variety of ways and take a number of forms the same mixtures used for burgers can generate cutlets , meat loaf or meat balls my favorite veggie burger starts with cooked or canned beans but no matter what you use , a food processor is essential , because you almost always want to pulse the primary ingredient into small bits \( occasionally you 'll want to puree part of the mix , and the food processor does this well too \) you can use a combination of hand chopping , mashing and a blender , but it s going to be more time consuming vegetables , legumes and nuts do n't have the connective tissue that helps hold meat patties together , so they require a little binder to create a cohesive mass that can be shaped and handled the idea is to use ingredients that bridge the gap between liquids and solids by capturing the moisture and transforming it into a binder the starch found in potatoes , beans , grains or breadcrumbs often does the trick so does a little egg or even butter in other cases \( like the tofu burger \) , simply pureeing some of the tofu , which has both protein and fat , holds everything together nicely grilling veggie burgers is possible , but they 're fragile , so i usually panfry them there are three secrets to a veggie burger with a crisp outer crust and a tender interior be sure there is enough hot fat in the pan before cooking let the patties cook on one side until it is nicely browned \( if you 're not using a nonstick pan , you 'll know they 're ready to turn because they will release

readers respond to david brooks s feb 19 column ,  robert guido , austin , tex another good question that should be asked , but never is why should cultures be hammered to fit economic systems that do not fit them \? furthermore , i wouldn t assume the dispute between economic systems has been settled now it isn t like arm wrestling the only thing that s been established is that an extremely utopian proposition failed , as extreme propositions tend to john sahr , seattle i have to say that i disagree with just about the entire premise of your article you suggest that , instead of becoming more secular , bettereducated people are becoming more religious i think you re just plain wrong the hyperreligious are more visible , but they re not better educated modern liberal education really does tend to generate more secular people america is widely perceived to be less educated than western and northern europe , for example , and america is definitely more religious ireland used to be a net exporter of catholic priests , and now it is an importer of priests similarly , the literal cultural explosion in the middle east is occurring primarily among profoundly uneducated , povertystricken people birthrates are low among the affluent , regardless of cultural or religious background , and high among the poor especially high among certain cultural segments in other words , the whole introductory premise of your column is , i think wrong we may find that the winning paradigm will crater as well , when pushed to the stops globalizing a onesizefitsall system of laissezfair capitalism seems a rather foolish provocation of the fates , as well as of cultures unwise , like planting a single crop in every field , regardless of the soil and shade then hoping you ll never see a blight dennis d cox , houston , tex your column today is truly a work of art , renouncing rational economics as the queen of social sciences in favor of abnormal psychology it seems the latter has much more sway in our times riots about cartoons and reporters obsessing on hunting accidents being the most obvious evidence economics was always based on fallacies , one of which that humans are completely rational humans are only partially rational it is organized irrationality that we must try to counteract i am convinced that the cartoon riots are organized by extremists who concoct tales of desecration of religious symbols to enrage people experiencing so much economic frustration in their own lives the world would be a much better place if it achieved a state wherein the axioms of economics maximization of expected utility were valid the germans and french have put aside their historical differences so as to form a common union whose currency has overwhelmed the dollar if this lamb and lion can lie down together some scant 60 years after a horrible war , why cannot the other combatants find some way to accommodate and especially trade with one another \? we can only hope that the axioms of economics will come true in our lifetimes harold norris , new york thank you for discussing the intersections of culture and economics i do question your using education as an example and the statistics that you quote of the us spending more money on education than any other country in the world that has not been my experience , especially if it s measured per capita my personal experience is that education , although it may not erase fanaticism or ideology , does temper violence as an answer to disagreement i also find that more young americans are increasingly less educated that could be why watching television news has become more popular than reading newspapers such as the new york times my concern is more with the loss of curiosity that i find more and more prevalent in this country , both by the media in investigating our leaders and institutions and in covering other cultures and our young people in their desire to travel the world , learn a different language and experience other cultures either economics or politics is winning the day while culture and humanity languishes andrew brod , greensboro , nc so , supposedly economics used to be the queen of the social sciences but isn t now because its important predictions haven t come true now , economics may or may not be the queen but speaking as someone who earned a phd in economics at a topten program , i don t recall ever hearing these alleged predictions i don t recall anyone claiming that increasing wealth would spell the end of religion , tribalism , etc , or that economics trumps culture in general increasing wealth does tend to have effects , of course to pick just one example , because environmental quality appears to be a normal good in the lingo of economics , increasing wealth often leads to an improved environment , not a degraded one but that s a prediction that keeps well within the realm of purely economic decisions , in which scarce resources are weighed against potentially unlimited wants your invocation of culture doesn t quite fit in fact , my sense is that economics has always been keenly aware of the central role of culture why is it okay for a market for brides to exist in parts of africa but not here \? obviously it s culture why isn t it okay to set up a market for adopted babies when the extreme imbalance between available babies and hopeful parents practically begs for an economic solution \? because we find the notion repugnant now , it may well be that certain lay advocates of freemarket economics have made the claims you cite and while alan greenspan is an economist and was a skilled central banker , no one has ever accused him of being an expert on the broader cultural significance of economics it s kind of cheap to use such nonexpert predictions as a standin for economics richard helm , santiago , chile as a former economics student , i very much enjoyed your essay on the gradual demolition of some of the previously sacrosanct assumptions of free market economics like many , i always intuitively doubted the universal validity of many core assumptions of economists , which held that virtually all human behavior could be explained solely by economic incentives i , for one , find cause for optimism that a more multidisciplinary approach toward development has emerged in recent years as it becomes clear that reality is bit more complex than economists had told us raj grewal , new york your opinion piece makes some interesting points , but i can t help but think that it is a little extreme to say none of the suppositions mentioned in the first paragraph turned out to be true i m genuinely curious as to how much of the newfound strength of religion is windowdressing church membership in europe has declined , although in america it remains strong but more importantly , the extent to which religious institutions have maintained , much less increased , their hold on our moral intuitions , at least in the west , is questionable if you poll american catholics and catholics in europe , you would discover a diversity of opinion on issues such as abortion , homosexuality and premarital sex , to name a few , which no doubt makes the vatican quite uneasy the hold that religious institutions have on fundamentalist societies like saudi arabia and iran is much more significant economists would also love to point out that the existence of more fundamentalistminded religious institutions might in part be due to a classic feedback effect as more secular and independently minded people leave the church or mosque , more fundamentalistminded individuals fill the void now , as more children of the 60 s come back to the church , in america at least , they might find their choices limited to more fundamentalistminded institutions we live in a rapidly changing global culture that frightens may people around the world some people are driven towards old ways of thinking to calm their fears but considering the fact that many are driven to these decisions in countries with an overall power vacuum such as iraq , the need for physical and economic security probably weighs heavily in their decisionmaking , thus making their decisions , on some level , quite rational
the life aquatic is no picnic not if you happen to be one of the 70 , 000 winter flounder fry darting around the climatecontrolled tanks at robert valenti s vastly eclectic bayfront fish farm , a k a multi aquaculture systems oops for accuracy s sake , it s time to downsize that count to 35 , 000 flounder fry , give or take a few the recently departed others were apparently victims of a pump malfunction that effectively served as an agent of accidental euthanasia and now it s looking as if dr valenti will , for legal reasons , have to intentionally pull the plug on the rest a bummer , really , for a guy who makes his living from but has actually loved marine beings ever since grandma gave him a fishcentric reference book and a couple of fancy goldfish at age 12 dr valenti , a licensed biologist and certified character , spawned and raised the fingerling winter flounder at the behest of the trustees of the town of east hampton , who paid him 19 , 000 for his time , trouble and expertise but due to circumstances beyond his control , none of these flounder will swim in the sound or encounter the business end of a hook the surviving flounder are on death row , too , all because the new york state department of environmental conservation has forbidden dr valenti , who prefers to be called bob , to release them into town waters as originally planned replenishing the stock , which has been depleted by predators , was the goal but the department , citing a 2005 dictate by the atlantic states marine fisheries commission , refuses to allow the flounder to join their wild brethren the federal take on the fish farm s flounder operation is that it violates policy the state s take is that flounder conservation is best achieved by limiting the catch the town s take , as articulated by larry penny , its natural resource director , is that the new york state dec is completely behind the curve meanwhile , sag harbor s annual winter flounder festival has twice been canceled , mr penny said no flounder trying to restock a species through regulations and more regulations is not enough , he said this thing is starting to feel like a kafka play so it s crunch time a stay of execution from gov george e pataki did not materialize , but bill mott , clerk of the town trustees , has n't given up in a state where the legislature approved not one but two official state fish , the notion of a pardon does n't seem so outlandish unfortunately for the flounder , though , it is brook trout \( fresh water \) and striped bass \( salt water \) that got the symbolic nod the governor may be a fish fan , but he was in spain last week and unavailable to intercede on behalf of the flounder fry and a deal with rhode island to adopt the flounder and plop them in the sound has n't panned out , either mr mott s joke about peddling the flounder on ebay once the department of environmental conservation made it clear that it would not , under any circumstances , license the town to release them \? gallows humor blame it on politics and power , complains bob valenti , a cranky ichthyologist who works out of a shed behind a door with a sign that warns keep out do not open this door open it and there sits bob , wearing defiantly unhamptonslike white crew socks with his sandals , attended by louie , a slumbering 11yearold rhodesian ridgeback the size of a small grizzly bear a half dozen of louie s younger colleagues \( bob s wife is the dog breeder in the family \) are kenneled outside bob and louie like airconditioning a statue of a sumo wrestler sits on the desk , a gift from a korean customer koreans buy and eat their fish alive , says bob , and account for a heaping helping of the 40 , 000 pounds of live fluke he sold last year a copy of the secret life of lobsters is propped against the wrestler bob has n't read it does n't need to selling lobsters is the quickest way to lose your shirt , he says it s a profitmargin thing the same goes , sort of , for this crop of winter flounder , which was supposed to be out of his hair by summer instead of taking up tank space , running up 4 , 000 a month in utility bills and making him drive from his home in springs for the midnight bed check \( cool sea water is constantly pumped into the holding tanks \) and feeding babysitting for them has ceased to make sense i take from the sea , i sell what i get and make money from the sea , and i honestly thought this was a way of giving back to the sea , dr valenti says sobering then , to get a letter from the department of environmental conservation threatening to yank his license to breed fish if he releases the flounder to the town trustees he and his business would be dead in the water so he is resigned to the death of the flounder this 2006 project was intended as a bigger , better version of last year s 8 , 000 hatch , which produced 30 , 000 flounder , with the fittest of the fry being released into town waters last year the dec did not intervene note to sag harbor it s probably prudent to cancel the next winter flounder festival photo \( photo by multi aquaculture systems \)
when gerda kamberova started househunting on long island , she considered price , location and size , like everyone else but topping her wish list , she said , was an additional item a dogfriendly town we felt it was really important that our dog have a place to exercise and play , said dr kamberova , the chairwoman of the computer science department at hofstra university , who shares her home in merrick with her husband , george kamberov , and bella , an 85pound german shepherd dogs were n't allowed anywhere near the grass in atlantic beach , where we lived , she said we were just a block from the beach , but bella was n't allowed there , either so i never saw the ocean i 'd just see people sneaking like criminals to take their dogs onto the sand why should i have to do that \? in merrick the couple found a small neighborhood park , where they could walk bella on a leash , and lush patches of grass along the sidewalk people said hello to them as they strolled with their dog after that , it was easy to find a house there still , dr kamberova said , she would be much happier if she could take bella to one of the large nassau county parks nearby to romp offleash eisenhower park in east meadow is so huge , she said why is n't there room there for a few dogs \? the answer , said eileen barish , the author of a series of books about traveling with pets , is that long island is unfriendly to dogs with all the beaches and open spaces , you 'd think there 'd be a lot of places to give your dog exercise , but it s just not so , ms barish said instead , you have to steal onto beaches and hope that if you 're caught you get a firsttime warning and not a summons families looking for a place to stretch the pooch s legs sometimes congregate in empty lots or quiet stretches of industrialpark lawn where no one is likely to complain two examples in the port washington area are the old thomson industries property on channel drive and the strip of land next to the town of north hempstead animal shelter , according to jennifer wilsonpines , deputy mayor of manorhaven and a dog owner herself these places serve as a kind of informal dog run , since there s nowhere nearby where dogs are allowed , ms wilsonpines said people need places to take their dogs offleash , and they go where they know no one will bother them , making their own dog parks in an area where there are none what else are you going to do , when you ca n't take them to a neighborhood park \? roger tucker , who has offered obedience training to long island dogs and their owners for 35 years , said the key to making communities more petfriendly is ensuring that the dogs behave properly dogs can easily and quickly be taught to heed commands and disturb no one , ever , he said every kid should grow up with a dog they can really improve family life and make the neighborhood nicer not everyone agrees and those who believe that their neighbors' dogs do little to enhance their own lives often complain peter heller , a mortgage banker who has lived in a gated community in jericho for the last 18 years , said that inconsiderate dog owners enrage him , and local board meetings heat up to boiling whenever the topic is mentioned there seems to be an unwritten law that dog owners can only walk their dogs on someone else s property , never on their own , mr heller said why ruin their own grass when they can ruin yours \? to contain the problem , he said , his condominium board offered to create a dog run at one end of the complex , but resident dog owners said in a survey that it would be too long a walk from their units to me , the question is , do you have a dog , or does your dog have you \? mr heller said where to allow dogs to run , play and do their business is also a concern for municipal leaders for example , the great neck park district bans dogs from all its parks , but robert lincoln , one of the district s three commissioners , said that dog owners recently asked the district to turn one lesserused outdoor recreational area , ravine park on east shore road , into a dog park but homeowners whose lots border the park complained strenuously about potential noise and odor , and the proposal was dropped without a formal vote i love dogs , and i really think we need a place for them in our town , said mr lincoln , who has a dalmatian creating a spot for tailwagging fun is complicated kings point park , for example , which has a great wooded area , also has a clause in its lease that prohibits building a dog park there , mr lincoln said he said that special water fountains and playground equipment are available for dogs and that urban dog parks like the one at chelsea piers in manhattan offer exercise and camaraderie for both dogs and their owners people here think a dog park a great idea as long as it s not near them , he said naomi garfinkel , who operates a pet service that walks up to 80 long island dogs a day , said new york city is much more dogfriendly than the island is it s ok to take them into central park or to eat in outdoor restaurants , she said even the museum of natural history has a dog run why does n't long island do more for dogs and their families \? most dog owners , like dr kamberova , eventually find one of the small number of regional dog runs , like those at nickerson beach in nassau beach park \( where she takes bella daily \) , christopher morley park in roslyn heights , cedar creek park in seaford or wantagh park others take their dogs out on the sand legally at places like east hampton beach , shelter island beach or montauk point state park in the offseason , or risk 100 fines at beaches that do n't welcome them dogs are social creatures , and they need other dogs to play with , to befriend , said mr tucker , the obedience trainer they have to exercise somewhere we 're the ones who have to adapt photo gerda kamberova and george kamberov at the nickerson beach dog run in nassau beach park with bella , their german shepherd \( photo by kirk condyles for the new york times \)

tehran , dec 11 iran held a gathering that included holocaust deniers , discredited scholars and white supremacists from around the world on monday under the guise of a conference to debate the nazi annihilation of six million jews among those representing the united states was the former ku klux klan leader david duke , whose prepared remarks , issued by the iranian foreign ministry , said the gas chambers in which millions perished actually did not exist robert faurisson , an academic from france , said in his speech that the holocaust was a myth created to justify the occupation of palestine , meaning the creation of israel that is what iran s president , mahmoud ahmadinejad , has frequently claimed , and it was mr ahmadinejad s statements that inspired the foreign ministry to hold the conference the ministry said 67 people from 30 countries were participating in the two days of meetings in a welcoming speech , rasoul mousavi , head of the foreign ministry s institute for political and international studies , said the session would provide an opportunity to discuss the holocaust away from western taboos and the restriction imposed on them in europe in several european countries , denial of the holocaust is a crime an accompanying exhibition also denied the holocaust one poster with three photographs showed dead bodies and described accounts of their gassing as a myth signs pointed to smiling prisoners freed at the end of the war with the label truth new captions in persian on other pictures of corpses described them as victims of a typhus epidemic in europe , not of the nazi death machine speakers at the conference praised mr ahmadinejad s comments about the holocaust bendikt frings , 48 , a psychologist from germany , said he believed that mr ahmadinejad was an honest , direct man he said he had come to the conference to thank the president for what he had initiated we are forbidden to have such a conference in germany , he said all my childhood , we waited for something like this frederick toben , from australia , said mr ahmadinejad had opened an issue which is morally and intellectually crippling the western society people are imprisoned in germany for denying the holocaust , he added mr toben said that he was jailed for six months in 1999 for his ideas and that there was a court order in germany to arrest him if he again spoke against the holocaust mr duke s speech argued that inventions about what happened to europe s jews were part of a plot he said , depicting jews as the overwhelming victims of the holocaust gave the moral high ground to the allies as victors of the war and allowed jews to establish a state on the occupied land of palestine there were also members of antizionist ultraorthodox jewish sects in attendance one jewish participant in a long black coat and hat wore a badge saying a jew , not a zionist a 2004 book by an american author , michael collins piper , the new jerusalem zionist power in america , was on sale for 20 it was not clear how the speakers were assembled the institute s web site invited scholars and researchers to submit their papers in advance the foreign ministry provided little information about the participants , saying that it feared they would be prosecuted by their countries the organizers said they planned for both sides to be heard , but none of the speeches collected in the ministry s book or any of the exhibitions spoke of the reality of the nazi killing a cd with the stories of 12 holocaust survivors was said to be available the event has sparked outrage in the west germany summoned the iranian charg d affaires to express its anger , and the french foreign minister , philippe dousteblazy , has condemned the conference last summer , iran created a contest for cartoons about the holocaust in reaction to the controversy over danish cartoons lampooning the prophet muhammad the iranian jewish community reacted angrily to mr ahmadinejad s comments last year and said his words had spread fear among them we consider the holocaust as a fact and a disgrace for humanity , the head of the community , haround yashayai , said monday
when jackie ebron , lynette loadholt and denise eugene go to work in the morning , their paths never cross but their paths do run parallel in many respects all three women , dedicated to social work , are employed by social service agencies that are among the seven beneficiaries of the new york times neediest cases fund in their different roles , they all spend many hours assisting the city s poorest residents recent immigrants , newly unemployed or working poor people and medically fragile , physically or mentally disabled children and adults and there is one other thing they have in common they often draw on the neediest cases to help these new yorkers through what may be the bleakest time in their lives the aid could stop an eviction , or utility from being turned off it could be used to buy food , medicine , said ms ebron , who directs the crisis intervention program for the metropolitan council on jewish poverty the council is a beneficiary agency of the ujafederation of new york , one of the seven neediest cases charities the fund , she added , allows people to sustain themselves while they are working toward a goal providing this sort of support whether through the neediest cases or from state and federal sources has become an increasingly formidable task in new york city the city s poverty rate has climbed each year since 1999 , and one in five residents now lives in poverty , according to a recent report by the community service society , another neediest cases beneficiary agency the same report found that one in three children lives in poverty at the same time , earnings have declined , particularly for the city s lowest paying jobs , the report found but while the need for charitable support remains as persistent and as urgent as ever , this year s annual neediest cases fundraising campaign has lost significant ground in trying to match last year s donations in this , the fund s 94th such campaign , donations are down 7 percent from last year s level of giving and the number of donors has dipped as well , declining by about 14 percent the campaign , which began in early november , ends on feb 3 \( with donations received through feb 6 credited to the 20056 drive \) the decline leaves us concerned , said jack rosenthal , president of the new york times company foundation the income gap between rich and poor in new york is greater than anywhere else in the country that s all the more reason for us to hope for a closing surge in contributions and in donors for ms eugene , ms loadholt , ms ebron , and other professionals at the seven charities the neediest cases supports , the decline in donations is especially troubling they know what that resource can mean to someone facing a mountain of debt , a chronic illness , or a blast of winter without a warm winter coat with the neediest fund accessible , i can eliminate fears , ms ebron said an imperative to act ms ebron , 55 , has been at the metropolitan council on jewish poverty for 16 years when she started , she went to poor neighborhoods in coney island , brooklyn , to help newly transplanted immigrants , mostly elderly russians struggling to adjust to life in the united states witnessing the need for a centralized crisis center , she made the suggestion to start a center and is now its director within a given week , she assists people of all ages and faiths in the last month alone , she helped 197 clients referred to her by social workers from 25 community councils scattered throughout new york city those workers are the eyes and ears of neighborhoods and are intimately aware of the hardships that people are enduring when a client is in crisis , she said , there is an imperative to act in this respect , the unrestricted assistance available through the neediest cases gives her the flexibility to respond , and respond quickly by the time i see someone , they 're in over their heads , she said they 're not one month behind in rent , but four months and facing eviction , or at the point where the heat is going to be turned off this was the situation in one recent case , involving a single mother with triplets who arrived at her office in dire need after being abandoned by the children s father he left her with nothing , said ms ebron , who received money from the neediest cases to provide essentials food , clothing and baby strollers such assistance can clear away immediate worries so both client and agency can begin to focus on the longer term issues in this case , the young mother s whole outlook changed as a result of her visit to the agency by the time the interview was over , there was a plan in place for housing , public assistance , food stamps and , further down the road , job training ms ebron , and her counterparts at other agencies , also find that the neediest cases can give clients with unremitting illnesses some reprieve a diagnosis of ovarian cancer , for example , can put an even greater strain on an already tight budget , not to mention breaking a woman s spirit

click read more to read the playbyplay of the jets game against the indianapolis colts , as it happened at giants stadium in east rutherford , nj postgame colts 31 , jets 28 there were so many lead changes in a highly entertaining second half that it s hard to sum up maybe you can secondguess mangini for going for it on fourthand2 instead of kicking a field goal to try to go up , 1714 , but ultimately the jets defense couldn t stop manning when it mattered the defensive line didn t put much pressure on manning and he was able to pick the secondary apart the most memorable part of the finale was the wild swing in the kickoff returns , with justin miller going 103 yards to put the jets up , 2824 , then leon washingon misplaying a kickoff to bury the jets deep in their territory on their final possession and the final play , in which the jets tried to lateral their way to the end zone update youtube video of the jets last gasp is here  in the postgame show , mangini is defending his decision to go for it on fourth down , saying that with the colts explosive offense , the jets needed maximum points here are some of the final stats manning and pennington were typically efficient manning was 21 for 30 for 217 yards , and pennington was 17 for 23 for 207 yards each had one touchdown pass , and pennington was intercepted once , in the end zone on the fourthdown play coles had 6 catches for 81 yards , another fine game , and cotchery had 3 catches for 65 yards and a touchdown tim dwight had 3 catches for 31 yards the jets running backs split their carries , with houston gaining 49 yards , barlow 35 and washington 33 the colts had great success running the ball , with addai gaining 84 yards and rhodes 75 with not much separating the teams , the turnovers proved to be crucial , as they always seem to be the jets had two turnovers and the colts none given how the game started , with the pennington fumble and the quick indy score , the jets acquitted themselves well , giving the colts \( 40 \) all they could handle the jets fall to 22 , with another tough game next sunday , at jacksonville at 4 05 , but they have to feel they can stay with anybody after this game here are the links from the times writers who covered the game bill pennington has the game story  dave anderson touched on manning s finishing touch  damon hack wrote about reggie wayne s chance to forget his grief   4th quarter , colts 31 , jets 28 only 50 seconds to go the jets have one timeout leon washington , for some reason , is back on the kickoff return instead of miller a squib kick by gramatica gets by washington , and he runs back and picks it up and gets tackled at the 2 disaster the ball skipped by everyone , and the jets will have to go 98 yards to win a catch by dwight takes the jets to the 11 another catch , this one by cotchery , but there s only 19 seconds to go the jets call a timeout , their final one they need a long reception and a spike and a field goal coles catches a sideline pass for 7 yards and steps out , but it s not nearly enough the jets need a deeper pass the ball is tipped away from cotchery eight seconds to go , no timeouts now it s desperation time , no time to set up a field goal a completion , and the jets start a crazy series of laterals about six of them what a final sequence ! it takes about 35 seconds as the jets throw laterals all over the field , trying for their own version of the standordcal game even pennington gets into the act with a lateral , but now the ball is fumbled and the colts recover the game is over the colts win 3128 cbs cuts away quickly after the game , but on the radio , they re saying that coles is in pain on the field , and the jets medical staff surrounds him he was hurt on the final play we ll have to wait to how badly 4th quarter , jets 28 , colts 24 1 19 to go first down , colts , on the jets 16 incomplete to clark , way over his head in the end zone wayne with a catch at the halfyard line ! ! manning rushes up , wastes no time , and he goes over for a touchdown manning catches the jets napping for a quarterback sneak gramatica kicks the extra point , and we have another lead change the colts lead 3128 4th quarter , jets 28 , colts 24 manning passes to addai to the colts 43 at the twominute warning now it comes down to whether the jets defense can keep manning and the colts out of the end zone really , a pretty entertaining game , with a bunch of lead switches in the second half maybe the jets should root for manning to score early so they ll have time to score themselves fletcher catches a sideline pass to the jets 48 clock stops at 1 50 fletcher is wide open on the left for a 10yard gain again , he steps out of bounds , so clock is stopped from the jets 39 , manning finds clark over the middle for 4 yards , to the jets 35 manning works quickly and the ball bounces away from wayne vilma almost pounces for an interception manning starts running a draw , then stops , sees harrison open , and fires to him on the right sideline for a big gain , to the jets 16 the jets , disorganized , call timeout to try to regroup 1 19 to go the jets have one timeout left 4th quarter , colts 24 , jets 21 there s 2 34 to go , and the colts have taken a 3point lead whoohooo ! ! ! justin miller goes 103 yards on the return for a touchdown he broke two tackles at the 40 yardline and just kept going the jets have retaken the lead extra point is good , and it s jets 28 , colts 24  the return was spectacular a mustsee on the highlights tonight gramatica grabbed onto his jersey and dragged him but couldn t hold on 4th quarter , jets 21 , colts 17 first and 20 from the jets 30 manning goes for the end zone incomplete to wayne nice play by justin miller another pass to wayne in the end zone incomplete but miller is called for pass interference the ball will be placed on the 8 both players were pushing maybe it should have been a nocall a beer bottle is thrown from the stands after the replay is shown at the stadium kerry rhodes goes over and tries to calm the crowd addai drives down to the 3yard line manning is quick to the line , and addai gains a yard it s thirdandgoal from the 2 play action , manning backpedals , and manning finds fletcher , the tight end , open for a touchdown extra point is good , and the colts lead , 2421  4th quarter , jets 21 , colts 17 the jets have just taken the lead they ve played well in the fourth quarter of all of their games mangini will surely say it s because of the tough training camp he ran wilkins returns it to the 32 7 50 left a short pass to addai for 6 yards , then addai runs for 6 yards addai for two yards \( note addai was there for the jets taking in the first round of the draft , but the jets picked center nick mangold from ohio state at no 29 the colts picked addai , from lsu at no 30 \) addai is stopped for 2 yards third and 6 , and the crowd is roaring ! but manning has time and he finds tight end dallas clark to the jets 32 first down addai gains 4 yards as the clock ticks under 5 00 harrison makes a catch on a quick slant for a first down the clock is at 4 10 manning is flushed out of the pocket , but he still finds harrison at the jets 20 on a desperation pass on an out route manning is in command ! a holding penalty on the colts after addai gained five more vilma was held , and the colts are going backward 4th quarter , colts 17 , jets 14 the jets have the ball at the colts 18 at firstand10 handoff to washington , who goes up the middle for 5 yards washington has been a revelation in the second half quick play , and washington picks up three more it s thirdand2 at the colts 10 pennington is barking out the signals , 8 15 left , changing the play at the line incomplete , but the colts are called for illegal contact on coles , and it s a first down barlow is hit at the 5 , but he keeps his legs churning and bulls over for a touchdown touchdown a sweet run by barlow after he was hit early the extra point is good , and the jets lead , 2117  4th quarter , colts 17 , jets 14 the jets start with good field position , around their 38 , after a short kick by gramatica is brought back by the upback matt chatham 6yard gain by washington nice catch by coles on an out route for a first down first down the jets are at the indy 48 11 50 to go washington finds a seam and goes for 6 yards the jets have really mixed it up in their running game , alternating houston , barlow and washington \( houston is now hurt \) incomplete to mccareins , who probably should have caught it but coles makes a catch on the next play and breaks a tackle to the colts 31 first down washington picks up 6 and 2 yards consecutively bj askew picks up 5 yards for the first down with nine minutes left the jets do a hurryup on the next play , and the colts are forced to call timeout they weren t prepared , and now the colts are out of timeouts 4th quarter , colts 17 , jets 14 dungy came out ahead in that particular coaching matchup with mangini , who elected to go for it on fourth down from the 2 and came up empty instead of kicking the field goal dungy took the sure points and the colts have the lead start of the fourth quarter , jets 14 , colts 14 rhodes finds plenty of room and runs to the jets 14 rhodes again for a couple , and it s second and goal at the jets 1 rhodes loses a yard , robertson with the tackle for the jets he had great penetration ball goes to rhodes again on third down , and flags fly as he s stopped short penalty against the colts the jets decline it s fourth and goal from the 1 , and dungy , unlike mangini , decides to go for the field goal and the lead gramatica kicks it through for a 1714 lead 3nd quarter , jets 14 , colts 14 mangini is 1 for 2 on controversial decisions the onside kick worked to perfection , but the decision to go for it on fourth down instead of kicking a field goal will be secondguessed it s easy for me to say , but since the jets were on the 2 \( the 2 1 2 , actually \) , it would have been wiser to take the 3 points the colts , on a thirdand2 , get a first down on an addai run harrison gets a first down with a catch out to the colt 49 big running room for addai , and he gets to the jets 40 for a first down addai again , and this time he gets 5 , to the jets 35 addai again , for 4 , and he s a yard short of a first down 30 seconds to go in the quarter from the jets 32 , manning gives to addai , but flags fly it s a false start third down and 6 from the jets 37 wayne is wide open for a catch , and he gets to the jets 23 end of the quarter jets , 14 , colts 14  3nd quarter , jets 14 , colts 14 houston is carted off the field he couldn t put any weight on his leg the jets are going for it on fourth down ! another surprise by mangini ! pennington , on a playfake , is pressured right away and throws an interception in the end zone pennington was under duress , and now the colts will be able to start at their 20 instead of their 2 the jets get nothing and will have to like it after a timeconsuming and wellexecuted drive 3nd quarter , jets 14 , colts 14 9 12 left in the quarter barlow runs to the colts 30 it s third and 7 coles comes back for the ball and makes a nice juggling catch for a first down from the 19 , barlow gets a yard up the middle a short dumpoff pass by pennington , then pennington draws the colts offside the jets are at the 7 houston gets 5 yards to the 2 after a 1yard pickup by houston , it s third and goal from the 1 pennington calls a timeout the jets are poised to take the lead , and this will be the 15th play of the drive , a drive that has chewed up eight minutes of clock here we go on a pivotal third down freeney gets into the backfield and stops houston at the 2 ! houston is injured , prone on the field now what will mangini do \? he probably needs to kick the field goal the ball is at the 2 there is 4 55 to go in third quarter , and jets trainers are on the field examining houston s knee timeout 3nd quarter , jets 14 , colts 14 pennington , starting at the jets 21 , completes a pass to coles on the sideline after a playaction fake and a rollout it s a first down houston runs for 2 houston runs again for 4 more to the jets 37 , and it ll be thirdandfour pennington feels pressure , and he runs and slides for a first down , just beyond the marker tony dungy throws the red challenge flag he thinks pennington slid before the firstdown marker seems to be a bad call by dungy it looked like pennington made it after a review , the play stands the jets are at their 41 with 11 50 left in the quarter false start on the jets , by kendall , who is back in the lineup today houston , running behind ferguson , turns the corner for a 4yard gain pennington scrambles and hits coles , and coles beats his man after the catch for a first down at the colts 46 cedric houston pierces through middle the jets ground game is alive ! and he gets to the 34 pennington throws a jump ball for coles near the end zone , and it s incomplete 9 12 to go the colts burn a timeout to get an injured player , kelvin hayden , off the field indy has one timeout left , and dungy is steaming that there wasn t an injury timeout called by the officials 3nd quarter , jets 14 , colts 14 colts start the second half with a short run by rhodes to the 33 quick pass to harrison , and he gets to the colts 47 a 14yard pickup harrison passes andre reed for fourth on the career list of receptions after a short run and an incompletion , it s third and 7 manning under pressure , and he s sacked by ellis a big loss and the second sack by ellis 13 00 to go in the quarter the colts punt the jets , an 8point or 9point underdog , depending on who you believe , are playing indy on an equal footing halftime , jets 14 , colts 14 welcome to the halftime report the jets seemed completely lost in the first quarter pennington coughed up a quick fumble , and the colts took advantage with a quick touchdown the jets running game gained 9 total yards in the quarter , and the colts were ripping off consistent chucks of yardage behind rhodes and addai but the jets turned it around thanks to 1 \) jerricho cotchery , who continued the jets success in yac \( yards after catch \) with a nice run on a 33yard touchdown reception 2 \) eric mangini and mike nugent , who combined on a successful onside kick mangini had the guts to call it , and nugent executed it perfectly now have the jets succeeded in merely making the colts angry \? we ll see in the second half end of the half , jets 14 , colts 14 justin miller gets a great return off to the 49 , but pennington is sacked \( robert mathis s second sack \) and the clock runs out on the half , with the score tied at 1414 2nd quarter , jets 14 , colts 14 addai is the lone back , and he picks up about four yards to the jets 16 manning passes to wayne , and there may be a facemask against the jets the officials confer for quite a while after lengthy deliberations , the officials say there s no facemask incidental contact it s third and 4 at the jets 13 addai catches a pass in the left flat and gets a first down , advancing to the jets 9 it s firstandgoal with 37 seconds to go harrison with a catch at the 2yard line manning is hurrying up , and addai scores from the 2 touchdown the jets were not completely set , and manning tood advantage with a quick handoff addai went up the middle for the score the extra point is good it s 1414  2nd quarter , jets 14 , colts 7 what the heck is going on here \? the jets were abysmal in the first quarter , and now they re in complete command peyton manning hasn t touched the ball in about 10 minutes now wilkins drops the ball on the kickoff and picks it up indy starts at its 15 a long bomb to reggie wayne wayne skies high to catch it ! a great catch and the colts are at the jets 44 rhodes runs left and gains 9 to the jets 35 rhodes picks up a yard for the first down the colts are on the move playaction , and manning just misses harrison in the end zone it goes off harrison s fingertips rhodes runs for 2 thirdand8 manning finds harrison for a first down at the jets 20 it s the twominute warning it s as if the jets have made the colts angry i think the colts may be shocked that the jets are still in the game the jets were so pathetic in the first quarter that the colts might have let down 2nd quarter , jets 14 , colts 7 houston slips and falls at the 11 the crowd groans it s second and goal , and houston rumbles for 8 yards to the 3 it s third and goal houston is providing some power running pass incomplete to cotchery , but a flag comes out they re going to call pass interference cotchery was hit before he could catch it barlow strolls into the end zone from the 1 touchdown , jets it completes an 11play drive after the onside kick nugent is good with the extra point , and it s 147 jets 2nd quarter , colts 7 , jets 7 an onside kick a surprise and the jets recover mangini surprises the colts with an onside kick , and nugent executes it well kerry rhodes that man again recovers for the jets the jets are at their own 43 , good field position to start another catch by cotchery , and a gain of 18 yards , and the crowd is roaring it s a hurryup offense , nohuddle barlow has room , to the 34 9 25 to go in the half barlow again for a few yards thirdand2 barlow is close to a first down , but he s short the jets are going for it on fourth down the game s tenor has completely changed cotchery s 33yard touchdown catch and the successful onside kick have kickstarted the jets and the crowd it s fourthand1 and the jets call timeout with 7 55 to go brad smith steps under center again an option it works smith pitches out to washington , and washington makes a man miss and barely gets the first down a risky move , but it works a pass to coles in the end zone is knocked away a give to barlow and he gains 6 all of a sudden , the jets are controlling the clock and the game 6 40 to go a dumpoff over the middle to tim dwight , and a late flag unnecessary roughness against the colts , and the ball moves to the colts 7 2nd quarter , colts 7 , jets 7 jets start at their 35 13 22 to go in the half a short catch by ryan , the tight end cedric houston is the lone setback now , and he carries for a few yards it s thirdand1 playaction , catch by coles , but a flag at the line will the play stand \? illegal motion is the call \( chris baker \) , and third down will be repeated a momentum killer it s now 3rdand6 pennington scrambles and completes a pass to tim dwight first down beyond midfield houston gains 13 yards to the 33 that s the jets longest running play of the season catch by cotchery beautiful stiffarm after a catch in the middle of the field he goes left and stiffarms a colts defender near the goal line touchdown for the jets if the play stands flag at the line , but offsides on the defense , so the play stands nugent s extra point is good , so it s 77 wait , a penalty on the extra point , so they ll have to try again it s good again , and it s officially 77  2nd quarter , colts 7 , jets 0 colts start at their 35 after a booming ben graham punt the colts have had no success through the air , but they haven t needed it addai gets the call and he gets 3 , then , and this is getting repetitious , addai again , for a couple more incomplete pass by manning on thirdand3 so we have two trends the colts are running the ball well , but manning and the passing game have been ineffective go figure the colts punt 1st quarter , colts 7 , jets 0 jets start at their 5 barlow again , going nowhere the jets haven t had a first down ! and they re going backward with minus19 passing yards i think they ve rushed for 8 yards ! a short catch by baker and a gain of 5 yards brad smith is the qb , and pennington lines up wide , and smith runs for a first down the jets first good offensive play , with a little trickery ! a poor pass by pennington , and coles can t get it third down and 12 four receivers for the jets the fans hate this call a draw to washington , and he only gets a few so the jets punt end of the first quarter  1st quarter , colts 7 , jets 0 colts start from their 35 commercial a chunky soup ad with donovan mcnabb and his mother , and i m starting to feel hungry \( must sit here and type ! \) here the colts go again , giving the ball to joseph addai , and he gets 9 yards the colts line is blowing the jets off the ball addai again , for a first down colts are at midfield addai again , and the runningbackbycommittee is in full roar the jets started by consistently giving the ball to rhodes , and now they re giving it to addai on every play on thirdandfour from the jet 44 , the colts have a false start surely manning will pass manning calls timeout with 3 48 to go in the quarter manning escapes good pressure from the jets \( erik coleman and bobby hamilton \) , but the jets force a punt it s a good one , to the jets 5 , with 3 12 to go 1st quarter , colts 7 , jets 0 jets start from their 30 barlow goes nowhere again the running game is offering pennington no support whatsoever washington showed some spark last week , but so far the jets are going with barlow this time , barlow loses a yard , and the crowd is not hiding its feelings fullthroated jeers it s 3rdand11 , putting pennington under the gun playaction , scrambling back , and pennington is sacked another rotten start for the jets in the first quarter they haven t scored in the quarter all year 1st quarter , colts 7 , jets 0 the colts start with 10 28 left in the quarter at their 40 rhodes runs again , and he takes the pile out to the 48 rhodes runs again for 3 yards for a first down so far , the offense amounts to giving the ball to rhodes the colts are taking a page from the bills strategy buffalo just ran willis mcgahee right at em , and the jets couldn t stop him \( jp losman was a different story \) manning goes back to pass , and shaun ellis chases manning and sacks him all the way back to the 36 gets the crowd back in the game the colts punt 1st quarter , colts 7 , jets 0 well , if you re a jets fan , that s a disheartening beginning the jets were adept at the turnover battle in the first three games mangini had made a point about it being a priority they figured to need an almost errorfree game to beat the colts , and they re already heading in the wrong direction leon washington loses a yard after slipping as the jets start over barlow gets nothing on the next run , and they re back to the line of scrimmage on 3rdand11 , pennington completes a short pass , but it s not nearly enough for a first down dwight freeney sniffed it out the crowd grumbles it s threeandout 1st quarter , colts 0 , jets 0 pennington hit from behind on the third play from scrimmage , and the ball is loose pennington fumbles after being sacked the colts recover on the jets 26 the jets had advanced to the 39 on a colts penalty and a nice run by barlow but an awful start for the jets and now dominic rhodes runs to the 11 rhodes again , and he goes to the 6 rhodes again , and he scores from the 6 touchdown he powers over with 12 28 left in the first quarter a similar start to last week s the bills scored on the second play from scrimmage it s 70 colts already moments away from kickoff the jets win the toss and will receive short kick chris baker takes it out to the 26 , and that s where the jets will start the crowd is raucous the field is a little damp , but the weather doesn t seem bad update laveranues coles \( calf \) is active for the jets he played through the calf injury last week and had 10 catches for 78 yards colts receiver brandon stokely \( ankle

footage of strongarmed quarterback john elway having two shoulder injuries , it showed some flaws in my mechanics , pennington said i always thought i used my body well to throw , but i really didn t i was really an arm thrower and that s why the ball would die on me a lot that s why my feet sometimes weren t planted in the ground when i was throwing , and the ball would flutter and so , i really had to look at that the jets are a surprising 21 and the colts are an unsurprising 30 and an 8point favorite at giants stadium last season , indy became the fourth nfl team to start 130 of course , we all know what happened in the playoffs last season and the colts history as underachievers in the postseason in general but in the regular season \? pretty hard to beat some pregame notes in a rush

here is the response of craig whitney , an assistant managing editor of the times , to the public editor s feb 26 column suggesting that times editors review the price discounts offered to the news staff this is a longer version of the feb 26 email message from mr whitney that was published in the public editor s march 5 letters column the public editor s email response to mr whitney is included below mr whitney hasn t responded to the public editor s email  hi barney i have done as you suggested and looked more closely at the employee discounts available to all who work at the nyt here are my thoughts because i happen to be looking for a new car , i checked out our employee discounts over the weekend and found some i had forgotten about and not used recently , like the verizon cellphone offer , or never knew about until you wrote about them , like the amazoncom offer almost all these perks are like those , or for museums , restaurants , theater tickets , etc the few that go beyond them in some way are avis , which you more or less absolved , and the automobile discounts from gm , ford , and daimlerchrysler as for flowers by wire , is anybody going to accuse us of violating journalistic ethics for accepting a minor discount on sending flowers by wire , any more than they would for taking one from the neighborhood pizzeria \? beyond doubting whether many \( or any \) of our fellow times employees are aware of the flowersbywire discount , i just don t see an issue with it , any more than there is with taking a discount from the pizzeria journalists are citizens like everybody else discounting is as american as apple pie discounts offered to a broad category of customers like suppliers , or residents of a neighborhood , or all employees of a given company , even a newspaper company , are not corrupt favors offered in return for friendly treatment in print , and come on nobody sees them that way , either what i found about the automotive discounts to suppliers not just to times employees , but all suppliers of these companies is encapsulated in this the daimlerchrysler affiliate rewards program allows all us employees , retirees and spouses of your company s business locations the opportunity to purchase or lease select new chrysler , jeep or dodge vehicles at the preferred price \( 1 below factory invoice plus administration fee \) eligible employees and retirees may purchase or lease a combined total of two vehicles per calendar year savings mostly include consumer incentives available at the time of sale note that last sentence beyond those , there are , of course , a bewildering variety of incentives offered to every conceivable category of americanswhat gm and chrysler offer employees of their suppliers \( we are just one company in their supplier category \) is usually no better and in some cases may be less advantageous than what they can get as members of some other category eligible for the incentives , which are available only from dealers willing to offer them the ford site gives this example for a volvo s60 the affiliate discount from the manufacturer s 30 , 270 suggested retail price is 29 , 060 without knowing about this , or identifying myself in any way , i was offered far larger discounts saturday on various versions of this model at the volvo dealer on 11th avenue and 50th street all these programs have rules barring the purchase of more than one or two vehicles , resale within six months , and anything other than personal use not all models or brands are eligible jaguar , mercedes , landrover , for instance , are all excluded from it the main thing i found is that the supplier or affiliate discounts just aren t that attractive , or even competitive with the giveaways now being used by all three companies to try to get people to buy american barring times newsroom employees \( except for those writing about the automotive industry \) from eligibility from these supplier discounts would be a purely symbolic gesture , but one without any meaningful significance whatsoever , because there is no conflict of interest , real , or apparent , as i see it best craig  craig thanks for your email it raises a number of questions in my mind it seems that i start from a different place than you do i don t believe journalists are citizens like everybody else and that discounts are as american as apple pie i believe journalists especially those at the new york times have special obligations isn t that concept a key element in many of the paper s ethical guidelines \? \( and how do you deal with the statements by klinger and 1800flowers that acknowledge the discounts are a public relations effort and designed to spread the news about their service or product \? \) if nobody thinks the discounts pose an ethical problem for journalists , why do the los angeles times , the wall street journal and the washington post refuse to allow news staffers to accept discounts on cars \? you aren t the first times person to raise the pizza discount as the sort of assumed standard for what discounts can be accepted unless the pizza discount is offered to all companies of the size of the times in midtown manhattan , i don t think it should be accepted a key point for me is the language of the paper s guideline , which you don t address it makes an exception for conventional corporate discounts that the times has offered to share with all employees \( for example , corporate car rental rates \) the discounts which i wrote about aren t conventional corporate discounts because the times as a corporation doesn t get any of these discounts through the programs how can it share something it doesn t possess \? so it isn t sharing discounts as it does with car rental and airline discounts that it negotiates for all employees to use on company and personal business \( i haven t seen the agreements on rental cars or airlines , but i bet there s a good chance that the personal use by employees helps boost volume and lowers the paper s costs \) this is what i tried to convey with my comments about discounts that the times has earned , which are ones i think news staffers can accept i also think the term conventional corporate discounts covers discounts offered to a customer to strengthen ties to them the supplier discounts aren t a conventional corporate discount similar to car rental arrangements , which the guidelines invokes to define the term none of the companies would tell me what criteria they use to decide who gets discounts , so i couldn t determine if they were bending their rules to include the times while i don t think supplier discounts fit under the paper s exception in its guideline , i would be interested in seeing any evidence you have that the auto companies offer discounts to all suppliers gm wouldn t tell me that its supplier program provided discounts to all suppliers , as you suggest as for the discounts available in the marketplace , i realize that special offers from time to time can come close to matching those available in the programs cited in my column but you have to arm yourself with information and bargain for them the programs available to times employees come with no hassle you get a coupon or code via the web or telephone and take it to the dealer by the way , if you and other times editors believe that the marketplace offers auto discounts as good as the times programs , how can you continue to allow what then has to be misleading language on the times s internal web site \? the times says on its web site , for instance , that the gm program offers incredible discounts on new gm vehicles my broader question would be if you believe the discounts on new cars and a host of other goods and services are no better than what is available in the marketplace , why not drop the employee discounts that are not conventional corporate discounts and avoid any possibility of a perception of a conflict of interest \? why keep them if they are meaningless \? i d be interested in continuing this discussion over a pizza at your convenience best , barney
there were two ways of looking at the nets' game against the philadelphia 76ers on wednesday night on one hand , it was merely another contest in a grueling 82game schedule on the other , it provided a golden opportunity for the nets to pad their lead in the atlantic division in a game between the division s top teams , vince carter scored 31 points and had 10 assists to lead the nets to a 10190 victory at the wachovia center each division game counts , regardless if it s early in the season or late in the season , said carter , who was two rebounds shy of a tripledouble you never know , you might have a tie with a team or whatever so you definitely want the tie breaker , or you definitely want the advantage when it comes to playoff positioning late in the season the nets \( 2115 \) have won 12 of their past 15 games , and their threegame losing streak last week seems like a fading memory they now have a fourgame lead over the sixers \( 1820 \) the nets appeared headed for a blowout , going on a 100 spurt early in the third quarter to take a 15point lead when the sixers took a timeout in an attempt to shift the momentum , many of the 15 , 683 fans began to boo but allen iverson singlehandedly brought the sixers back , scoring 11 consecutive points for them to narrow the nets' lead to 6557 he had 19 points in the quarter and finished with a gamehigh 36 carter took over in the fourth quarter , scoring 7 points in the final six minutes to seal the victory vince is the guy who carries us home , coach lawrence frank said he just did a great job delivering the win clifford robinson had 15 points off the bench for the nets , who struggled from the field , shooting 451 percent richard jefferson had a particularly rough game , missing 12 of his 16 shots he finished with 20 points and 16 rebounds , and the nets had only seven turnovers jefferson said he felt rusty after missing last week s losses with back spasms this might be the worst 20point performance i 've ever had of my career , shootingwise , he said the nets also exacted revenge against the sixers in the first meeting of the teams this season , on dec 10 , the nets lost at home , 10795 iverson had 42 points and 12 assists , and kyle korver made 10 of his 11 shots in that game now we 're a different team , jefferson said we knew that , so we came in with that kind of confidence on wednesday , the sixers appeared to be a different team , too iverson was as brilliant as ever , but korver had 8 points , none after halftime john salmons started in his place in an attempt to help the sixers' lackluster defense , even though it was kyle korver bobblehead night iverson , the league s secondleading scorer entering the game \( 332 points a game \) was cold early , making 4 of 12 shots in the first half it was typical of the sixers , who have been inconsistent this season , unable to win consecutive games since middecember jason kidd had 9 points and 9 assists , but his defense on iverson stood out more jkidd was ridiculous on a i jefferson said iverson had 9 points in the fourth quarter , enough to give the sixers one final run the nets scored the first 9 points of the quarter to open a 17point lead , their largest of the game but the sixers charged back , going on a 123 run to cut the nets' lead to 8981 with 4 minutes 22 seconds to play you got to give philly credit , frank said they kept on coming back after a timeout , the nets responded with an 82 run that gave them all the breathing room they needed it s just one win , frank said that was game 36 there are no division titles won this early in the season rebounds lawrence frank was asked before the game if he had any advice for eric mangini , the jets' new coach mangini , who turns 35 on thursday , became the youngest coach in the nfl and the youngest ever hired by the jets frank was 33 when he took over the nets in january 2004 i was told by jeff van gundy , who was told by pat riley , that regardless of age , size or anything , there are usually four components , frank said it comes down to confidence , work ethic , sincerity and trustworthiness frank said that point guard jeff mcinnis would have surgery thursday to repair for torn cartilage in his left knee
i hereby declare this week to be mad scientist week ! in that spirit , i m going experimental over the next five days , i will describe a few experiments i d like to see done , and why the first is to answer this question can taking the oral contraceptive pill change a woman s taste in men \? before i get into that question , however , i d like to say a little about my motivation for the series part of what we know about the world comes from experiments but many important experiments never get done experiments that are very expensive , or that will take years to get results , are often not funded by the public purse ideology gets in the way , too we know far less than we should about human sexuality , for example , because many people shy away from doing the experiments we d need to find the information then , some interesting experiments aren t practical it s much easier for us to conduct experimental evolution on bacteria , some of which have a generation time as short as 20 minutes , than on a fish like the orange roughy , which takes around 25 years to reach maturity finally , ethics prohibit many experiments gone , i hope , are the days of shame the days when surgeons performed head transplants on monkeys \( yes , such experiments were done , and not that long ago unsurprisingly , the transplanted heads died soon after arriving on their new bodies , though at least one of the heads had a chance to bite the finger of a surgeon who was foolish enough to poke it in the mouth \) gone , too , are the days when the us government deliberately irradiated part of the population \( yes , this happened , too \) , or failed to treat people with syphilis just to see how the disease unfolds \( ditto \) but there are still plenty of fascinating experiments that we should do and could do , but haven t yet done for this week s series of columns , i ve picked questions i think are important or just plain interesting and as far as i ve been able to discover still unanswered my aim is to play with ideas and suggest ways to explore the world and so , back to the pill i m prompted to ask the question can taking the oral contraceptive pill change a woman s taste in men \? because of a curious result in 1995 , a team of scientists published what is now universally known as the smelly tshirt experiment in brief the team collected dna from 49 women and 44 men , all students at bern university , in switzerland the dna was then analyzed for a particular set of genes known as the major histocompatibility complex , or mhc these genes are highly variable and are thought to affect several traits , including what you smell like and the workings of your immune system the mhc genes are also suspected to influence whom you find attractive there are two good reasons why this might be the case the first is that members of the same family have similar mhc genes , and it s not a good idea \( at least if you re a mammal some insects are less constrained \) to mate with members of your own family , because it can lead to genetic disorders in the children avoiding people whose mhc genes are like yours may thus help you avoid sex in the family \( not everyone knows their relatives \) second , people with lots of different mhc genes are thought to have immune systems that are better at fighting infectious diseases if your mate had an mhc different from yours , your children would inherit a broader arsenal of weapons for their immune systems , making them more likely to survive diseases because the mhc also affects what you smell like , it is thought that smell might mediate sexiness , with women preferring the smells of men whose mhc genes are different from their own to test this , the men in the swiss study were issued clean white cotton tshirts and told to wear them to bed two nights in a row during this time , the tshirt wearers were asked to abstain from \( among other things \) smoking , sex , garlic and deodorant the day after the second night , the tshirts were put into boxes , and the women were invited to sniff the shirts \( each woman was given six of them \) and rate the smells the results were provocative thirtyone women preferred the smells of men whose genes were different from their own eighteen women did not they liked the smells of people whose genes were more similar to theirs these 18 , it turned out , were all on the pill none of the 31 was provocative but hardly compelling for starters , the number of people involved in the experiment was tiny perhaps those 18 happened to be a bit weird perhaps , if you looked at 10 , 000 women , the results would be different another problem is that the effect of the pill was not tested directly it was invoked to explain an anomaly the effect might have had nothing to do with the pill perhaps the women s desire to take the pill in the first place reflects a wiring of the brain that also somehow determines which smells they would like therefore , i propose an experiment to test the pill directly the basic idea would be to select a large number of women say 1000 of the same age and ethnic group who are not on the pill , and give them the smelly tshirt test then put the same women on the pill \( they should all use the same brand \) , and test them again we d probably also want to control for a possible change in preference over time so we d want half the women to start off on the pill , and then come off , while the others did the reverse this is not a complete design i haven t detailed everything we d want to control for but you get the idea of course , even if the pill were to influence which smells a woman likes , it wouldn t necessarily be that important in deciding whom she mates with woman does not love by smell alone romeo does not always smell of roses indeed , though the smelly tshirt experiment suggested that women like the smells of men with mhc genes different from their own , other research has found that when it comes to choosing someone to marry , there is no evidence that mhc makes a difference a final caveat there is some additional circumstantial evidence to suppose the pill may have an effect a few studies have shown that a woman s desire for sexual activity changes over the course of her menstrual cycle such changes are presumably under hormonal control , and the pill affects hormone levels \( indeed , the pill has been accused of altering the desire for sex , too \) but almost all the studies i know of have involved fewer than 40 people which makes it hard to draw conclusions also , the scientific literature tends to overestimate such effects , because small studies that fail to find an effect often don t get published \( this is the problem of socalled negative results \) but suppose the pill does have a big effect suppose a young woman is on the pill , falls in love , gets married and wants to have children then she comes off the pill and finds she no longer desires her husband if that is true , it is important perhaps we should find out
we were not the first mother and daughter to be arguing over an inheritance i do not feel you have the right to make decisions for my children and my sister s children , and for our children s children , my daughter elisabeth wrote to me i imagine myself as a mother and i know that i would have chosen a very different way of handling the great treasure you were given this battle was not about money , or jewelry , or real estate we were at odds over faded pieces of paper , a precious archive of letters and photographs that were mailed to my mother , sala kirschner , during her five years in nazi slave labor camps she had kept the secrets of these letters for nearly 50 years , breaking her silence only when she was about to undergo cardiac surgery in 1991 until the day she gave me the letters , neither my father , a gi from new york who met the beautiful young survivor named sala garncarz soon after liberation , nor my two brothers knew any more than i did about her once large family , her experiences in the camps or the hundreds of letters that she preserved at great risk my mother recovered from the surgery in the following years , through close reading of the letters and our many conversations , i became acquainted with sala as a young girl , a daring teenager who volunteered for a sixweek posting to a nazi labor camp , taking the place of her sister raizel in the belief that she would get to see something of the world beyond sosnowiec , poland sala s six weeks stretched into five years raizel was her most faithful correspondent in more than a hundred letters , she cherished , admonished and soothed her youngest sister , until raizel , too , was deported , and then nearly killed on a 280mile forced march in the winter of 1945 i also found dozens of love notes from an ardent suitor named harry haubenstock , who gave sala his baby pictures and managed to have a photograph of the two of them taken inside the labor camp there were 31 letters from her friend and mentor ala gertner , whose strength , optimism and intelligence seemed to leap off the pages ala was not only my heroine , but also an important historical figure in 1945 , just three weeks before liberation , she was hanged at auschwitz , one of four women punished for smuggling gunpowder that fueled the only armed uprising at the camp for 10 years , i researched the story behind the letters at the same time , together with my husband , i navigated a complicated life with our three children and two careers i tried to strike a reasonable balance , but sometimes the letters drifted to the back of my mind besides , i was not exactly sure what to do next with them my aunt raizel s death in 2002 jolted me awake for too long , the letters had languished in my closet , nearly as silent they had once been in my mother s house sala had been motivated by fear that the weight of her sad history would compromise her new life in america or poison her children make us somehow not normal as time passed , we no longer needed that protection my next step became obvious finding a permanent home for the collection with my mother s permission , i consulted dozens of libraries and museums and eventually agreed to donate the original letters to the new york public library news of the decision set off a storm of opposition from my children in their view , these letters must never leave the family the needs of nameless strangers , whether historians or the general public , were none of their business they rejected any concern about the physical preservation of the archive , vowing that they would learn how to take care of the delicate papers my proposal to give them high quality digital copies elicited their deepest scorn , as if technology could substitute for the real thing my daughters grew so hot in their objections that one night i took the letters from their usual place and hid them in an empty suitcase , feeling absurd , yet genuinely anxious about thieving children their siege led to unforeseen revelations my father revealed in 2004 that he , too , had a box of letters , bigger than bubbe s , he boasted and it was indeed a bigger box , crammed full of his wartime correspondence within this second box , we eventually found another 56 letters and documents including a diary that sala had kept in the first few weeks of her imprisonment \( why these had been separated from the others remains a mystery \) with the help of this new discovery , we reached a compromise although almost all of the letters became part of the new york public library s permanent collection , i retained enough to give one to each of sala s children , her grandchildren and greatgrandchildren on the night before we delivered the original letters to the library , my daughter caroline turned over each one , as if saying goodbye to a dear friend forever i had been caught unawares in some strange mutation of the echo boom at the very moment that i defined a path for myself , my children came of age as thirdgeneration survivors , confronting their grandmother s history , claiming it and demanding their independence their campaign forced me to acknowledge that more than a little egotism had crept into my decisions over the years my mother had given her letters to me , but my exclusivity was limited it had taken me more than a decade to solve the mysteries of what happened to the nearly 80 correspondents who had written to sala , and to answer the questions of how and where she had received these letters i had taken an active role in the planning of the first public exhibition at new york public library , and i wrote the first book on the letters , sala s gift , which was also my first book yes , i had certainly earned the distinction of being the storyteller with special standing but i would not be the only one the voices of the letters called to me not only because they led my family out of the shadows but also because they emanated from rare historical documents a bridge to history , a time capsule , the letters opened up a direct encounter with my mother s past raw and powerful in their immediacy , the writers' words , even their handwriting , exposed the gradual disintegration of individual lives now my children were listening carefully , not only hearing the darker notes , the heartrending grief of mothers , fathers and children , the sounds of holocaust and war , but also the poignant and unforgettable messages of hope , love and humanity that sustained one young girl photo legacy top

to the editor it is interesting that the formal criticism of defense secretary donald h rumsfeld has come only from retired generals , who have their retirement rank and pension established surely they did n't come to that conclusion only after having retired do none of the generals on active duty have the courage to speak up \? andrew linn peterborough , nh , april 14 , 2006
first of all , let me extend a preemptive apology it s not right that the issue of irish whiskey comes up only in the days leading up to st patrick s day for a whiskey with such a pedigree to be consigned to the category of ethnic celebration not that there s anything wrong with that , as jerry seinfeld used to say pays dutiful lip service to a spirit that deserves much better though no one can prove the legend that whiskey was invented in ireland 1 , 000 years ago or so , it s a fair bet that you could stir things up in a dublin bar by arguing the point scotland may have an equal claim as the originator of whiskey , and may have the upper hand commercially today , but 200 years ago it was irish whiskey that held sway among connoisseurs outside scotland , of course what happened \? in the 19th century the irish whiskey industry was shaken by famine , abstinence movements and new technology that undercut irish distilling methods it survived , but nearly died in the 20th century , when prohibition , conflict with britain and war eliminated its most important export markets yet from its nearly moribund state , the irish whiskey industry has rebounded in the last decade today , as the dining section s tasting panel affirmed , the selection , range and quality of irish whiskeys are probably better than they have been in most people s memory florence fabricant and i were joined by two guests , ethan r kelley , the spirit sommelier at the brandy library in tribeca , and eben klemm , director of cocktail development for b r guest , a restaurant group that includes dos caminos , fiamma and vento we sampled 16 irish whiskeys and found an unexpected variety in this undervalued , underexplored category it was n't a large selection a mere dram compared with the river of whiskey produced by the 100 or so distilleries in scotland irish whiskey has only three distillers midleton and bushmills , both owned by irish distillers , a division of pernod ricard , and the independent cooley , an upstart that was founded in 1987 yet these were distinctive whiskeys for the most part even sibling brands that share a distillery , like cooley s connemara , clontarf and kilbeggan , and midleton s redbreast and tullamore dew , have their own characters and our tasting provided a ready answer to that frequently asked question what s the difference between irish and scotch whiskeys \? in its purest form , irish whiskey has a fresh , lightly fruity , almost meadowlike aroma and flavor that is entirely its own in general , it is lighter in texture than most scotches we sensed these qualities in most of the whiskeys that we liked best , yet today it is difficult to find whiskeys that might have been recognized as irish 150 years ago back then , all irish whiskeys were made in pot stills , the traditional curving copper alembics that are each as beautiful and distinctive in their own way as the whiskeys they produce the whiskey was distilled from barley , a portion of which was malted , or allowed to germinate , which increases the level of sugar in the grain single malt scotch is made entirely from malted barley , but a blend of malted and unmalted barleys , distilled in a pot still , is the classic irish whiskey recipe pot stills are expensive to operate , inefficient and labor intensive , yet they produce spirits of great distinction for today s irish whiskey they are often used in conjunction with column stills , a more efficient technology that was developed in the early 19th century for distilling grains like corn and wheat few irish whiskeys today are produced purely in a pot still , and equally few use the traditional mixture of malted and unmalted barley the only one we found that followed this classic formula was redbreast , a rich , mellow whiskey with plenty of honey and caramel flavor instead , many famous irish names like jameson and powers are blends of potstill barley whiskey and columnstill grain whiskey both are good whiskeys , but they did n't make our cut what s more , an increasing proportion of irish whiskeys , including many of our favorites , are single malts , a term of great marketing value these days because of the prestige and popularity of single malt scotches single malts , made only from malted barley , are not an irish tradition nonetheless , the irish ones retain their character , even the connemara , which has the added and singular irish distinction of being produced from peatsmoked malt , like most singlemalt scotches the connemara , our no 4 whiskey , is a caskstrength bottle , meaning it was not diluted with water at the distillery to reach a strength of 80 proof instead it is bottled out of the cask , at 117 proof if you add a little water , you 'll find a whiskey of remarkable subtlety , with irish grass , floral and heather flavors to go along with the scotchlike smoke our top whiskey was the 10yearold single malt from bushmills many whiskey experts prefer the 16yearold bushmills to the 10year , but we felt the 10year was a purer expression , while the 16year , though delicious , tasted more of barrels than of whiskey we also loved the knappogue castle 1994 single malt , an exceptionally delicate and complex whiskey , while the clontarf , an enjoyable whiskey itself , seemed a shade less complex
to the editor in the space of seven days , i heard reports about three patients who had taken ambien one woke up in the morning to discover she had been binge eating another arose to evidence of nocturnal clothes washing and a third , the wife of an elderly man , reported that her husband had a transient paranoid psychosis in all three instances , none of the patients had any memory of the act i later saw a man who had been pulled over by the police after a number of traffic violations he , too , had complete amnesia of his actions in reviewing the literature and talking to other physicians , i have found similar cases it is significant that these behavioral aberrations occurred at the same time as the peak concentration of ambien in the bloodstream some cases also involved alcohol , but many did not sheldon b cohen , md atlanta , march 11 , 2006

united states government officials said friday that they had asked the owner of a hotel here , which is part of an american corporation , to expel a cuban delegation that was meeting with american oil executives the delegation later left the hotel the request was made by the treasury department s office of foreign assets control , which told starwood hotels , the owner of the sheraton maria isabel in mexico city , that american law prohibited it from supplying services to cuban individuals or companies the move is the latest in what seems be a hardening by the bush administration of the trade embargo against cuba a spokeswoman for the treasury department , molly millerwise , said , the hotel acted in accordance with us sanctions a spokeswoman for starwood hotels , nadeen ayala , confirmed that the treasury department had asked the hotel to have the cuban nationals leave cuban officials are trying to court american petroleum companies to produce oil in the nation s territorial waters after succeeding in attracting exploratory investments from chinese , indian and norwegian energy companies the meeting of largely texan oil executives and elite bureaucrats from havana began thursday and was to end saturday it s outrageous that i , as an american citizen , ca n't go and talk to someone on mexican soil , said kirby jones , a former world bank official and the organizer of the meeting for the uscuba trade association , a nonprofit group in washington mr jones said this was the 10th meeting he had organized between american executives and cuban officials , although it was the first to focus on opportunities for american energy companies in cuba previous meetings had resulted in sales of american food products to cuba this week s meeting , mr jones said , was originally scheduled for december in canc \? mexico , but was rescheduled for mexico city other meetings had been at hotels controlled by american companies , he said , including a hotel in canc \? where the energy meeting was originally scheduled in december this issue has never come up , mr jones said the american executives will try to meet with the cubans at another location on saturday some of the largest american oil companies , including exxon mobil and the valero energy corporation , had agreed to meet with cuban officials on what was thought to be neutral ground at a hotel here in the cradle of mexican capitalism , a short stroll on paseo de la reforma from a starbucks , the united states embassy and mexico s stock exchange the oilimporting port of corpus christi and american shipping and oil field equipment companies also sent representatives they 're sensing a lost opportunity in their own backyard , less than 100 miles from the florida coast , said mr jones although cuba has suffered from energy shortages since the soviet union halted subsidized oil shipments more than a decade ago , its potential as an oil producer has caught attention according to the energy information administration , cuba s proven oil reserves of 750 million barrels exceed those of sudan , an african nation that has lured large nonamerican investments to its oil industry despite american economic sanctions in place since 1997 we have absolutely no limitations on working with american oil companies the barriers , unfortunately , come from the other side , said alberto wong calvo , director of hydrocarbons at the national office of mineral resources in cuba oil production in cuba has surged since an opening to foreign investment in the 1990 s , with operations by two canadian companies , the sherritt international corporation and pebercan inc , helping to increase output to about 70 , 000 barrels a day in 2005 from a low of 18 , 000 barrels a day in 1992 cuba consumes more than 150 , 000 barrels a day , with venezuela providing imports on favorable financial terms the american economic embargo on dealings with cuba prohibits energy companies from reaching exploration deals with uni \?

four thousand fans cheered for the bulls last sunday at passaic high school s boverini stadium , but none of them were there to watch a varsity football game instead , the stadium was the site of a rodeo that was approved by the town s board of education but that led to complaints from some parents that the bulls had torn up parts of the football field and left piles of manure vincent capuana , the school board president , who spearheaded a special vote by the board to waive policies barring forprofit groups from holding a circus , carnival or animal show at the stadium , said that he inspected the field the morning after the rodeo and that the damage was minimal and bull droppings nonexistent people have been complaining , but most of the field was still in good shape , and there was not one piece of garbage on it when i walked through , said mr capuana , who lives opposite the stadium he said that the company that ran the event , oaxaca mexico products , of passaic , provided a 10 million insurance policy just in case repairs needed to be made , but all we really need to do is add some topsoil to a few areas of the field that were torn up and are now filled with mud mr capuana said he pushed for the rodeo because passaic has a large hispanic population , including many mexicans the school district received 400 for the event our stadium is a part of our community , he said it s for everybody the team s coach , tom elsasser , did not return calls seeking comment about the condition of the field but an assistant coach , who would not give his name , said that the passaic varsity was practicing on a side field at the stadium on thursday as maintenance crews worked to get the main field in shape for the team s home opener against paramus on sept 23 vincent m mallozzi
secretary of state condoleezza rice departed sunday for the middle east , on a trip billed by aides as an effort to bolster the embattled palestinian authority president , mahmoud abbas , in his struggles with the militant islamic group hamas , and to consult with arab allies on iran s nuclear program and the turmoil in iraq the state department sought to play down expectations for ms rice s trip , her first to the region since an agreement brokered by the united nations ended the onemonth war between israel and hezbollah this summer during her last visit , in july , ms rice was criticized by arab leaders for failing to move quickly to try to end the violence then raging along the israelilebanese border the state department spokesman , sean mccormack , said this week s trip , scheduled to begin in saudi arabia and to include stops in egypt , israel and the west bank , was not likely to produce any major steps forward for american policies in the middle east these meetings are more about consultations , taking stock of where we are , he said on her visit to the west bank , she is expected to meet with mr abbas , his third meeting in less than three weeks with bush administration officials during meetings in new york last month on the sidelines of the united nations general assembly , president bush praised mr abbas as a a man of courage for his efforts to make peace with israel and bring order to the palestinian territories but the united states has signaled it has no plans to resume financial aid to the beleaguered palestinians unless hamas , which won elections in january and controls the government , takes steps to recognize israel and forswear violence moves that the group s leaders have rejected , despite pressure from mr abbas in remarks last week to the editorial board of the new york times , ms rice praised mr abbas , saying he needed time to sort through what he wants to do despite her absence from washington , ms rice seemed most likely to be dogged from a distance this week about descriptions of her actions in a new book by the reporter bob woodward , especially about his report that ms rice rebuffed warnings from the central intelligence agency two months before the sept 11 attacks about an imminent strike by al qaeda mr woodward said the starkest warnings were made in a july 10 , 2001 , meeting in the white house between ms rice , then the national security adviser , and george j tenet , then the director of central intelligence through spokesmen , she has rejected mr woodward s account of the meeting , saying mr tenet did not issue such a blunt warning at the meeting and expressed none of the frustration attributed to him in the book
paul krugman responds to readers comments on his sept 15 column ,  donald green , md , reading , mass your article is in sync with a personal view from one who is not an economist , but an ardent observer of the social scene people who are traditionalists want to look backwards and measure progress by what has been in the past people who are progressive look across the expanse of what the present culture produces and assess how many citizens are enjoying its benefits on one side , survival is measured by mutual benefit on the other , it is measured by a distinctive tribal benefit the main question is this do we leave our hunter prey legacy behind , or do we embrace a social contract based on our reasoning power \? the clash of these two concepts is what , i believe , produces the ambiguity you have so clearly laid out in today s article ted , oxford , ohio is it written somewhere in the history of modern america that the standard of living should rise with each successive generation \? isn t there some point adjusted for inflation so that each succeeding generation can live at the same scale as their predecessors \? the assumption that each generation should be better off than their previous generation sounds like an unsustainable path , because an increase in standard of living usually goes along with increased consumption as i look around my typical american suburban subdivision , i have no problem finding three and fourcar families in my formative years two was not necessarily the norm , and three was a definite luxury there are also boats and other recreational vehicles , and yards filled with pools , trampolines , kids wooden playsets , etc none of which i saw in my old neighborhood where i grew up despite your contention that we maybe regressing , i find no sign of it and i am at the heart of middle class america on the other hand , my parents definitely made more money than i do now but they also worked 84 hours a week vs my 40hour work week to me , being able to live on my current solidly middle class income of 50 , 000 year , and having a sane work schedule , is definitely an improvement over my parents standard of living paul krugman from the description , i suspect your neighborhood is higher on the economic scale than you apparently think americans with incomes of roughly 20 , 000 to 400 , 000 a year tend to think of themselves as middle class , but the typical nonelderly family is in the 50 , 000 to 60 , 000 a year range and that s not the range in which people have three or four cars , boats , and so on and it has been a long time since the typical american worked 80plus hours in fact , we haven t had a major reduction in work hours or increase in vacation time during the period of wage stagnation paul schremp , tucson , ariz technology and technological advances never create jobs quite the contrary , they diminish the work force and lower salaries always have , always will samantha wolf , stafford springs , conn i m a software engineer i have been in this field for the past 16 years and definitely fall into the regress category the it industry enjoyed massive growth during the mid to late90 s employees , contractors and consultants reaped significant personal gain employers were outraged at the salaries and contract rates they had to pay to get even minimally qualified people , as demand far exceeded supply at that time in december 2000 , i was billing at 125 hour and was considered a bargain , as most of my colleagues were in the 200300 hour range three weeks later in january of 2001 , the best rate i could negotiate was 75 hour or approximately 150 , 000 year still very decent money , but a lot less than just a month before in october of 2003 , the best contract rate i could get was 15 hour , or roughly 30 , 000 year from 2001 to 2003 , my very real income fell from 250 , 000 year to 30 , 000 annually i had gained even more experience , was considered at the top of my field and yet was compensated at rock bottom prices it jobs were sent in record numbers to india , ireland and china as employers exacted a kind of revenge and savored extreme profitability against paying the big dollars from five years earlier today , my income has drifted upward to 50 hour , or about 100 , 000 year and has stabilized there as it schools have closed , many in it still remain out of work and demand is once again beginning to outpace supply concurrently , real prices rose and still continue upward significantly as my real income fell groceries , prescriptions , gas prices , other energy costs , insurance premiums all are up to record levels my story is the same for everyone i know in it , and is also true for other hardhit industries such as transportation , manufacturing , medical , realestate , telecom and now , the entertainment industry all have been impacted , and not necessarily for the same reasons the bottom line is that , if i have less disposable income to spend , eventually commerce and industry will feel the effects of my cutting back multiply my story by millions and this is why people are gloomy about the economy productivity is through the roof because decentpaying jobs are scarce despite the published numbers , and there is keen competition for them employers have driven workers to produce if a worker fails to perform , there is always someone else waiting in line to take that job the end result is that workers today are driven hard , paid less and have fewer benefits than even five years ago no amount of pr is ever going to convince people that they are simply imagining economic hardship
we were not the first mother and daughter to be arguing over an inheritance i do not feel you have the right to make decisions for my children and my sister s children , and for our children s children , my daughter elisabeth wrote to me i imagine myself as a mother and i know that i would have chosen a very different way of handling the great treasure you were given this battle was not about money , or jewelry , or real estate we were at odds over faded pieces of paper , a precious archive of letters and photographs that were mailed to my mother , sala kirschner , during her five years in nazi slave labor camps she had kept the secrets of these letters for nearly 50 years , breaking her silence only when she was about to undergo cardiac surgery in 1991 until the day she gave me the letters , neither my father , a gi from new york who met the beautiful young survivor named sala garncarz soon after liberation , nor my two brothers knew any more than i did about her once large family , her experiences in the camps or the hundreds of letters that she preserved at great risk my mother recovered from the surgery in the following years , through close reading of the letters and our many conversations , i became acquainted with sala as a young girl , a daring teenager who volunteered for a sixweek posting to a nazi labor camp , taking the place of her sister raizel in the belief that she would get to see something of the world beyond sosnowiec , poland sala s six weeks stretched into five years raizel was her most faithful correspondent in more than a hundred letters , she cherished , admonished and soothed her youngest sister , until raizel , too , was deported , and then nearly killed on a 280mile forced march in the winter of 1945 i also found dozens of love notes from an ardent suitor named harry haubenstock , who gave sala his baby pictures and managed to have a photograph of the two of them taken inside the labor camp there were 31 letters from her friend and mentor ala gertner , whose strength , optimism and intelligence seemed to leap off the pages ala was not only my heroine , but also an important historical figure in 1945 , just three weeks before liberation , she was hanged at auschwitz , one of four women punished for smuggling gunpowder that fueled the only armed uprising at the camp for 10 years , i researched the story behind the letters at the same time , together with my husband , i navigated a complicated life with our three children and two careers i tried to strike a reasonable balance , but sometimes the letters drifted to the back of my mind besides , i was not exactly sure what to do next with them my aunt raizel s death in 2002 jolted me awake for too long , the letters had languished in my closet , nearly as silent they had once been in my mother s house sala had been motivated by fear that the weight of her sad history would compromise her new life in america or poison her children make us somehow not normal as time passed , we no longer needed that protection my next step became obvious finding a permanent home for the collection with my mother s permission , i consulted dozens of libraries and museums and eventually agreed to donate the original letters to the new york public library news of the decision set off a storm of opposition from my children in their view , these letters must never leave the family the needs of nameless strangers , whether historians or the general public , were none of their business they rejected any concern about the physical preservation of the archive , vowing that they would learn how to take care of the delicate papers my proposal to give them high quality digital copies elicited their deepest scorn , as if technology could substitute for the real thing my daughters grew so hot in their objections that one night i took the letters from their usual place and hid them in an empty suitcase , feeling absurd , yet genuinely anxious about thieving children their siege led to unforeseen revelations my father revealed in 2004 that he , too , had a box of letters , bigger than bubbe s , he boasted and it was indeed a bigger box , crammed full of his wartime correspondence within this second box , we eventually found another 56 letters and documents including a diary that sala had kept in the first few weeks of her imprisonment \( why these had been separated from the others remains a mystery \) with the help of this new discovery , we reached a compromise although almost all of the letters became part of the new york public library s permanent collection , i retained enough to give one to each of sala s children , her grandchildren and greatgrandchildren on the night before we delivered the original letters to the library , my daughter caroline turned over each one , as if saying goodbye to a dear friend forever i had been caught unawares in some strange mutation of the echo boom at the very moment that i defined a path for myself , my children came of age as thirdgeneration survivors , confronting their grandmother s history , claiming it and demanding their independence their campaign forced me to acknowledge that more than a little egotism had crept into my decisions over the years my mother had given her letters to me , but my exclusivity was limited it had taken me more than a decade to solve the mysteries of what happened to the nearly 80 correspondents who had written to sala , and to answer the questions of how and where she had received these letters i had taken an active role in the planning of the first public exhibition at new york public library , and i wrote the first book on the letters , sala s gift , which was also my first book yes , i had certainly earned the distinction of being the storyteller with special standing but i would not be the only one the voices of the letters called to me not only because they led my family out of the shadows but also because they emanated from rare historical documents a bridge to history , a time capsule , the letters opened up a direct encounter with my mother s past raw and powerful in their immediacy , the writers' words , even their handwriting , exposed the gradual disintegration of individual lives now my children were listening carefully , not only hearing the darker notes , the heartrending grief of mothers , fathers and children , the sounds of holocaust and war , but also the poignant and unforgettable messages of hope , love and humanity that sustained one young girl photos legacy top

the bagger was talking last night with someone about something besides the academy awards despite current appearances , the bagger has other interests but then the person on the other end of the phone made the mistake of mentioning that he was a member of the academy in fact , i have the ballot right in front of me , he said soooooooooooo , whoyavotin fer \? asked the bagger in his most solicitous voice the caller pointed out that there was a prohibition from talking to the media right on the front of the ballot undaunted , the bagger bored in with a merciless line of questioning that has become something of a trademark for him actually , he pleaded and promised anonymity , but whose keeping track \? the caller , like a lot of people that he talks to in los angeles , said he would be giving crash his best picture vote , not brokeback mountain the man said he had no problem with the gay themes at the heart of the ang lee film , but just that he found he saw the film as highly derivative of douglas sirk s films in the 1950 s of thwarted love between doomed souls i just found crash to be a far more original movie he said that he would have liked to have been voting for a big studio movie he used to be part of one of its hulking components but they just didn t give us anything to choose from this year most of the movies this year are small and intellectual sort of like jon stewart , come to think of it the caller laughed at that one , but he also laughed at the bagger s assertion that the academy was sending a message i suppose if i had to write a blog about the oscars , i d be talking a lot about that , but i don t believe that happens much i have been voting for the oscars for over 20 years and i can t ever recall voting to send a message i always vote for the movie that sounds oldfashioned , i suppose and most of my friends do the same thing i suppose that doesn t lend itself to a lot of analysis , but that s the way it is the bagger listened very carefully and then immediately discarded the thought , worried that it would create the kind of dissonance that might paralyze him for the rest of the oscar season so , to review the oscars matter very much , they are an issue of profound cultural moment , and the voters mark their ballots with the heavy realization that they are sending manifest and profound messages with every single mark photo don cheadle , left , and the director paul haggis on the set of crash \( lions gate films \)

i don t know what s more humiliating , scoring to make it 4917 or this gesture of pity nbc is showing parcells s sour puss on the sideline twominute warning start of fourth quarter incomplete pass , one of the few by brees , who has been laserlike in his precision timeout , new orleans a swing pass to bush is incomplete , and for the saints , a rare punt newman a nice return to near midfield a flag , of course , a block in the back by dallas 10 yards will be taken off the return very choppy play we ve seen a bunch of flags and timeouts , but if you bat an eyelash , you miss a 50yard td pass by brees ok , back from commercial , and romo throws incomplete his numbers will be ugly after this one romo lets it fly again , and he makes a beautiful deep pass to to it goes right through his hands it was over his shoulder , but still very catchable , and the dallas crowd boos now owens makes a firstdown catch to make amends barber gets it on a draw and goes nowhere glenn catches it before getting splattered at midfield , first down 12 52 left romo rolls out , trips over his own feet and is swallowed by the pass rush for an 8yard loss another desperate bomb by romo , and owens , doublecovered , can t find the ball in the lights witten with a short catch at midfield fourth down dallas , resigned to defeat , punts with 11 11 left 42 , 4th quarter saints start at their 20 after the pick deuce runs up the middle for a few end of the third quarter 3 47 , 3rd quarter it s been one roundhouse punch after another by the saints , and i think the cowboys are officially knocked out ! austin runs it back again and fumbles , but cowboys recover at the 33 romo lets one fly ! owens is open , and there s an interference flag after a drop oops , penalty is waved off and romo tries another bomb , incomplete 3 08 left romo finds glenn over the middle for 18 nice catch in traffic a dumpoff pass to julius jones for a first down another catch by glenn , to the saint 19 witten makes a catch and fights off several tackles to get to the 12 nohuddle for dallas , and the plays are coming fast romo is hit as he throws , incomplete thirdand5 , and the saints call timeout and now romo calls a timeout , not liking what he sees in the saints alignment glenn catches it but is out of bounds on the end zone would have been a penalty on the line anyway fourth down romo scrambles , incomplete , another penalty , this time on the saints fourth and inches from the 8 false start by dallas , a comical series of penalties by both teams romo intercepted by jason craft in the end zone , intended for witten 5 00 , 3rd quarter who is mike karney \? does anybody have him on his fantasy team \? can t be an onside kick attempt \? ! and new orleans recovers ! what a gutsy call ! dallas was playing back , and payton risks everything on it the saints recover , so it looks brilliant , but that could have been a big momentum swinger for dallas payton is sticking it to parcells now colston with a short catch an incomplete pass by brees third and 5 brees finds billy miller , who is replacing an injured mark campbell what ! another touchdown brees lets fly from the dallas 42 , and henderson skies between two cowboys for the catch and falls down at the 4 before the 2 cowboys can reach him , henderson slithers crawls lunges into the end zone touchdown ! extra point is good , and now it s 4217 3 47 to go in the quarter 7 40 , 3rd quarter lewis runs it back to the 38 deuce bulls to the saint 45 a couple of more yards by deuce , to the 48 a brees bomb a perfect strike on a lofted pass by brees , all the way to the 3 on a catch by devery henderson a 49yarder it s one big play after another in this quarter deuce almost gets in from the 3 , stopped at the 1 and then deuce dives for an easy score dallas can t stop the saints wait ! a whistle before the play an illegal substitution scratch the td , and back up the saints 5 yards karney catches a short pass and dives for the pylon very close to a td payton throws his challenge flag he thinks it s a td there s 5 02 left in the quarter this is a big call if it s a td , it s going to be 3517 after the review , it s a td they say the ball touched the pylon karney has his third td of the game after coming into the game with none for his career extra point is good , 3517 well , a crazy swing in the game thomas didn t need to intercept the ball it was fourth down he could have batted it down instead , he tried to catch it and it went right through his hands , deflecting into to s grasp now madden is saying that thomas is playing with a cast on his hand still , whack the ball into the ground ! 9 59 , 3rd quarter miles austin runs it out to the 38 , a nice return romo finds glenn for another big gain , to the saint 38 but they re gonna need a td here they can t trade fg s for td s marion barber gets a carry but doesn t do much with it short pass to tight end third and 8 incomplete , pass deflected romo wants to go for it on fourth down 7 53 left dallas is going for it ! almost intercepted turns into a touchdown ! fred thomas went for the pick and it goes right through his hands to to , who waltzes in a total fluke td extra point is good , and it s 2817 11 20 , 3rd quarter michael lewis returns the kickoff to the 23 brees goes to work , faking a handoff and dumping off to a wideopen karney for a 9yard gain karney again for a first down bush gets loose weaving , dodging touchdown it was off a screen pass , and he escaped an ankle tackle and then he was off it covers 61 yards bush had 4 td s last week , and he is finally justifying the billing the cowboys are reeling , the crowd stunned it s 2810 after carney s point after start of third quarter cowboys miles austin returns to the dallas 28 on the kickoff amid a cloud of smoke from the pyrotechnic display at halftime jones runs up the middle for 3 yards and a cloud of smoke a big gainer to terry glenn romo playfakes and hits glenn on the sideline , and he scoots for a 50yard gain julius jones runs up the middle for 3 to gets his first catch , a shortie to the 10 ball at the saints 8 jones gets 3 more yards up the middle to the 6 second and goal romo sprints out , then tries to zip it into witten s chest , but it bounces off third and goal an awful pass should have been intercepted by mackenzie pass was intended for crayton and was bungled by mackenzie a 34yard attempt from gramatica is good , cutting the dallas deficit to 2110 taking baton at halftime thanks , jeff i feel like a backup quarterback coming in for the starter kinda like romo replacing bledsoe at halftime of the giants game that didn t go so well for dallas , and romo has cratered here probably his worst game of the year his halftime stats 4 of 11 for 44 yards with no tds and 1 interception he s been completely outplayed by brees \( 19 for 28 for 119 yards with 2td s and no interceptions \) if dallas loses , it will be the latest socalled elite team to be upset today seattle lost to arizona indy lost to jacksonville and new england lost to miami halftime changeover the changing of the guard ceremony , in which i relinquish control of the commentary to my able colleague toni monkovic toni will try to stay cynical for you , if that s what you like give the people what they want , sez i ! thanks for following along and now , heeeeeeere s toni ! 0 01 , second quarter brees in to take a knee and he does , and the half is over ! and the saints fans at texas stadium give their club a big cheer as they run off to the dressing room halftime new orleans 21 , dallas 7  06 , second quarter they re going to try a play without a timeout ! romo back to pass looks to the end zone and glenn ! but overthrows too closely covered so now gramatica will try a 43yarder it s up and wide right by a foot ! no good 0 11 , second quarter second down from the 42 of the saints romo rifles over the middle caught ! by glenn ! who is speared to ground dallas must take their last timeout but the cowboys are on the saints 25 0 19 , second quarter first down from the no 45 romo scrambles and goes down ! he takes timeout 0 31 , second quarter romo hits for an 8yarder timeout , dallas from their own 46 now and a whistle false start so second and 8 now cfl set , no one in the backfield romo rifles it too far on a pass over the middle incomplete but late flag unsportsmanlike conduct for taunting against saints cb mike mckenzie ! he was talking to terrell owens owens s only contribution to the game so far 0 44 , second quarter it was safetyback roy williams who missed the tackle i think jones was running in his blind spot , because williams was running up to intercept , but th eball never reached the spot williams was running to so then he was out of position to make the tackle the kickoff is returned well by austin up his favorite lane , the sideline , to the dallas 39 0 44 , second quarter so the upshot is that it ll be third and 5 for the saints on the dallas 27 brees to throw over the middle touchdown ! jamal jones catches on the 3 , breaks an arm tackle , and steps in for the td ! and now the convert from carney it s good ! new orleans 21 , dallas 7  0 50 , second quarter pretty clearly it was a fumble that jones himself recovers but we re going to have to wait forever anyway now the ruling incomplete but dallas are also given an unsportsmanlike conduct flag for the mere act of throwing the replay flag which is illegal inside the twominute mark this is completely asinine 0 50 , second quarter spectacular block on that last play by bush he flipped the blitzing lb burnett a over teakettle now second and long caught over the middle for a first down by jamal jones but as he s tackled he drops it ! surely this will be challenged and yes , it is now comes the most boring exercise in any sport , the interminable pause for the officials video review 1 00 , second quarter second and 10 colston leaves the game with a cramp so the saints have taken their last timeout brees to henderson , good for a first down , but a penalty to henderson for offensive pass interference 1 00 , second quarter from the dallas 32 cfl set brees back to pass , looks to the end zone to henderson but incomplete too closely covered by anthony henry 1 00 , second quarter brees to bush , broken field ! he rambles and scrambles for 25 yards ! brees was caught behind the line , started to run up the middle , then got caught and dumped it to the short man , bush who took off across the field and found big yards timeout for the saints first and 10 ! 1 58 , second quarter reader mac checks in to pronounce himself proballast as opposed to antibalas as opposed to antidallas many layers here so much meaning first and 10 from their own 38 for no mcallister up the middle for about 5 1 58 , second quarter saints on their 26 flare to bush he follows his lone blocker , jon stinchcomb and gets 11 before being taken down ! great play by ot stinchcomb ! and now the twominute warning 2 30 , second quarter mc allister gets 3 up the middle second down , mcallister again for another 5 to the 13yard line third and 2 ! two in the backfield fake brees rolls , a leaping throw , caught by colston ! nice snare on a high ball while he was getting whacked first down ! 4 04 , second quarter huge punt by mcbriar , fielded with room by reggie bush on the 5 and the skinny guy , miles austen , makes the tackle on the 4 great play ! but on the replay , we see that he facemasked bush but no call 4 20 , second quarter what a duel that was between fujita and romo second down , jones gets 3 third and 6 romo rolls and throws , but knocked away by the secondary saints hold ! mcbriar to punt ! 6 00 , second quarter dallas from their 27 another huge hole for julius jones ! he gets 10 yards for a first down almost broke it ! great trap blocking in the middle first down romo to throw , but scott fujita up to block romo holds , fujita follows another pump , fujita leaps again now romo tries to run , an dfujita tackles him gain of 1 ! 6 33 , second quarter a fine punt form weatherford taken with room by newman , but the pursuit stays with him , and despite running the width of the field , he gets about 1 yard on the return 7 30 , second quarter brees over the middle to mcallister for 5 favorite name tonight dallas lb junior glymph mcallister up the middle on a draw , but short of the first down time for a punt 8 00 , second quarter saints will start from their tk al michaels with some treacle about drew brees helping new orleans recover from katrina that s what drew brees exudes , john madden tells us can we restart the game already \? ok , from their own 17 brees over the middle , but miller was too closely covered by ayodele 8 04 , second quarter reader mike demet writes in to suggest that giving the ball to reggie bush will make dallas fold but yo , mike , it s mike karney getting that ball that s making dallas fold and deuce mcallister a very balanced attack for saints , led by a very confidentlooking drew brees 8 15 , second quarter romo in the face of a heavy threeman rush he stands in bravely , but overthrows as he takes a lick and dallas were guilty of holding anyway but declined , and it s fourth down mcbriar s punt is fair caught but wait ! a saint ran into mcbriar it was steve gleason who did it but since it s a minor penalty of five yards , the ball stays with the saints 9 10 , second quarter jones again to the saints 45 second and 5 backs in the i romo to pass , but he s chased and dropped ! will smith makes the tackle ! a loss of 10 to set up third and 15 ! 10 20 , second quarter our secondhalf playbyplay commentator on this blog , toni monkovic , asks whether you readers are dallas or antidallas \( as opposed to antibalas , which is something else altogether \) i think he s onto something popular as they are , no team is as despised as dallas they re like the manchester united of the us or actually , chelsea these days that s to put it into a context those of you reading along at 3 in the morning in the uk can follow jones up the middle , good run for 11 10 20 , second quarter how bout them saints \? not only are they winning , texas stadium sounds like it s in new orleans now the kickoff , goes out of bounds on the 2 that ll give the ball to dallas on their own 40 a break for the cowboys ! 10 20 , second quarter first and goal caught over the middle by mcallister to the 1 second and goal brees to throw to mike karney for the td ! another touchdown for the reserve fullback ! and the convert from john carney is good !

picked off by stoutmire ! he gets it to the dallas 43 ! 14 53 , second quarter touchdown saints ! mike karney on a run off tackle , goes in untouched ! and the convert by carney is good ! new orleans 7 , dallas 7  sorry we had a glitch here and missed a couple of plays in short , the cowboys , actually ware , were guilty of trying to draw the saints offside dallas subbed in six players , then five , which prompted to me to say that pro football has gotten sort of ridiculous , and then karney scored 15 00 , second quarter brees throws for the end zone , but anthony henry breaks it up with a diving save ! 0 00 , first quarter first and goal ! bush to the right side of the line good for 3 yards time runs out on the period , with the score dallas 7 , new orleans 0  0 30 , first quarter first and 10 brees fakes a throw left , and he fakes a throw right , and then he twirls around and throws to the te campbell , who catches at the 8 and is upended , somersaulting through the air first and goal ! campbell limps off 1 00 , first quarter first down dallas offside , so first and 5 handoff to bush , and he hurtles to the first down at the dallas 20 ! 2 18 , first quarter the line is stacked but it s a reverse ! terrance copper , forced back by ware ! but he gets away , and another cowboy falls down and copper turns the corner and just barely does get the first down weird play ! 3 30 , first quarter third and 9 slant pattern , hits colston but he gets to within half a yard of the first down not quite good enough what will no do \? they re gonna go for it ! 3 00 , first quarter bush on the draw , but he hesitates and gets absorbed by chris canty second down dropped ! newman knocks it out of bush s hands on the flare pass ! 4 30 , first quarter mcallister wrapped up at the line of scrimmage now a flare pass to karney and he gets 11 ! the saints are on the dallas 49 first down ! 5 00 , first quarter from the 29 , a swing pass to reggie bush , and he follows his blockers and rolls for 12 easy yards first down , saints ! 6 30 , first quarter brees in a pro set drops back , hits mike karney over the middle for 8 and now the handoff to karney , and he gets another 8 , this time on the ground first down ! 6 30 , first quarter mat mcbriar on to punt puts it high it must be faircaught by moneyball author michael lewis on the 12 and that s where new orleans will take over , first and 10 6 40 , first quarter third and 6 shotgun romo again flings sidearm , but it was way overthrown at the sideline to glenn 8 00 , first quarter from the 44 , handoff to jones no 77yard run this time he s smothered for the loss of a yard second down pitched back to jones , into the middle of the line maybe 3 yards 9 00 , first quarter romo takes the snap for dallas on the 26 , fades straight back , flings nonchalantly to te whitten , complete ! gain of 15 romo so confident the coverage on whitten was pretty close , yet the ball was right on target 9 07 , first quarter third and 3 brees s pass for colston is incomplete it was a buttonhook , but the receiver , colston , slipped on the curl move so a punt from weatherford taken on the 25 by creighton gets a yard or two off the 36yard punt and it ll be dallas s ball there 9 30 , first quarter quick pass to bush almost picked off by a darting db , but bush catches , slips three tackles , and gains 7 ! second down no huddle quick pass to colston , but he can t hold on woulda been enough for the first 10 20 , first quarter third and 4 pass over the middle caught by mcallister , a 6yard gain for a first down 11 50 , first quarter saints from their 20 pitch back to deuce mcallister , but it only goes for 4 second down one man in the backfield it s mcallister again , another 2 yards 12 06 , first quarter that was just a simple handoff up the middle , the way was closed , so jones sidestepped to his left , and there was a huge hole ! and no one there , so he just ran , untouched , all the way ! there was a bunch of people following him , but they could not catch him so now gramatica kicks off again taken on the 5 by lewis and he fumbles ! there s a scramble for the ball no signal yet and finally , it s the saints who have it 13 20 , first quarter dallas coming off a 2320 win at the giants last week the saints coming off a 3410 deconstruction of san francisco tony romo from the 21 , throws short to glenn , goes for about 2 second and 8 draw to julius jones he s broken it big ! he s through a hole and there s no one can catch him ! he s gonna go all the way ! touchdown ! 77 yards for julius jones ! and the convert is good dallas 7 , new orleands 0  13 20 , first quarter steve weatherford in to punt a big kick ! fair caught by the cowboys a 56yard punt ! 14 11 , first quarter second and 10 , saints on their 24 brees fades back , and he s snowed under ! demarcus ware gets the sack ! third and about 17 brees with time , goes to his third choice , reggie bush , in the flat he runs forward and gets poleaxed down on a nice tackle by terence newman sixyard gain time to punt 14 30 , first quarter marques colston catches over the middle from drew brees for 11 yards and a first down but campbell drops the next pass the kickoff 48 degrees in irving tonight \( finally , al michaels said something useful \) now to andrea kremer on the sideline , saying something anyone could ve said without us having to go to andrea kremer on the sideline please , can we kick off already \? now martin gramatica does kick off , and michael lewis , author of liar s poker , returns to the 29 but a penalty against the saints puts them back to their 14 first down kill me before they do michaels and madden drone on with a series of bromides meant to set up tonight s game star power in the lone star state , michaels intones by way of intro to a series of graphics telling us who tonight s sponsors are now the truck commercial with john cougar mellencamp singing about the ideals i think are right that would be football , america and the truck company that s paying him to sing this drivel the kickoff impends new orleans will be wearing black shirts and black pants , which is a shame , because they look like just about any team when they re outfitted like this the ravens \? the jags \? i dunno some vaguely southern team dallas will be in their usual white shirts and silver pants and now the pomposity gets under way not mine , mind you nbc s they start with a cringeinducing shot of tony romo saying how he can t wait for the game to start then a cringeinducing animation of big cities and pink singing some insipid song about sunday night football and kicking and punching at the camera in an effort to look disarmingly toughyetcute this is going to be difficult pregame greetings hello again , nfl fans around the globe i and my aching wrists are back after having brought you the live blowbyblow of the buffalo bills surprising destruction of the new york jets just one more surprising result , it was , on a day full of surprising results this game tonight cannot yield a surprising result two evenly matched sides , both at 84 and with a 15game lead in their respective divisions but an important contest for sure the winner will be two games up on their closest pursuers the loser will be only one game ahead however , one thing is certain about tonight s game the tv commentators , al michaels and john madden , and the overall production of the telecast in general , is sure to be annoying and hard to watch whereas watching ian eagle and solomon wilcots on cbs s jetsbills telecast was a pleasure for their unobtrusiveness and lack of pomposity
in his campaign of relentless positive thinking anything to distract from a poor record isiah thomas has pointed to the schedule and injuries as reasons for a slow start , and he has insisted the knicks can only be better as they move into december the rhetoric has occasionally veered into the absurd as the losses have piled up the knicks would perhaps be better off simply highlighting the biggest , most obvious sign of hope they have and at 6 feet 11 inches and 285 pounds , eddy curry should be hard to miss playing his second season as a knick , curry is starting to leave massive footprints at madison square garden , none bigger than in saturday night s 115107 victory against the milwaukee bucks curry left divots all over the court last night , scoring a careerhigh 36 points to stretch his streak of 20point games to nine an appreciative home crowd , desperate for encouraging signs and someone worth cheering , gave curry a partial standing ovation when he checked out for good , with 191 seconds left a brief chant of eddy broke out , which segued into cheers as the final seconds expired it will take several more such efforts , and some playoff victories , before curry earns a place alongside the knicks' legendary big men but statistically , he is already in good company curry s streak of 20point games is the longest by a knick in nearly nine years since allan houston posted 10 in a row from jan 26 to feb 17 , 1998 among knicks centers , he has the best streak in more than a decade patrick ewing had 13 consecutive 20point games from april 10 , 1994 to nov 12 , 1994 curry was electric in the third quarter , as the knicks expanded their lead to 17 points from 3 he had 14 points in the period , scoring on dunk after dunk after dunk but it was at the other end of the court that curry at last won some love from the home crowd in a matter of minutes , he blocked a dunk attempt by bucks center andrew bogut and a layup attempt by ruben patterson in between , david lee also swatted a patterson layup as the knicks pulled away for what seemed to be a rout in the making but the knicks' offense sputtered in the fourth quarter , and curry , who had manhandled bogut and dan gadzuric , was rattled by the physical defense of brian skinner curry scored only 4 points in the final quarter , and his frustration nearly boiled over as he complained to the referees during a late timeout , curry got an animated lecture from the official bennett salvatore curry went 17 for 24 from the field , and he also had nine rebounds the knicks \( 814 \) won for only the third time in 11 home games and improved to 23 in december the victory was dampened by another injury to a key player stephon marbury left the game early in the third quarter with a left forearm contusion and he did not return xrays were negative the knicks were already without three starters , including steve francis , marbury s backcourt partner francis is resting a tendinitisstricken knee and is expected to be out for several days jamal crawford started for francis and finished with 25 points and 9 assists the knicks should get forwards jared jeffries and channing frye back this week , but they can ill afford to lose anyone else thomas has spoken often lately of finally having his best players available , to prove that his team can be playoffworthy if whole we 're in a race and we 're still very much in the race , and we 're still very much in the thick of things , thomas said before the game and our sanity is good , in terms of our team our mental health is good our physical health may not be good , but our mental health is good we 're in the race , and we intend to stay in it and run it we may not win the race with recordsetting time , and it may not be one of those races where everybody says , 'wow , they were great' but the goal is to win the race we 're not trying to break any records we got a steady course that we got to stay stubborn and focused about and when we get our players back , hopefully we 'll play better rebounds speaking in his role as team president , isiah thomas effectively ruled out pursuing allen iverson , the philadelphia 76ers' disgruntled guard no , i like our team , thomas said i like what we have i think we need to get healthy , and when we 're healthy and the way we 're playing , i'm not looking to make any changes i'm satisfied with where we are and what we have iverson has demanded a trade , and the 76ers have said they intend to accommodate him i watch television and i'm in the nba and i watch sports , so yeah , i'm following it , said thomas , who otherwise declined to comment on the matter i definitely do n't like talking about other teams' situations or players , because i do n't want anybody talking about ours forwards jared jeffries and channing frye are likely to return this week jeffries , recovering from a broken left wrist , is scheduled for a final evaluation tomorrow and could be cleared to play that night against the boston celtics frye , recovering from a sprained left ankle , was jogging and shooting before the game the ankle remains a little tender , but frye is on track to return by the end of the week with jeffries , frye , steve francis and kelvin cato \( foot \) out , the knicks had only 10 players available photo eddy curry surpassed 20 points for the ninth game in a row , the longest such streak for a knick since 1998 \( photo by andrew gombert for the new york times \) \( pg 3 \)
on oct 8 , 1918 , cpl alvin cullum york and 16 other american doughboys stumbled upon more than a dozen german soldiers having breakfast in a boggy hollow here the ensuing firefight ended with the surrender of 132 germans and won corporal york a promotion to sergeant , the medal of honor and a place in america s pantheon of war heroes now another battle is unfolding as rival researchers use global positioning systems and computer programs , old maps and military reports to try to establish the exact site of the fighting on that day 88 years ago their heated examinations do not challenge the essential heroism of sergeant york , yet such scrutiny helps explain why it is hard to be a hero these days there are other reasons , too , of course wars are often unpopular clashes fraught with moral ambiguity , and while the news media are often attracted to heroism , they also like to challenge myth building the military s attempt to turn pfc jessica lynch into a hero after the invasion of iraq unraveled when it emerged that she had not emptied her rifle at advancing iraqi soldiers , as first reported the initial accounts of cpl pat tillman s death in afghanistan in april 2004 came undone when it was disclosed that the corporal , a former nfl star , had been killed by members of his own unit military abuses now have a longer shelf life than acts of derringdo it was easier to create heroic stories in 1918 when the press was more pliable and the public more gullible , and the popular news media had a fondness for tales of uncomplicated bravery though newspaper articles at the time refer to members of sergeant york s platoon who challenged the accounts of that day , the doubters were given only enough attention to dismiss them his exploits grew until he had singlehandedly silenced 35 german machine gun nests and killed 25 enemy soldiers the latterday search for the site of his heroic stand raises questions about the longaccepted account in particular , evidence of the sprawl of german military positions that day does not mesh easily with the geographic concentration described in sergeant york s published diary according to his account , he was in a group of 17 men who sneaked behind enemy lines to attack german machine gunners who were holding up a larger american advance they surprised a group of soldiers , who surrendered , but almost immediately came under fire from machine gunners on a ridge 30 yards away six of the americans were killed and three others were wounded , leaving corporal york in charge he is credited with overcoming the superior force by using his sharpshooting skills , honed during turkey shoots and squirrel hunts in the tennessee woods every time i seed a german i jes teched him off , his published diary reads this version holds that the senior german officer in charge eventually offered to order his men to surrender if corporal york would stop shooting within weeks the young tennessean was being feted as a war hero , and by the time he returned to a new york city tickertape parade the next may , he had been anointed the great war s bravest patriot but even he seemed bemused by the mythmaking that surrounded him , and he shunned the lucrative limelight after the war for the obscurity of his old tennessee home his heroism might have been forgotten outside the state had hollywood not revived the story in the 1941 film sergeant york gary cooper won an oscar for his portrayal of the hero , and the film became the highestgrossing movie of the year as another european war was under way but underlying the wellshaped tale is a murkier , more complex narrative sergeant york s published diary is actually a heavily embellished account written for magazine serialization in the 1920 s with help from a flamboyant australian soldierpoet named tom skeyhill , who was blinded earlier in the war that diary contradicts itself on several points , and the homey , mountain vernacular in which it is written is almost certainly an invention of mr skeyhill , who often wrote in colorful dialects michael birdwell , a historian and the curator of sergenat york s papers at the alvin c york historic site , says the sergeant s family has never made the real diary available to historians , so it is not clear what it contains the question is , what is really york and what is afterthefact addition and what is plain fabrication \? said mr birdwell , who is part of a team searching for the exact location of the battle i personally dismiss much of the document nor did sergeant york s tale go unchallenged although the army took affidavits from the surviving platoon members corroborating his account , at least one of the men later asserted that he , too , had fired his weapon during the battle and that it was impossible to tell who was responsible for killing the most germans or how many of them had died two corporals , william cutting and bernard early , who were both wounded , said the sergeant york legend had started with a reporter for the saturday evening post , george patullo they met him at a firstaid station after the incident , they said , and told him about the day s events
to the sports editor the likable andy roddick continues to attract optimistic apologias but a candid assessment would acknowledge that roddick s ground strokes lack sizzle and precision he begins points predictably with an offforehand drive , followed by midcourt topspin shots , while he waits for an opening in his upset of roddick in the fourth round of the australian open , marcos baghdatis stepped into these balls repeatedly and hit winners roddick never found an answer he has none roddick s explosive serve is a sufficient weapon only on grass , and his movement is unremarkable but he is the american hope and is hardworking and charming even after many disappointing performances , the news media keep bolstering his status and softpedaling his deficiencies in contrast , the williams sisters are chided for their halfhearted preparation and loss of form footwork , conditioning , weight , attitude , service speed are all criticized perhaps wasted talent gets more careful attention than a limited talent sara hartley oakland , calif
since i have had the opportunity to see a few arab homes , and to observe and interact at some length with the populace here in falluja , i thought it might be interesting to point out a few of the similarities and differences between the life we know and that of an iraqi hundreds of customs and courtesies surround the arab culture upon my arrival here , i didn t know what to believe and what to shrug off as nonsense i quickly realized that most things i had learned from ustatha samir during culture time in arabic class held true in the real world it s always rather surreal to imagine life drastically different than american culture without actually experiencing it , but after seeing this small part of the arab world with my own eyes , i know i ll never forget it let s start with the arab home sandals will be strewn about in front of the door where their owners have left them for safe keeping closedtoe shoes are quite the anomaly here , even in the dusty environment of iraq it appears the locals feet are quite accustomed to this and have hardened accordingly next , there will probably be a coathanger in the foyer where dishdashas are hung dishdashas are the long buttonup robes worn by men , and are most often referred to as mandresses by marines it s difficult to explain , but the phrase mandress doesn t really contain a negative connotation it is simply a quick and easy way to describe a male s attire \( ie keep an eye on the mam in the white mandress \) that s an acronym we use mam \( militaryaged male \) it means any male from his late teens to his late 50 s insurgents are almost invariably mam s , which i m sure doesn t come as a surprise that s right , we profile based on age and gender and it works further inside the house you ll find a receiving room that is usually the most nicely furnished and welldecorated room of the house this room is used for entertaining and socializing with guests it appears common for iraqis to sleep in this room , although in my limited experience it appears sleeping may occur in almost any room except the kitchen i ll get back to the kitchen in a moment , but first i must tell you about sleeping arrangements no beds none everyone generally huddles into the same room and sleeps on brightly colored blankets spread directly onto the floor it appears the sleeping gear for one person consists of two blankets \( one to lie on , one to cover up with \) and a pillow some homes have large , brightly colored pads for the inhabitants to sleep on also , there doesn t appear to be an arabic equivalent of pajamas everyone seems to sleep in his or her clothes from the day the kitchen usually has one stove , which consists of a large lattice grill over a propane burner sacks with grains of all types will be stacked in a remote corner amid racks of plates and glassware there is also a refrigerator that will chill the day s leftovers i don t believe ziploc bags are a part of the equation there will invariably be a stack of mujbread in some part of the kitchen next , the stories i heard about the use of the left hand appear to be true it is considered unclean i don t have any direct knowledge of it s duties in the restroom , but i know you never see anyone signaling , waving , or pointing with it we are taught to return the favor and not wave or signal iraqis with our left hands it is also common to see two people of the same gender holding hands this appears to merely be a sign of friendship or camaraderie i once observed three children walking along a road i can only assume they were going to school , because it was early morning and they were carrying books the two boys were holding hands as the little girl followed behind lastly tea and tobacco both are extremely prevalent in arab society elaborate metal tea pots etched with ornate patterns adorn the receiving room of many households i am not sure exactly how the tea is brewed , but i know that when served the tea leaves sit directly in your cup with no straining the cup of homebrewed tea of which i partook was delicious it was just the right blend of really sweet and really strong that i learned to expect of tea during my southern upbringing smoking doesn t happen quite as majestically , but it happens every bit as often it also doesn t really appear to be a personal decision here it actually seems as if everyone smokes almost every male keeps a pack of cigarettes on his person , usually in the breast pocket of his dishdasha i am not sure where females keep them , but i have seen them quietly smoking indoors , out of the public eye i don t consider myself an expert on arab culture by any stretch of the imagination as a matter of fact , i wouldn t consider myself very learned on the subject at all however , what was once only a fascinating topic of discussion , i have now seen with my own eyes , and that itself appears to put me a head and shoulders above the experience of the average american

are you sure , mark \? that is bizarre the pet shop boys had a song modeled on the soviet national anthem \? why go west by the pet shop boys but not go west by the village people \? the germans have made some strange and ambiguous choices in organizing this tournament , that s for sure well , that s it from here , and in case any of you are wondering , this particular playbyplay booth overlooks the no 1 train in west harlem shevchenko was awesome today for ukraine , and chelsea fans have to be licking their chops at the prospect of joining their club in august but kalinichenko , to me , was the best , and his performance today was one of the very best of the tournament check back in to the times blog for spaintunisia the 32nd match of germany 2006 described for you by duncan irving till next time , cheers ! 90 3 another dangerous shot from ukraine is just deflected over the crossbar by a defender , and at last the whistle blows game over ! redemption for the zbirna ! ukraine 4 , saudi arabia 0 90 1 one last thrust by saudi arabia twice their men go down in the box and appeal for penalty , but none given and indeed , that second foul looked like a real one to me but nothing for the arabians 90 kalinichenko gets himself open in the middle of the box 17 yards away , but he shoots just over the bar shep messing on espn 2 scolds him for not passing , but i completely disagree that shot was ripe for the taking , and besides , kalinichenko created , what \? two of the four goals and scored the fourth himself , no \? 89 yellow sviderskiy booked for cutting down his man maybe blokhin should take off kalinichenko , who s carrying a yellow wouldn t want him to miss a game 86 sub now shevchenko comes off for milevskiy and when he reaches the bench , the crowd chants for shevchenko to take a curtain call , baseballstyle ! 84 goal goal goal goal ukraine ukraine ukraine ukraine ! shvechenko breaks free on the left side , runs 45 yards , gets into the box , then pushes across the box to kalinichenko , who , wide open , roofs it ! great play ! ukraine 4 , saudi 0 well , kalinichenko was serving everything up for everyone else , and now shevchenko retruns the favor and gives kalinichenko a goal perfectly done ! shevchenko drew two defenders and the keeper to him when he sprinted into the box , and the goal was easy as pierogi 79 sub voronin out , andriy gusin in a fine game from voronin today 77 kalinichenko given a yellow for clotheslining his man in the ukraine end now a sub for the saudis al jaber finally in , for noor the desert team definitely need to score for goaldifference purposes 73 yellow kariri booked and now kalinichenko takes a screwballing shot that zaid must dive to catch 71 yet again zaid has to go down to grab a loose ball in the box the zbirna are putting on one of the most impressive performances of the tournament and now rebrov comes off , applauding the crowd he had that amazing longrange goal subbed out for ruslan rotan 66 great play by zaid ! with voronin coming into the box and going up for a high ball with tukar , zaid comes out and punches away he socks voronin in the jaw , then falls kettle over teacup , or whatever the expression is he s down flat now , being attended to and how served up that dangerous ball \? kalinichenko 65 i mentioned spartak moscow before back in soviet times , spartak was the trade unionsponsored team , the club of the people , some of whose directors were persecuted in the stalin era dinamo , of course , were sponsored by the interior ministry , whose national police force and kgb made them pretty despised among many fans cska , the central army club , had a certain following too they were favored by the authorities in hockey and made the core of the national team , and thus they were not all that popular , but in soccer they were quite modest and received no favors from the government all that s finished now , of course cska has a sponsorship deal with roman abramovich and are moving up into the ranks of european football , and the other russian clubs are getting richer too but back in the soviet days , the ussr s biggest and most accomplished club was dinamo kyiv and now kalinichenko takes a shot that just skips off the bar a big smile from the spartak moscow man as he jogs back into position ! 57 a wellreffed match , this one , in contrast to some of the others fans who watch the premier league a lot konw that the refs there are very good indeed 56 yellow for simulation to saudi s al ghambi ! mr poll saw what the replay showed clearly , that he fell down in the ukrainian box trying to win a corner 55 sub for the saudis , dokhi out at defense , khathran in and in the midfield , ameen comes out and the forward al hawsawi comes in 52 kalinichenko , the spartak moscow man , serves again ! it s knocked away , but shevchenko retrieves it goes to gusev , who takes a shot , blocked , and then he fires the rebound wide saudi arabia aren t playing badly well , maybe their defense is but it s just that ukraine are so good what a turnaround ! they lost 04 , and now they re winning 30 they could well be on even terms in goal difference by the time of their third match 49 kalinichenko another brilliant free kick ! right into the crowd again , and it pinballs away but every single one of his free kicks has been deadly accurate everyone s going to be talking about shevchenko when this one is over , but i think kalinichenko s the man of the match his free kicks are as fantastic as beckhams , but unlike becks , he never mishits it 47 shevchenko gave his defender al montashari a tiny push the espn2 commentators are making a lot of it , but it was only the slightest little onehanded shove 46 goal goal goal ukraine ! just after the restart , 45 seconds in , kalinichenko crosses into the box , and shevchenko heads home the combination that s been so deadly all day more halftime univision s picture went out for a couple of seconds just now , reminding me of the recurring nightmare i ve had the last couple of weeks that i ve forgotten to pay my cable bill and the cable company cuts me off in the middle of a game but the picture s back on , just in time for that beer commercial about the great no 10 s of soccer , in this case cuahtemoc blanco , roberto baggio , carlos valderrama and luis garcia they use a shot of the actual blanco , which make sense , cuz he s still playing but they ve also got a current valderrama , and he looks as fit as he did when he played he must be in his early 40 s by now for baggio and garcia they use doubles almost ready to restart they show a closeup of the ball , and it is quite wet the espn2 announcers have been talking a lot about the wet field , but they haven t been saying that it s actually raining hard to see it on the screen since most of the stadium is covered by a roof , but now we see that it is definitely coming down halftime excellent comments in this first half thanks , people i guess i didn t see ukraine s firstever match , but rather their firstever road match thanks , jersey guy yes , mike , the 31st match , not no 32 rv , a nutmeg is when you play the ball through someone legs , and it s even worse when you retrieve the ball on the other side noor did that to a defender earlier ahmad , thanks for telling us about the midfielder al shalhoub going home because his mother passed away and john writes in to our email address to ask what that song is they play in the stadiums at the end of every game i don t know , john , but every time i hear it , it reminds me of the old soviet national anthem , a tune all hockey fans of a certain age are familiar with i swear the first two or three bars are exactly the same if anyone knows what this song is , give us a shout eh \? 45 1 shame on me i m using the russian word rather than the ukrainian one the zbirna ! my bad , ukrainianspeakers ! the zbirna have been awesome this first half and now the whistle blows they go to their dressing rooms the zbirna 2 , saudi arabia 0 ! 45 two on one for ukraine and shevchenko s shot is blocked the sbornaya have all kinds of room every time they get to the saudi midfield ! two minutes added 44 shevchenko slips it just wide of the post ! he was open in the box , but shot wide and blokhin , the old soviet striker , is quite upset that shevchenko missed that one 41 yellow coming up to dokhi for tripping nesmachnyi they re both flat on the ground and mr poll must wait for dokhi to end his theatrics before issuing the card 40 the sbornaya are playing smoothly , confidently and creatively what a contrast from their first outing , against spain ! they were the victims of some unlucky bounces in that one , it s true , but still they got whomped , 40 what a recovery in this first half , though they fully deserve to be up by two goals 36 goal goal goal goal goal goal ukraine ! a 35yard bullet strike from rebrov to the far corner ! ukraine 2 , saudi 0 that shot was deadly poison ! zaid tried to leap to get to it , but he slipped on the wet field even if he d gotten off cleanly , i don t think he would ve reached that ball it was going so fast ! rebrov , with perhaps the longest strike of this tournament ! 35 ukraine buzzing around the right side just outside the box they can t get a shot through , but voronin , rebrov and co are looking dangerous 31 now espn2 has weighed in on the temperature they say 82 25 is the temp 29 dokhi beats two men and shoots from far out , but it s high i have a correction to make this is indeed match no 32 of the tournament , but no 31 is taking place later today , spain vs tunisia so this is really the 31st match , not quite the halfway point i m not quite as mistyeyed then but for some reason some of the matches were numbered out of chronological sequence by the organizers whatever 27 voronin shoots just wide from 25 yards it comes at the end of a nice movement from left to center 24 almost an autogol ! noor nutmegs his man on the flank and dumps into the ukraine box , but rusol rather than clearing it deflects it , and it zips just wide of the post ! the resulting corner gets kicked just wide of the other post by a leaping al mantasari 22 yellow to defender nesmachnyi for scything down noor with a twofooted tackle from the side a yellow is deserved , but it was all that much different from the tackle that got the amerks pablo mastroeni sent off against italy 21 shevchenko left open 25 yards away , he takes his time and shoots it , but right at zaid ukraine imposing their stamp on this match ! 20 kalinichenko in his lovely blond tresses is the man of the match so far every single corner he has taken has been lethal , and his passes during the run of play are ingenious and incisive 18 kalinichenko a great pass to set up shevchenko wide open right in front of goal ! but he s wrongfooted by it somehow how did shevchenko miss it \? the whole play started when a pass hit the referee and pinballed right to kalinichenko 14 it was dokhi who stopped shevchenko s header and another long ball goes just a yard too far for shevchenko in the saudi box zaid catches it the stadium is buzzing ! they re doing the mexican wave ! 13 kalinichenko another corner danger ! it bounces off a defender and out over the line another corner that pings around dangerously and goes out another corner stopped on the line ! shevchenko headed a bullet , and a defender stopped it on the line didn t see who it was , but he saved a goal ! 11 rebrov picks off a pass on the right and sends it into the box , where zaid catches it then noor at the other end dumps it into the box , and it s only just cleared by the defense now back the other way shevchenko dispossessed at the edge of the saudi box now back again ! 9 endtoend action ! the ball in the saudi arabia end , and just as soon as it s booted out it hangs out deep in the ukrainian end 6 noor sends one into the box for the saudis , and it bounces around dangeoursly before being cleared going back to the ukrainian goal , the whole series of corners started when zaid had trouble with a ball at his feet and had to concede the first corner kalinichenko it was who took the corners 5 the saudis come close to equalizing down the other end , but the ball is shot over so this game has started like so many others , with an early goal dictating the story line 3rd minute a ukraine corner is sent into the mixer and headed just over the bar ! another goal kick goooalllll goal goal goal goal goal ! rusol ! the corner was sent right into the mixer again , and rusol came leaping in and played it off his shin no chance for zaid in goal on that one ukraine 1 , saudi arabia 0  and now the anthems the saudi hymn is sung by all the players , who stand arms draped over shoulders a big cheer from the saudi fans , who all seem to be swathed in green now the ukrainian anthem the players seem sullen , but the ukrainians in the stands are singing in heartfelt fashion they re all in blue and yellow , waving their flags and now at the end , the players turn and applaud their supporters it s 90 degrees in hamburg , 32 centigrade , according to univision , but fifa gives the temperature at 70 21 in any case , it s cloudy as evening falls , and the stadium is pretty much covered by a roof anyway the referee is graham poll of england the saudis will kick off the sons of the desert ! shevchenko makes ready on the other side he croses himself the whistle blows it s on !  four changes in the ukraine lineup from last time out , and that makes sense for the saudis , only one change ameen starting for al temyat in the midfield the teams are ready to enter the field ! ukraine , whose players seem quite grim in the tunnel , are in all yellow saudi arabia are in all white  welcome back to the new york times s live coverage of the world cup this is the 32nd match of this 64match tournament , and i have to admit i m a little verklempt the party s halfover but no , i mustn t look at it that way the party s only gaining momentum , hurtling toward its unspeakable climax ! yes , that s much better ! and even if this game may well be the least glamorous matchup of germany 2006 , there s always the chance that it could end up a cracker for one thing , there s the presence of andriy shevchenko up front for the ukrainians , and presumably he will will be eager to lead his team back to respectability after their 40 loss to spain for saudi arabia , the glamour boy is sami aljaber , he of the 168 caps and the beautiful late goal that briefly gave the saudis the lead in their exciting 22 encounter with tunisia he s usually brought in as a sub to inject speed when the opposition defense is getting tired there s much at stake here if ukraine lose , they re out of it , and if saudi arabia lose , they re in deep trouble a draw wouldn t help either team very much , but obviously the saudis would benefit more than the ukrainians a personal trivia factoid i attended what i believe was the first game ukraine ever played it was against the united states at piscataway , nj , back in 1992 , i think it was i don t remember much from it except that it was quite dull , but there were a lot of proud ukrainians there in blue and yellow , happy to celebrate their country s independence am i right , ukrainskis \?

a pandemonium of shoes , sandals , sneakers and highheeled boots overflowed the cubbies at the top of the stairs while their owners , about 400 barefoot women , scrambled for space on the floor as the morning service began at masjid darul qu'ran , long island s largest mosque some 800 men filled the main hall on the level below , and another 200 people arrived during opening prayers the occasion was eid uladha , one of the two official holidays in the islamic calendar , which fell on jan 10 \( the other is eid ulfitr , marking the end of ramadan , a month of fasting and prayer it falls on oct 22 this year both holidays migrate through the secular calendar following the muslim lunar calendar , which , unlike the jewish calendar , has no provision to stay in synch with the seasons \) eid uladha commemorates a pivotal event shared by islam , judaism and christianity god s command to abraham to sacrifice his son to prove his faith and obedience , and abraham s willingness to obey according to both the book of genesis and the koran , a heartbroken abraham was preparing the altar for the sacrifice when a reprieve came from god having passed the test , he was told to spare his son and sacrifice a ram instead the two books differ on some points , most notably which of abraham s two sons was to be sacrificed genesis says it was isaac , through whom jews trace their people s descent from the patriarch abraham the koran names ishmael , through whom arabs trace their descent either way , the spiritual lesson of the episode is fundamental to both traditions the important thing is the agreement about accepting the test of god , said mustapha senghor , a trustee of the bay shore mosque , after the service abraham s act of purification is celebrated today muslims are instructed by the koran to follow abraham s example on eid uladha heads of households must sacrifice an animal , usually a sheep or a goat , and donate onethird of the meat to the needy and onethird to neighbors the rest can be used by the family to celebrate the day that is not easy to do on long island keeping farm animals is illegal in most suburban neighborhoods , to say nothing of ritually slaughtering them that leaves the island s muslims with two basic alternatives to make a charitable donation in lieu of the sacrifice , or to pay a halal butcher to slaughter an animal for them , perhaps with members of the family on hand to take part in the ritual \( those who can afford neither option are permitted to fast instead \) there is some debate among muslims about which approach is better , especially since the nearest butchers able to handle the sacrifices for long island families are in new jersey and pennsylvania there is none on the island but there is general agreement that the tradition of sacrifice , unchanged since the time of the prophet muhammad , must not be neglected eid uladha marks the end of the weeklong period of pilgrimage , or hajj , one of the five pillars of islam each year , muslims making the pilgrimage to mecca retrace abraham s path to the place where tradition says he built his altar hundreds of millions of people every year salute the sacrifices of abraham , hagar and ishmael , said imam haq kauser of the bait ulhuda mosque in amityville this is the reward that god gave them , that their sacrifice never went to waste \( hagar was ishmael s mother isaac s mother was sarah \) most of the muslims interviewed for this article endorsed the practice of honoring eid uladha with a donation , but some said that only performing or attending an actual ritual sacrifice would do whatever is in the koran is not subject to modification or upgrades , said dr faroque khan , chairman of the board of trustees of the islamic center of long island in westbury you have to do things in a particular way and a particular manner part of it is the slaughter and commemorative ritual it is part of my faith it is commanded dr khan said he remembered eid uladha from his boyhood in kashmir as a special time where children received small gifts , new clothes and a little money as for the ritual sacrifice , at home we would do that in our backyard , he said but in jericho , where he lives now , he said i am not going to bring two sheep and slaughter them on my front lawn that would be breaking the law in the past , dr khan and members of his congregation often had a halal butcher perform the sacrifice and then distributed the meat to the needy on long island this year , he arranged with relatives in kashmir to have animals sacrificed there and delivered to an orphanage many say the outcome matters more than being present when the ritual is performed it s not very important to go now , mr kauser said to give the meat to the poor and needy , that is the reason it has nothing to do with the actual sacrifice even in mecca during the hajj , he said , there are companies that will take care of sacrifices on a pilgrim s behalf imam ahmed yacuturk of dix hills has performed the sacrifice himself in his native country , turkey the animal must be in perfect condition , so we look for it to be beautiful the bigger , the better , he said we say 'o god , you have given me the power to overpower this animal with your permission , with your name it could have been the other way around' he added when you do it for allah , you cleanse your soul you remember your sins prayers of thanksgiving are offered for the water , the soil , the air and the animal , which is fed and given water just before its slaughter with a sharp knife we cut with the least pain possible , mr yacuturk said although making a donation is certainly a good thing to do , mr yacuturk said , the experience of performing the ritual has its own irreplaceable quality it is better to do it yourself , he said god has ordered us to do this you realize this animal has given his life for you it brings you closer to god mr yacuturk , who resides and officiates at the united american muslim association mosque in dix hills , now prefers to arrange for a sacrifice in turkey rather than locally , because there is much greater poverty there we do n't need the meat here , he said here , it is not about , shall i eat meat today \? ' it s about , 'what kind of meat shall i eat today \? ' in addition to the sacrifice , eid uladha calls upon muslims to reflect on its spiritual meaning you sacrifice yourself trying to live according to the koran , mr yacuturk said holding your hand from stealing , holding your mouth from lying your personal sacrifice is trying to be a better person , a better muslim , a better neighbor for mr kauser , he said the best lesson in this is to be obedient to the parent ishmael was so obedient that he agreed upon this great sacrifice he knew that god commanded him rizwan alladin , president of the bait ulhuda mosque in amityville , said we are all going to be called upon to make some huge sacrifice to prove our obedience and love to god it does n't mean suicide bombing maybe times are going to get rough for us , and we will have to sacrifice the way we live in order to help others survive that s what abraham did photo muslims gathered at masjid darul qu'ran for eid uladha in january to celebrate the day , households sacrifice an animal , usually a goat or a sheep but keeping farm animals is illegal in most suburban neighborhoods , leaving muslims to seek alternative rituals \( photo by phil marino for the new york times \)

green apple is what wine experts often taste in a good chardonnay it is also a flavor that can bring out the best in a dry riesling , especially one that may not offer the rich complexity characteristic of the grape in germany about a year ago , to complement an array of austrian rieslings , i added diced green apple to the broth for mussels steamed in wine i turned to green apple again recently for a dish to go with rieslings , australian this time , not austrian i felt that the grassy , tartsweet fruit would elicit more balance from these somewhat onedimensional wines here , the apple is put to subtler use , as a component in a stuffing for roasted poussins celery and sage ramped up the herbal qualities , while pancetta , which has a delicious affinity for sage , contributed a satisfying meatiness to enhance the lean birds i used stalks of celery to line the roasting pan , creating a kind of rack to support the birds and keep them from sticking the juices of the cooked celery then added flavor to the simple pan sauce that moistened the poussins none of these elements overwhelmed the australian rieslings and the acidity and hints of tropical fruit in the best of them made them appealing enough to savor throughout dinner each poussin will provide a generous serving , ample for those with good appetites , further whetted by the wine considering the addition of the stuffing , some people may want to eat only a half , which is why i split the poussins before arranging them on a big platter , instead of putting whole poussins on individual plates splitting them also makes them easier for guests to manage add a bowl of buttered fresh green beans and another of potatoes , either roasted or mashed , and you have the makings of an oldfashioned sunday dinner it is one that could be shared by friends or family any night of the week , with a wine that is easy to drink poussins with apple stuffing time 2 hours 3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil 1 1 2 ounces pancetta , diced 2 3 cup chopped shallots 1 3 cup chopped celery 3 4 cup panko 2 1 2 cups chicken stock 1 granny smith apple , peeled and diced 6 sage leaves , minced salt and ground black pepper 6 poussins 8 celery stalks 1 heat 2 tablespoons oil in a skillet , add pancetta and cook over medium heat until pancetta starts to color add shallots and celery and saut \? ntil soft add panko , increase heat , and cook , stirring , until panko is golden add 1 2 cup stock remove from heat , stir in apple and sage and season with salt and pepper 2 preheat oven to 425 degrees dry poussins inside and out stuff each with panko mixture and tie legs together to enclose stuffing rub birds with remaining olive oil and season with salt and pepper 3 arrange celery stalks crosswise in a roasting pan large enough to hold poussins place poussins in pan on celery add 1 cup remaining stock to pan place in oven and roast 1 hour 15 minutes remove poussins from pan and remove trussing 4 use back of a fork to press any juices from celery stalks , then remove celery from pan and discard add remaining cup stock , place pan over medium heat and stir to loosen particles in pan bring to a simmer strain sauce into a bowl and season with salt and pepper 5 use a large , sharp knife to halve each poussin lengthwise arrange on a platter and serve with sauce alongside yield 6 to 8 servings

linebacker barrett green and offensive lineman jason whittle were starters for the giants two seasons ago , but neither started a game in 2005 suddenly expendable , they find themselves out of work , at least until the nfl s freeagent signing period begins friday in preparing for the start of the shopping season , and to create a bit more room under the league s salary cap , the giants released green and whittle yesterday they also announced the retirement of the starting free safety brent alexander , which may create the bigger hole in the roster green , expected to compete for the starting weakside linebacker spot , ended each of his two seasons with the giants on injured reserve a knee injury ended his 2004 season after 10 games unable to recover fully in 2005 , green played just one game , on special teams , before being placed on injured reserve again drafted in the second round by the detroit lions in 2000 , green was scheduled to make 2475 million in base salary this season , a 1 million raise from last season whittle , who signed with the giants as an undrafted free agent out of missouri state in 1998 , was a reserve center and guard in his first few seasons before becoming a starter in 2002 he then spent one season with the tampa bay buccaneers before returning to the giants in a trade in 2004 after several linemen were injured he started all 16 games that season , but started none in 2005 , as the giants settled on an interior of left guard david diehl , center shaun o'hara and right guard chris snee whittle was scheduled to make 15 million in base salary this season after earning 950 , 000 in 2005 the giants , who were already under the salary cap , cleared more than 3 million from the cap with the three roster moves but they now need to find a replacement for the 34yearold alexander , who never missed a game in his 12year career undrafted out of tennessee state , he played four seasons with the arizona cardinals , two with the carolina panthers and four with the pittsburgh steelers before signing with the giants in 2004 more steady than spectacular , he started 178 of 192 career games , including all 32 with the giants last season , alexander had four interceptions he had three or four in each of his final six seasons and made 61 tackles earlier this month , rich seubert , a backup lineman , was given a contract extension
american history is short on 300th birthdays which is only one reason to salute ben franklin , who had the foresight to have been born three centuries ago today it was one of many generous acts for his country he makes us feel we have a history as a man of science , franklin lamented that he had been born too soon \( a beautiful woman 40 years his junior generally elicited the same regret \) but he could not truly quibble with chronology in america s seminal story , birth order was on his side he was already a father and a thriving publisher when adams and washington were in swaddling clothes he retired from the printing business when jefferson was 4 he had flown his kite when madison was an infant by the time hamilton was born he had turned to politics , and proposed a first plan for colonial union he could have been either man s grandfather franklin was , too , the founder who came the furthest he alone spent six decades as a british subject before embracing the revolutionary cause , to which he applied the zeal of a convert he neither hailed from an elite nor subscribed to one the youngest son of a youngest son , he chafed as much against entitled elder siblings as against enthroned upper classes until tom sawyer displaced him , he ranked as our foremost juvenile delinquent franklin s autobiography begins with defying his family and running away from home perhaps i was too saucy and provoking , he reflected afterward , with ample reason he thought he was writing his own story but was of course writing america s as well neither birth order nor longevity he signed every document central to america s founding would alone have established franklin as the uramerican , however he was a true egalitarian , which could not be said of adams for all his ingenuity he was less a manufacturer of ideas than a purveyor of them he was no dreamy jefferson alexander hamilton may well have known everything , but franklin questioned everything his curiosity was matched by the suppleness of his mind , one singularly free of hobgoblins \( his ability to argue either side of an issue with equal vigor drove adams to distraction \) nor was there anything orthodox or evangelical about franklin , who took his puritanism as he took his enlightenment ideals with a splash of water , hold the doctrine his religion was tolerance , his sect pragmatism when did he become so plushly , so comfortably , so voluptuously american \? as the features are not aquiline , so the morals are far from impeccable with equal genius franklin codified good behavior and defied it he was an organization man who was not particularly organized , a committee man who worked most effectively through back channels with equal gusto he preached temperance and wrote drinking songs he practiced frugality only , he admitted , so long as it was absolutely necessary diligence was his middle name , but few have made dilatoriness sound so attractive a great deal of his famed industry consisted of getting someone else to whitewash the fence that franklin would one day be anointed the first great american was far from clear during his lifetime he was proud of his social sprint , which he merrily advertised to his mind it made the success all the sweeter he who had been born to poverty and obscurity had dined with royalty ! but social mobility was not something one bragged about in the l8th century it was franklin who gave work and bootstraps among other things a good name one easily forgets that democrat , too , was a dirty word in colonial america born too soon on those counts , franklin died too soon as well the united states senate chose not to mourn him his official eulogy fell to his avowed enemy , the reverend william smith and the 19th century was not kind to franklin tangled up with his fictional alter ego , the almanacwriting poor richard , he was too practical , too rational , too stubbornly middle class keats sniffed at his mean and thrifty maxims emerson had little use for him thoreau , melville , poe had none there was something shabby , shambling , shallow about the likeable lowlife , king of rotarians no poet has ever sung franklin s praises on his 200th birthday this newspaper extended tepid good wishes he seems to have been quite without definite ambition , his attitude toward life was mildly cynical , and by inclination he was a manager rather than a leader of men it did not help that franklin stood as the only founder who made an art of levity where it is unclear if james madison even had a personality , franklin is all pluck and charm irony was his natural idiom he is to jefferson or washington as moli \? is to corneille , winking farce and earthy intrigue versus piety and nobility , the satirical versus the sententious by his own admission franklin was a rascal , one well pleased with his cunning , the more so when the result of his machinations happened to be the founding of a hospital he was equal parts franklin delano roosevelt , ronald reagan and bugs bunny

roque santa cruz has done absolutley nothing today paredes , on the other hand , has worked hard and been about as effective as any guarani player 77 a deep ball to crouch , who heds it to his left but because england are now playing with a lone striker , the ball goes uselessly to one of the three paraguay defenders playing back 75 england retreating into their customary shell to protect their 10 lead how many times have we seen this \? and how come england don t get tarred with the reputation of uninspired , defensive play as italy does \? they re lucky today that paraguay have asbolutely nothing on the ball 73 beckham to downing to lampard , right to left to center , all one touches , and lampard s shot from 20 yards forces a leaping save by bobadilla to tip it over the bar great play ! 70 youth soccer error by ashley cole ! he lifted his foot making the throw in ball to paraguay 68 substitution for paraguay , midfielder bonet out for forward nelson cuevas and cuevas hops around deftly on his first touch , spinning with skill at the outside of the england box 67 another foul called on crouch , the sixth called against him he dived to tackle a loose ball , won it cleanly , but when paredes fell over him , the mexican ref whistled against crouch unfair , i think 65 valdez races down the right and gets off a good shot , but right at robinson 64 yellow crouch given a card for dissent ! he s been called for fouls all day , yet he s been knocked around pretty good without getting any sympathy from the ref he gets called for a foul again , complains about it as he has all day , and gets booked for dissent 62 downing gets his first touch of the game he s wide open on the left and runs 40 yards with the ball before it s tackled out nice first touch ! 60 bonet for paraguay shoots from the right side , robinson bats it away , but paredes gets the rebound in the air and hits it over the goal as he and robinson collide a half chance for paraguay , that was 59 joe cole drives a shot from the top of the box that bobadilla dives to gather is this game starting to pick up \? 58 caceres arrives just in time to touch the ball away from peter crouch in the box 56 substitution for england forward owen out , midfielder stewart downing in 54 rob from tribeca has sent in his observation that the giant rooflike thing is casting a shadow reminiscent of a huge space alien right in the middle of the field i have to say that the level of discourse is rising to the occasion to make up for the dullness of this match 49 fowzie has written in from derbyshire in the uk to say he hopes 17yearold theo walcott gets a chance today for england hey , anything to make this more interesting he also observes that they ve got nothing going on through the midfield true dat the big thing with this england team was the skill of gerrard and lampard and how they could play the ball skillfully through the middle , but we ve seen none of that today 46 back under way let s see if the second half is any better even the crowd at frankfurt is subdued , so dull has this game become julie foudy , at halftime on abc , has a smart observation england fans will be fretting that owen isn t involved enough , and that crouch hasn t done enough during the run of play she s right beckham has been by far the best player on the field , but other england players have done very little that you could term a threat 45 4 07 halftime ! thank heavens this game has really devolved i blame england for not pressing their advantage paraguay lucky to get to the dressing room down only 10 , but we are unlucky to be witnessing such a wan match 45 3 ashley cole falls down along the sideline and a paraugay chance develops valdez chests it down to paredes in the england box , and his shot on the half volley goes just wide paraguay s first decent sequence of the game but it happened only because ashley cole fell down 45 this game has become dull england have dominated , but ever since the first 15 minutes or so , they haven t had any real chances , flubbing just about every opportunity they ve created and paraguay haven t done anything at all four minutes of stoppage time oy 43 beckham shoots from the top of the area about 22 yards away bobadilla dives , but it bends a bit wide 38 chilavert on paraguay s inability to get the ball near the england keeper robinson is practically a spectator 36 england all over paraguay ! joe cole pulls off several stepovers at the left edge of the box and leaves his defender in the dust his cross goes too far , but beckham picks it up on the other side and serves up another crouch falls and submarines a guarani defender , and it s cleared out but england are utterly dominant 31 joe cole running wild in the midfield he starts a second great play by running through everyone , though it ends harmlessly with a poor shot by gerrard but cole is looking very dangerous 30 crouch wins a corner with his footwork ! he outsmarts two defenders near the touchline who says the guy s robotic \? 26 gerrard leaps to knock a ball away , and his knee collides with paredes s head but it s gerrard who s hurt he gets up , though , and plays on 24 there s a halfroof on the stadium , and the shadow it and its support cables are making on the field is extremely annoying half the field is in shadow , half in bright sunlight , but in random places all over 23 lampard takes a great shot from the edge of the area off a give and go , and bobadilla leaps well to save it 22 now beckham spilled near the sideline by a sliding challenge from valdez , who gets a deserved yellow  19 another shot for paraguay , by riveros , that robinson has to dive to catch as riveros took it , gerrard slid out to block the shot and took riveros s feet out a yellow card for gerrard from the mexican ref , perhaps a bit harsh 18 first shot for paraguay , well wide , or as the univision announcer says , muy , muy impreciso 15 a quarter hour in , and paraguay have not had the ball in the england end they have looked extremely tight , right from the national anthem 12 beckham shoots it way wide didn t catch what the foul was , but it s possible that bobadilla handled the ball outside the box on his punt 12 free kick at the edge of the box for england ! six in the wall for paraguay 10 another england corner paraguay have dificulty clearing , and gerrard shoots from outside the box on the volley , a screaming drive , but it goes 10 feet over the bar 8 and immediately bobadilla gets involved he tries to keep the ball from bouncing over the end line , dives for it and misses the resulting corner is cleared 7 the keeper villar , who came out of his area right after the goal to clear away a loose ball with a sliding tackle , is down on the ground holding his calf and now he s being acocmpanied off by the trainer he has to leave the game ! so a substitution aldo bobadilla into the paraguay nets 3 goooooaaaalllll england ! beckham with a free kick from about 30 yards away , a dangerous bending ball into the box , and they all leaped for it , and the defender gamarra tipped it on the header past villar and into the net england 1 , paraguay 0 2nd minute correction the englishlanguage tv coverage is on abc and the announcer , whoever it is , is saying paragway ok , i ll stop nitpicking the paraguayan anthem now , and none of the players are singing , in contrast to the england players who sang their anthem , but the guarani players look very serious plenty of paraguay fans in the stands , and they re singing and clapping along to it lustily now the handshake line , and we re about to start gerrard for england and santa cruz for paraguay were the main fitness concerns , but they re both here in the starting lineups paraguay to kick off and it s on !  i ll be switching back and forth between univision and espn an interesting note , pointed out yesterday by a reader of this blog the color commentator on univision is none other than jose luis chilavert , the former paraguay goalkeeping great his slant on the game should be interesting , provided my extremely dodgy spanish is up to the task maybe fluent spanishspeakers can email in with examples of notable things he says \?

paul krugman responds to readers comments on his nov 3 column ,  leslie kappes , pompton lakes , nj i m not given to conspiracy theories , but it seems to me that bush was exactly and knowingly right when he unfurled the mission accomplished banner so many thousands of lives ago i believe the mission was from its inception no more or less than to provide halliburton , bechtel , and one or two chosen others with the largest boondoggle in history what better way to hand over billions of dollars to these corporations riddled as they are with administration officials , and to hand the money over with utter impunity \? what is more profitable for these corporations than to rebuild the infrastructure of an entire country devastated by war roads , pipelines , power stations , hospitals , not to mention an impregnable frontier fortress the new us embassy \? the mission was accomplished the minute the contracts were signed everything that has come after hundreds of thousands of iraqis dead , displaced , and in constant danger means nothing to the profiteers acceleration of a new nuclear arms race means nothing belittling the united states in the eyes of the world means nothing not forgetting that the rest of the world has witnessed for more than century our systematic crushing of democracy wherever it s raised its standard the utter failure of these corporations to achieve what they contracted for means nothing to them the money s in mission accomplished ! to say that profiteering is part of the human condition is no excuse to avoid the issue now the profiteers must be held accountable , but much more importantly , make reparations to the iraqi people , to the american taxpayer , and to the soldiers and their families who have been so callously thrown into the meat grinder to feed these most despicable of criminals the cynic will say , it ll never happen , and he s probably right but the task is not impossible and the initial steps should be the first order of business of our new congress thanks for listening paul krugman no , even i am not that cynical or at least i m cynical in a different way i think they really believed it would be a splendid little war , a few weeks of great tv followed by a victory parade mark donnithorne , alexandria , va i enjoyed reading your column today , but disagree with one minor comment why would the administration or congress ask us voters for more money when they really didn t ask for any money to begin with \? that would imply that tax cuts were rolled back or taxes were raised to pay for the war and reconstruction efforts ! deficit spending doesn t require any difficult decisions by an administration or congress just one of my personal frustrations as a military member who can t decide whether he s a libertarian or a liberal ! paul krugman i know none of this is actually paid for still , the initial 87 billion was a shock to the public , and they ve never asked for another significant slug of reconstruction money peter millman , storrs , conn i would sum up the sentiment in your column today this way kerry botched a joke bush botched a war so who should be apologizing \? paul krugman yep and tv news was walltowall kerry for three days robert paul dean , atlanta indeed , why are we still there \? what are we fighting for \? the only question i have about the reconstruction effort in iraq is this is the waste attributable primarily to avarice or to incompetence \? paul krugman incompetence on the part of government officials avarice on the part of the contractors ravi aron , santa monica , calif this is the sort of corruption that i would expect to see in the third world country in which i grew up it is difficult to believe that this could happen in the us i hope that the democrats do issue subpoenas and investigate corruption of this staggering scale what i fear is that they will instead block trade deals and raise protectionist barriers they sound more and more like sherrod brown and less and less like president clinton
it s official the knicks have taken the fun out of dysfunctional not only have they lost 10 straight games , but they have done so in a manner that often seems careless and lethargic their coach , larry brown , has repeatedly talked in the past week about how bad he feels about the situation and how he wants to see more determined play from the knicks malik rose , one of the team s more eloquent veterans , said the players were tired of fingerpointing , by brown and by teammates but that all seemed somewhat irrelevant after a 10072 loss to dallas on monday night the knicks did not seem to have enough energy to point a finger , let alone win a game against a tough opponent the knicks will have a reprieve from the schedule wednesday s home game against toronto is followed by the allstar game break , which extends through the weekend at the moment , the knicks \( 1437 \) are just two losses from tying the longest losing streak in franchise history 12 , set in the 198485 season during their current skid , the knicks' average margin of defeat has been 147 points they have surrendered an average of 102 points while scoring 873 their games have rarely been competitive after the early part of the third quarter meanwhile , basketball in other nba cities appears freshly competitive and even captivating in phoenix , it has been a fastbreak joy ride for those playing with steve nash , the league s reigning most valuable player quentin richardson , who played for the suns last season , remembered it fondly when asked if this was the least fun he has had playing basketball , richardson said by far i lost before , but it s the way the way we lose the knicks lead the nba in turnovers with their most established veteran , point guard stephon marbury , sidelined with a bruised shoulder , the knicks lack cohesiveness their young players get into early foul trouble and when they try to shoot their way out of deficits , they only find themselves in a deeper hole i think each individual on the team , myself included , everybody s got to look in the mirror and say , 'what am i doing , what can i do to make us better , more competitive \? ' richardson said that s the bottom line as isiah thomas , the knicks' president , continues to seek a point guard and another big man , everybody but eddy curry and channing frye appears to be on the trading block brown has identified them as the cornerstones of the team the knicks are interested in trading for portland s theo ratliff despite his sprained left knee knicks players are looking over their shoulders as trade rumors mount , and they seem to be suffering from a crippling lack of confidence we have a hard time fighting back , brown said the recent road swing highlighted the teams' biggest problems in oklahoma city on friday , the knicks defended the hornets poorly all game that set the tone for the next two nights after the loss to the hornets , brown lectured curry on being more aggressive the next day , brown surprised reporters by calling curry the franchise , although the compliment did not lead to improved play after a hot first quarter against houston , curry picked up too many offensive fouls against yao ming and fouled out after scoring 9 points in dallas , he played just 20 minutes and , bothered by knee tendinitis , finished with an unimposing 10 points and 5 rebounds a new observer to this futility is jalen rose , who is 06 as a knick since arriving in a trade with toronto his first two games came down to the final moments , and in both cases the knicks lost with the ball in rose s hands none of their games since then have gone down to the final moments we 're trying to learn how to win , rose said we got guys who are learning how to work for the first time i 've been through this before , rose said of the trade , which took him from a struggling raptors squad to new york i got traded from the indiana pacers , after having the best overall record in the league , to getting traded to the chicago bulls , and they had the worst record in the league i had a couple of choices do i show up and practice hard and play every night or do i moan and pout about it \? rose chose to work hard in chicago and in this situation but it s tough , he added rose lasted a season and a half in chicago he played with younger players , including curry and jamal crawford at the time , many bulls officials said they thought he was more interested in his own statistics than in helping the youth movement in new york , those issues could arise again before the game against the mavericks , brown implored rose to go back to his michigan roots , to when he played point guard for the fab five teams brown wanted rose to set the tone for the team , to show the way in distributing the ball but rose ended up with two assists against dallas , and the knicks finished with 10 now comes toronto , and rose and his teammates will try again , although how hard they try will be closely scrutinized
maybe it s like an nfl secret that you play fantasy football redskins tight end chris cooley an article by jason la canfora of the washington post was perhaps the most amusing offseason story about fantasy football , but it also touched on a more serious issue first , the fun part none of the other redskins admitted to la canfora that they played fantasy football , but chris cooley talked it about freely in fact , cooley told a story about how he beat himself \( in fantasy \) by having a great game \( in reality \) he knocked one of his fantasy teams out of the playoffs last season because of a great game he had against the cowboys i had four teams last year , cooley said , and i made the playoffs with one and honestly lost because i beat myself against dallas the guy on the other team had me , and i scored three touchdowns against dallas , and i lost to myself on fantasy points this next excerpt from the article is interesting in a different way the nfl has no regulations barring active players from participating in fantasy football , league officials said , and if anything , the sport s overseers are supporting the leisure activity like never before although it is widely accepted that money and sometimes substantial sums are involved in most leagues , nfl spokesman brian mccarthy said players are not warned about playing and that the league draws a strict delineation between fantasy sports and betting on games as far as our players participation is concerned , it s highly unlikely a player who participates in fantasy football would alter his performance on the field , mccarthy said we re certainly aware that some fans play for money and on nflcom there are prizes available like a trip to the super bowl but fantasy football is a game of skill , and gambling is not let s play devil s advocate for a moment mccarthy was quoted as saying that it s highly unlikely that a player would alter his performance he didn t say such a thing was impossible because , well , it s not impossible and that s not even addressing the issue of the appearance of a conflict suppose cooley is in a highstakes league and has 1 , 000 riding on a game in which his fantasy facsimile is a participant do i think cooley would tank for a chance to win 1 , 000 \? of course not but does it look bad \? would it make fans raise questions if he had a bad game and they found out about his fantasy participation later \? absolutely so that leads to this question if the league doesn t have a rule against players participating in money leagues , what is it waiting for \?

and therefore that the stuff we think we know now must also be wrong you gave an aesthetic answer , but i think theres also a practical answer the value of a scientific theory is its usefulness in making predictions thus while einstein proved that newtons laws of motion are wrong , they still provide excellent predictions of what moving objects will do in almost all the circumstances most of us are likely to experience if youre driving in a car at 30 miles an hour and your daughter pokes herself out of the sun roof and throws a ball ahead of you at 10 miles an hour relative to you and her , the ball will really appear to be moving at 40 miles an hour to a fixed observer until slowed down by wind resistance you wouldnt really see a problem until you were driving at 130 , 000 miles per second and your daughter threw the ball at a speed of 70 , 000 miles per second then special relativity kicks in and the speed of the ball is less than the speed of light in our ordinary earthbound dogwalking lives were always even unconsciously testing our knowledge of science by making predictions of what will happen next the problems come when we push our imaginations out of our experiential lives into situations where we cant make our own observations , dont make our own predictions , and cant test them tom bodett , dummerston , vt on another night we could have bumped into each other in that pasture where you walk your dogs i suffer a similar disorder what i called compulsive cosmology in a piece i did last week for bob edwards show on xm radio \( read or listen at bodettcom \) it must be that kind of summer thank you for putting background to my meager intellectual flareups there are nights out there in the field ive believed the dog understands as much of it as i do robert c brown , tallahassee , fla a marvelous essay deserves a place alongside goulds on the nature of science should be read by theists and atheists alike what a dry and uninteresting universe is comprehended by my good friend who staunchly believes that the world was formed by god about 10 , 000 years ago he will go to his grave having joyfully missed the real wonder of it all , and what his god was capable of creating john osborn , harvard , mass i suppose the question everyones asking is , what was the good book that you read \? im looking for the 2006 equivalent of the whole shebang , by ferris , now hopelessly overtaken by recency ray valeika , powder springs , ga first of all it is a pleasure to read an article that is well written and causes me to think secondly , the thought occurs that the revelation of scientific knowledge and information is greatly affected by the cultural context when it is presented this often creates the conflict between science and scientific thought and process and religion religion claims certainty based on some very uncertain principles , primarily faith clearly there is nothing uncertain in the minds of the believers science is all about uncertainty but always trying to converge to certainty based on tangible facts and principals the conflict often is the result trying to create religious interpretations of scientific principles and not being satisfied with leaving religion to faith humans do not seem to deal very well without some foundation that to them is certain lastly , how i wish we could catch a ride on a beam of light and see what was passed so we could better see what is ahead of us jeffrey werbock , cherry hill , nj the age of the universe , its size , its origin , whether its static or expanding or contracting the universe is doing none of those things space is inherently curved , therefore we cannot see the end or the beginning thats because there is none but it is not static either rather , the universe is continuously simultaneously expanding and contracting the big bang is a silly idea based on ordinary senses the socalled background radiation is not the residue of some primordial explosion how we humans love an explosion it is merely the presence of random energy on the multitudinous paths of return to a commoncenter , from which a fountain of continuous creation eternally emerges if you point a telescope in any direction , you will be looking toward that center if your telescope is powerful enough and you stand there looking long enough , you will see the back of your own head there is no external force that bends space into curvature curvature is the norm , and on the scale of the universe , it is total very hard for human imaginations to visualize without assistance what is our universe \?

no two movies better exemplify the inherent risks of moviemaking than the black dahlia and la confidential both were truecrime noirs built on the books of james ellroy la confidential was a work of brutal , accomplished storytelling that was nominated for nine academy awards , won two and forced the public to see kim basinger in a new light black dahlia , with the most serious of intentions , came off as sillier than borat and not nearly as entertaining scarlett johansson s shiny career got dented in the process the sight of her waving a cigarette holder while spouting corny period dialogue is etched in the bagger s memory , and we don t mean in a good way chances are good that white jazz , the next movie based on mr ellroy s work , will meet a better fate , if only because george clooney has signed with warner bros to produce and star in it white jazz is the the last book in mr ellroy s la quartet of crime novels , which includes la confidential , the big nowhere and the black dahlia the bagger shared a stage with the author a few months ago and discovered that mr ellroy not only needed no introduction to his adoring audience , he didn t need an interviewer , either he stood the whole time , launching into a profane , inspired soliloquy almost none of which can be reproduced here suffice to say that mr ellroy has a deepseated respect for hollywood s ability to write checks and very little else
to the editor stirring up trouble in puerto rico , by jeane j kirkpatrick and kenneth l adelman \( oped , feb 26 \) , treats us to a heavy dose of imperial arrogance by arguing that uncle sam should refrain from encouraging the natives to get restless in his charming caribbean colony commonwealth \( colonialism \) long ago ceased to be the clear preference of the people today , all local political parties advocate change in puerto rico s status the recent report by president bush s task force on puerto rico s status proposes a first item in its decolonization agenda , a yes or no vote on the current status , rather than a constitutional convention , which our legislature is dead set against far from being on a path to stir up problems where none existed , the task force seeks a responsible solution to a conundrum that has been festering for more than a century the natives are already restless it s too late to try to lure the genie back into the bottle while the united states , governed by dr kirkpatrick s and mr adelman s party , endeavors to endow faraway foreigners with the blessings of democracy at a great cost , it should not ignore the democratic aspirations of four million of its own kenneth d mcclintock president , puerto rico senate san juan , pr , feb 28 , 2006
to the sports editor i have little interest in watching 22 highly paid grown men run around for 90 minutes waiting for one \( or two or none \) of them to score a goal but a major shortcoming seems to have escaped the aficionados of this sport where the outcome of the game can hinge on a single successful penalty kick , the potential damage that can be inflicted by an incompetent referee is magnified tremendously unlike american football \( or baseball or basketball \) , in which bad calls affect both sides , and usually even out , in soccer there is little chance of a horrendous call being compensated robert a myers new york
upon arriving at his new place of business , bobby abreu said , if i get that ring , that s all that matters ah , that ring , that elusive ring abreu has come to the right place he has lots of company in players seeking that elusive ring that would be a world series ring the bauble that goes to players on a winning world series team is the most desired piece of jewelry in professional sports hardly anyone talks as much about a super bowl ring or an nba ring , certainly not a stanley cup ring but baseball players talk all the time about getting a world series ring they might have a 252 million contract or a 19 million salary , but they talk as if the money does n't matter the ring is the thing a free agent signs a humongous contract with the yankees and says it s not the money the yankees give him the best chance to get a ring and just how has that seeming advantage helped newer members of the yankees \? do they proudly wear their world series rings on their fingers , or do they keep them locked away in a safe deposit box to guard against someone else getting their fingers on them \? it so happens that no one who has joined the yankees , through free agency or trade or promotion from the minor leagues , since the end of the 2000 season has earned a world series ring in fact , the only players on the current team who have rings with the yankees are derek jeter , bernie williams , mariano rivera and jorge posada mike mussina \? no ring jason giambi \? no ring alex rodriguez , hideki matsui \? no rings gary sheffield , randy johnson , johnny damon and mike myers have world series rings from championships with other teams , but none with the yankees of course , damon and myers are in their first year with the yankees so they ca n't be blamed for the absence of a ringing achievement at yankee stadium mussina \( twice \) and giambi and matsui \( once each \) have played in the world series with the yankees , but the yankees lost to arizona in 2001 and to florida in 2003 after the marlins beat the yankees in six games in 2003 , jeffrey loria , the team s owner , gave his players the largest , gaudiest and most ostentatious ring ever made for a championship team weighing 388 ounces , it is gold and adorned with 228 diamonds , 13 rubies and one teal diamond forget the rubies , forget the teal diamond , just get mussina a ring he might settle for a cigar band at this stage of his career he is in the final year of the sixyear contract he signed with the yankees on nov 30 , 2000 , and he is 0 for 5 in bids for world series rings at the age of 37 , he is having the best season of his six with the yankees and could think of no better way to conclude it than winning the world series and getting that ring but not only ca n't he think about the world series , he also ca n't think of the playoffs because unlike in his first five years , the yankees' path to the postseason has too many potential ruts the yankees are among five or six teams competing for three playoff spots two division titles and the wild card and only the detroit tigers seem to be assured one of them the addition of abreu may make up for some of the lost offense with the injuries to sheffield and matsui , but what cory lidle does in the starting rotation figures to be more critical to the yankees' effort to play postseason games for the 12th consecutive year and if abreu and the others are to get their rings , the yankees have to qualify for october play the last time the yankees went six seasons without winning the world series was in the first half of the 1990 s that s not too long ago , but for mussina , giambi and their newer teammates it might as well be the 1890 s in 2001 , mussina and his teammates were just about standing in line to have their fingers measured for the rings they would receive on opening day the following season it was mussina s first season with the yankees , and it justified his decision to sign with them but after alfonso soriano s leadoff home run in the eighth inning of game 7 gave the yankees a 21 lead , randy johnson , who would become mussina s teammate three years later , shut down the yankees , retiring all four batters he faced , and the diamondbacks rallied for two runs against rivera in the ninth rivera did not get his fifth ring mussina did n't get his first he s still waiting so is rodriguez , but he has n't come as close as mussina arod might have joined damon and myers in getting rings in 2004 if a proposed texasboston trade had gone through but as desperately as he wanted to leave the rangers , who had been a lastplace team in each of his three seasons with them , rodriguez was unable to because the players union objected to boston s proposed changes in his contract he subsequently approved a trade to the yankees and was in their lineup when they won the first three games of the league series against the red sox one victory from the world series , five victories from a ringading celebration , the yankees did n't win another game with mussina and the others , arod waits now abreu has joined them photos from left , randy johnson , mike mussina , jason giambi and alex rodriguez await a world series ring as yankees johnson won one at arizona \( photographs by robert caplin for the new york times left , barton silverman the new york times \)
the portable global positioning systems that drivers have been increasingly putting into their cars have become the new targets of thieves in westchester county police departments are reporting that there have been a wave of thefts of the units , which often cost 300 to 1 , 000 there has definitely been an increase , said lt robert koziak , of the mamaroneck police department , who said seven units had been stolen in town in the last few months we had seen none of these six months ago more than 20 gps units had been taken from cars parked in shopping centers in yonkers and greenburgh this year , but the pace of thefts slowed after the greenburgh police arrested two men in september when we arrested them , they had two gps units taken from cars parked along the central avenue corridor , one from near the yonkers border and the other from the white plains border , said capt joseph delio of the greenburgh police and westchester is not alone while the connecticut state police said they had not seen an increase in gps thefts , the police in new jersey have , although they said they believed the thefts were tied to one man in paramus , about 60 units were taken from shopping center parking lots earlier this year before the police arrested a queens man in may and charged him with burglary , theft and possession of stolen property he would break the window and look under the seat and grab the device , said capt kevin smith of the paramus police department he told us he got 75 to 100 per unit in the bronx in the four months since his arrest , we have had maybe four or five thefts the portable units that often attach to a windshield or sit on the dashboard , not the factory installed systems , are the ones primarily stolen by thieves , said detective sgt scott sullivan of the westchester county police department i liken this phenomenon with what we 've seen with airbags , xenon lights and certain radio systems , sergeant sullivan said it s a matter of where there is a market for these things so far this year , the units have also been stolen from cars parked at several train stations , including in white plains , new castle and croton falls , he said the number of portable units delivered to retailers has risen , according to steve koenig , a spokesman for the consumer electronics association this year , an estimated 23 million units are expected to be delivered , up from 700 , 000 last year manufacturers like garmin and magellan are encouraging their customers to remove the system , its mount and any mark left by the mount when they leave their car garmin also offers password protection on some models even if portable units have passwords , thieves may not get the word , said frank scafidi , a spokesman for the national insurance crime bureau , which specializes in auto theft and insurance fraud research most of these knuckleheads will think that they can plugandplay these in another vehicle , mr scafidi said we saw that same application with the headlight thefts that were occurring in the northeast a few years ago after manufacturers made it almost impossible to use the headlights unless you had the factoryinstalled wiring , they were still getting ripped off photos recovered detectives paul r fertig , left , and robert prescott of the greenburgh police department with gps units on display gps devices and tools used to get in cars \( photographs by alan zale for the new york times \)
to the editor re haunted by the past , by maureen dowd \( column , nov 1 \) in formulating his response to the inevitable questions about his inexperience , senator barack obama has emphasized the importance of judgment but since we can never know in advance whether a judgment will prove to be sound or flawed , we must consider what personal qualities are likely to generate good judgments experience is certainly one factor the other is intelligence the public has not heard much from mr obama yet , but every speech he delivers seems to reflect deep , critical and original thought it also seems that mr obama earned his places at columbia and harvard through his own achievements , rather than hereditary privilege , and that those experiences had a meaningful impact on him none of these things are true of president bush , whom the media have politely called incurious for the last six years as a new presidential cycle begins , we should speak frankly about the kind of intellectual sophistication that the presidency requires which mr obama appears to have , and which mr bush sorely lacks ron meyers new york , nov 1 , 2006

in the early 1990 s , when chinese contemporary art was just beginning to take off , a young painter here named zhou tiehai came up with an ambitious plan to make himself famous he would succeed by beating the art market at its own game , exposing its commercialism while exploiting it to the hilt he would produce paintings that he hoped would be acclaimed by the same western collectors and journalists who , in his mind , had advanced the careers of too many mediocre chinese artists and he would do all this without lifting a brush he would delegate that work to hirelings somehow , he pulled it off mr zhou is now one of china s hottest artists his meteoric rise from marginalized rebel to mainstream superstar culminated in a solo exhibition of his works at the shanghai art museum in march many of the biggest names in chinese contemporary art were on hand for the opening mr zhou choked up with tears , seemingly awed by the lofty stage he had ascended for more than a decade , his work has mocked the art scene in an era when every leading chinese artist seems to have a recognizable brand , a series of obvious signature pieces , mr zhou slyly appropriated joe camel from the american cigarette ads and transformed it into his own improbable brand \( many people here refer to mr zhou pronounced joe as the joe camel guy \) now important collectors boast of owning his paintings his works , which command prices as high as 100 , 000 , have been shown in new york , london and at the venice biennale that he does n't paint them himself seems to make little difference , even , or perhaps especially , to those clued in to his game karen smith , a beijingbased art critic , calls him the child who dares to suggest the emperor is indeed naked others hail him as a marketing genius the fact that he does n't paint much does n't bother me , said uli sigg , a former swiss ambassador to china and a major collector of chinese contemporary art jeff koons does n't touch anything bridget riley has workers it s accepted today it does n't have to have traces of your own hand in an interview in his studio here , mr zhou , 39 , said that what was most important was the concept behind the work you need to get someone s attention , he said , sipping tea as three of his workers busily sketched and painted \( sometimes with air brushes \) a variety of portraits he had first drafted on computer typically mr zhou comes up with an idea for example , transposing the head of joe camel onto a classical european painting , which he then executes on his computer using photoshop after that , staff members take over , using a printout of the image as a guide when mr zhou recounts the story of his own improbable rise , he ca n't help chuckling , as if the joke were on the foreign collectors and journalists now flocking to his studio from the beginning i knew i 'd be successful , he said it s really not that hard to create art although he does n't paint anymore , mr zhou says that he can he grew up in shanghai and in 1989 earned an arts degree from the school of fine arts at shanghai university while in college , he painted and created collages on discarded newspapers as beijing s avantgarde movement got under way in the late 1980 s , he formed his own circle of artists here and even experimented with performance art it was mostly violent stuff , he said i would sometimes stick needles in people onstage when his career failed to take off , mr zhou took a job at an advertising agency , producing commercials for stateowned television but before long he regretted his decision to drop out of the art world in 1993 , he met the american writer andrew solomon , who was working on an article about chinese contemporary art for the new york times magazine mr solomon looked at his work but did not mention him in the article mr zhou was frustrated again after he ran into a newsweek photographer who had come to china to take pictures of top artists she had a list of all the political pop artists , mr zhou said but i was n't on the list so i decided to come back determined to make it , mr zhou said , he analyzed the contemporary art scene in china it was dominated , he said by westernstyle paintings studded with patently chinese elements , such as images of mao or references to the cultural revolution that easily caught the eye \( and pocketbooks \) of foreign collectors the way foreigners thought about chinese art was too simple , he said they just thought about politics so i thought i 'd do something different and he did mr zhou said he decided it would not be necessary for him to do the painting himself , since , to his thinking , his competitors were not terribly skilled painters anyway his initial subject matter was what he saw as the absurdities of the art market one early work pictured mr solomon , the writer who had passed him over , as columbus discovering the new world of chinese contemporary art then came a series of fake magazine covers , including one of newsweek proclaiming mr zhou a rising star , and a fake newspaper article about a stock called zhou tiehai that went public and steadily gained value thanks to foreign buyers he also made a short silent film , will , which depicts a band of artists eager to build their own airport to lure more collectors to shanghai we must continue having exhibitions to draw attention to ourselves , one artist says in a caption , while another adds we must establish close relationships with critics and journalists none of this , of course , was a solitary act of creation mr zhou hired a team of artists to execute his ideas this left him free , he says , to focus on refining his concepts , and networking with collectors and gallery owners like lorenz helbling , founder of the shanghart gallery i came to shanghai in '94 and saw his works on paper , mr helbling said i thought he was interesting i remember a belgian collector came to my home to look at some works he found one of zhou s pieces in a suitcase and he got excited about it that was in 1996 , and it was one of the first pieces mr zhou sold , mr helbling said later , mr zhou s work caught the eye of other big collectors like mr sigg the fact that he criticized the system brought him right into it , mr sigg said in a telephone interview it was a clever strategy since then , mr zhou s evolving series of joe camel paintings have become his signature work mr zhou calls joe camel a likable character but many in the art industry here say it is more clever than that joe camel , they say , is the prototypical westerner \( westerners are often referred to as big noses in china \) , but also mr zhou s alter ego his joe camel is a globetrotter who likes to play in the western art world , wears dark sunglasses and does mischievous things , like inserting himself , zeliglike , into paintings of historical scenes in creating his own brand , mr zhou says he has beaten china s great artists at their own game , and no one really seems to mind on april 23 in shanghai , there was an art show opening for zhou chunya , best known for his green dog series many of china s most successful artists were there , including mr zhou at the banquet afterward , upstairs at a fashionable restaurant , he strolled among tables , cigarette and wine glass in hand , hugging fellow artists and joining them in toasts he was now firmly in the inner circle asked how it felt , he grinned and said ten years ago i wanted to show people how easy it is to make art and i did that now i'm on the list photos zhou tiehai at his studio in shanghai a team of assistants produces mr zhou s work from his computer mockups \( photo by chang w lee the new york times \) \( pg e1 \) in zhou tiehai s

politicians are incompetent , and they pay too much attention to public opinion or so a substantial number of corporate leaders attending the world economic forum here say they believe unsurprisingly , the corporate leaders thought better of business leaders , but a handful of them said business executives were dishonest and behaved unethically the world economic forum conducted the poll before the forum began , and received responses from 208 corporate leaders who were planning to attend the sample is small , and the data may not be representative of all senior corporate leaders , but it may indicate attitudes that color relations between businesses and governments around the world asked if the politicians were too sensitive to public opinion , 63 percent agreed and 40 percent think that government leaders respond to pressure from people more powerful than themselves the poll did not ask who those people were , although some in the public no doubt would think that some corporate leaders fell into that category twentyseven percent agreed that political leaders are not capable and competent about the same percentage thought that political leaders behave unethically and even more , 36 percent , said politicians are dishonest of course , not as many corporate leaders think badly of themselves only 1 percent thought business leaders were not capable and competent but 5 percent thought corporate leaders behaved unethically and 16 percent thought business leaders were dishonest just 40 percent of the corporate leaders thought business executives respond to pressure from people more powerful than themselves perhaps some of the remainder were not sure there were such people and most executives do not deem business leaders to be slaves to public pressure only 15 percent thought they were too sensitive to public opinion and while 25 percent of the executives thought politicians have too much power and responsibility , just 13 percent thought that was true of business leaders many government leaders also attend the forum but only 10 of them chose to respond to the survey for what it is worth , half of those thought political leaders had too much power and responsibility and while only one deemed politicians to be dishonest , three thought they acted unethically none thought business leaders were dishonest , but three deemed them to be unethical as for the media , it received a rather confusing and mixed review on one hand , about 70 percent of corporate officials said they relied on newspapers and magazines for analysis of political events in their countries and the world and 70 percent of corporate leaders agreed , while only 19 percent disagreed , with the statement that media over all is a force for good in the world but that does not necessarily mean that the media are trusted asked if the media are objective enough , 73 percent said it was not , to just 20 percent who said it was and by a slim plurality of 44 to 41 percent , corporate leaders agreed with the statement , i do n't trust journalists to tell the truth the political sample was much smaller , of course , but five of them did trust the journalists , while two did not what that would appear to mean is that at least some business leaders think journalists cannot be trusted to tell the truth , but nonetheless rely on them for analysis of what is happening in the world chart what business leaders think of politicians and themselves a poll of 208 corporate leaders attending the world economics forum asked if they agreed with a series of unflattering assessments of political and corporate leaders the bars below show the percentage who agreed with each statement others either disagreed or had no opinion assessments they are too sensitive to public opinion which of these apply to political leaders \? 63 which of these do you think apply to business leaders \? 15 they respond to pressure from people more powerful than themselves which of these apply to political leaders \? 40 which of these do you think apply to business leaders \? 40 they are dishonest which of these apply to political leaders \? 36 which of these do you think apply to business leaders \? 5 they behave unethically which of these apply to political leaders \? 28 which of these do you think apply to business leaders \? 16 they are not capable and competent which of these apply to political leaders \? 27 which of these do you think apply to business leaders \? 1 they have too much power and responsibility which of these apply to political leaders \? 25 which of these do you think apply to business leaders \? 13 do n't know no response which of these apply to political leaders \? 14 which of these do you think apply to business leaders \? 40 \( source by world economic forum \)
one of the biggest parenting stories recently has been the news that dr richard ferber , the pediatric sleep expert known for his ferberizing technique of forcing babies to learn to soothe themselves to sleep at night has softened his opposition to babies bedsharing with parents seems he s awoken to the notion of temperament what works for some children simply doesn t work for others this is a major score for the touchyfeely team in the parent wars that boil under the surface of so much forcedly polite brunch table interaction \( do you breastfeed \? how much \? where \? reject all trans fats \? brush your hair \? ever \? \) i have a reputation now for being against breastfeeding , proseparation , promakeup and pretty meanspirited , generally none of that happens to be true when my daughters were babies , i coslept i breastfed for what in france , where i had my children , was viewed as a very long time i cooked my own baby food and wore a halo , generally at least until i moved back from france to the united states and keeping that halo aloft proved too impossibly exhausting in france , i was the butt of a great many jokes about my jewish mother childrearing techniques i worried that my 3yearold might drown if left to wander unattended around an unfenced swimming pool i held up countless dinner parties , letting food grow cool and tempers grow short , while i rocked and sang and soothed my unferberized babies to sleep i persisted in breastfeeding them exclusively despite the clear indications to my friends that they were starving for solid food the prevailing attitude in france towards babies bedtime rituals was best summed up by the advice a doctor once gave to my best american friend and her french husband you have a door close it i just couldn t bring myself to follow that advice i gritted my teeth and did things my way , even though i looked to the french like a lunatic , even though my new mommy attire \( shapeless dresses post partum , sneakers for the playground , a certain disheveledness , generally \) earned me the sobriquet of due a and , more than once , led other parents to mistake me for a fille au pair  but did i cosleep to the conflicted extent that i did because i believed it was right for my baby \? on the contrary i was quite sure that it was wrong my motherinlaw had frightened me with the story of a baby who d suffocated when she fell behind a mattress , and i was terrified of stifling my daughter with my body or with pillows \( the mattress story , by the way , really should be a cautionary tale to those parents , recently cited by the new york times , who push beds together the better to cosleep with their babies also see the arguments against cosleeping by the american academy of pediatrics task force on sids \) i knew perfectly well that what cosleeping i did i did for me because it was incredibly cozy , incredibly comforting , incredibly easy i still remember how , one night in london with my husband back in paris , i looked forward , with a kind of illicit pleasure , to bedtime another woman might have been waiting in a hotel room for her lover i relished the prospect of sleeping in a single bed alone with my 1yearold , who had moved on to a crib at home i will admit that i often envied my french friends for the efficiency and effectiveness of their childrearing techniques their children were always immaculate , wellbehaved and courteous they knew how to behave at the dinner table , ate wellbalanced meals , didn t whine incessantly for pasta and managed to entertain themselves with a small fraction of the toys that were , increasingly , crowding my husband and me out of our apartment , where our children seemed to be permanently covered in chocolate and while americans , i am sure , would rush to predict that those french kids toilettrained at 18 months and learning to color within the lines soon afterwards would be scarred for life , i m not so sure a recent study , conducted in six countries by researchers at duke university s center for child and family policy , showed that spanking causes increased levels of aggression and anxiety in children but only in cultures where it s not the norm so many of the things we consider to be universals in parenting , like the right way to feed , to put to sleep , to praise children and to discipline them , are culturally specific both in practice and in prevalence and , it turns out , in their psychological effects at any rate , it s hard to distinguish between the actual effects of our actions on our babies and the meaning we ascribe to those actions retrospectively within normal , healthy limits , what we do , how we feed , how we sleep , how we talk , whether we read to our kids for a halfhour each day or for six \( as i , craziest of all the crazies , sometimes did \) , doesn t really matter very much in the long term , i m starting to think so long as we do what we do with kindness and with love for the record i have no id es fixes about what s right to do for babies , or for mothers , for that matter i have only one fixed idea about what s wrong ascribing selfless mommy virtue to acts that most mothers , in fact , do for their own benefit
to the editor in a risky place to gather news , a very familiar story \( memo from russia , oct 11 \) says of the recent assassinations in russia that none of the victims were radicals or revolutionaries , or , to use an old word , dissidents that is , fringe figures operating outside the established law of the land most soviet dissidents were not fringe figures , either among their ranks were a general in the soviet army \( petro g grigorenko \) , a decorated member of the soviet academy of sciences \( andrei d sakharov \) and a member of the union of soviet writers \( aleksandr i solzhenitsyn \) if anything , the dissidents were accused of being overly concentrated in the elite urban intelligentsia one of their key strategies was to promote the rule of law by operating strictly within the bounds of the soviet constitution and legal code more important , they encouraged the soviet government to do the same today s russia may have more to learn from its recent soviet past than it realizes benjamin nathans philadelphia , oct 11 , 2006 the writer is an associate professor of history at the university of pennsylvania

on friday , paul krugman got his revenge on me back in september 2003 , i wrote a column that was rather rough on him in it , i likened him to donald duck during one of his tirades , with steam pouring out of his ears , because he seemed so angry all the time mr krugman makes it seem as if i was criticizing him just for his attacks on george w bush now , since i have become a critic of mr bush myself , he feels vindicated he wonders where i have been all these years , while people like him were manning the barricades by themselves that s a fair question first , let me say that i am still a republican unlike arianna huffington , i haven t switched sides i voted for mr bush twice and would do so again if faced with al gore or john kerry as my alternative i think they were awful candidates who ran dreadful campaigns that s not to say i would never vote for a democrat i have said on the record that if there were an election today between mr bush and bill clinton , i would vote for mr clinton as i explain in my book , at least on economics , he had much better policies i believe that if mr gore had simply run as if he would fulfill his predecessor s third term , he would have won easily that s the strategy george hw bush followed in 1988 and it worked brilliantly why mr gore felt compelled to reinvent himself is a mystery to me i think mr kerry could have won a lot of disaffected conservatives votes if he simply had reached out to them one argument he could have made is that republican control of congress required a democrat in the white house to provide balance many conservatives would have bought this argument , because they know that republicans in congress are much more principled and conservative when there is a democrat in the white house a key reason for mr clinton s good economic policies finally , i think the shrillness and nastiness of much of the leftliberal critique of mr bush has tended to keep disaffected conservatives inside the bush camp , despite their misgivings about him that is really what i was getting at in my column about mr krugman i think he would have been far more effective in his criticism of mr bush if he had stuck to his area of expertise economics and maintained a more calm and judicious tone in his columns getting back to my own evolution i was never a big supporter of george w bush , but i hoped for the best when he was elected he appointed a number of my friends whose expertise i respected to highlevel positions and i thought they would convince him to adopt the right policies i believed that the best way to help that happen was to praise mr bush when he did the right things , rather than attacking him when he did the wrong things using the carrot rather than the stick , so to speak moreover , i was at the time employed by a very probush think tank in dallas being supportive of mr bush was definitely more rewarding to me than being critical unlike mr krugman , i had no tenure and feared for my job should i have been seen as being antibush so for the first two years of the mr bush s presidency , i tried to see the glass as half full but after he rammed the massively expensive medicare drug benefit through congress in november 2003 , i realized he was not any sort of conservative that i recognized i explain in my book why i think this is one of the worst pieces of legislation in history subsequently , i found it harder and harder to find anything positive to say about mr bush s policies i began to see the glass as halfempty some people now criticize me for not being more public with my criticism of mr bush in 2004 , when it might have done some good but in fact , my columns at that time became much more critical and i was much less supportive of mr bush in newspaper interviews and such one interview in particular almost cost me my job an important factor in my alienation from mr bush which didn t happen all at once was reading ron suskind s book , the price of loyalty , published in early 2004 based on extensive interviews with former treasury secretary paul o neill , it painted a devastating portrait of a thoroughly dysfunctional administration just before the election , mr suskind published an article in the new york times magazine that quoted me at length saying highly critical things about mr bush i was chastised by my employer for these comments after the election , i started planning a book about mr bush s economic policies now that my book , impostor how george w bush bankrupted america and betrayed the reagan legacy , has been published , readers can decide for themselves whether it would have made any difference in the outcome if it had been published before the 2004 election i don t think so two other conservative critiques of mr bush appeared without having much impact the bush betrayal by james bovard , and where the right went wrong by pat buchanan the reason they failed , i think , is that most conservatives were still united in their defense of mr bush against intense liberal attacks they weren t ready to hear about mr bush s failures , even from a conservative viewpoint it would have been seen as giving aid and comfort to the enemy but now i think they are ready the end of the bush presidency is in sight and republicans must necessarily choose his replacement that means they have to consider mr bush s program and what parts of it they want his successor either to keep or jettison if all this makes me a johnnycomelately bush critic , then so be it in the end , i was fired from my thinktank job without severance for writing my book that s a price none of my critics have had to pay

of the sound would be protected from all sewage by next spring robert w varney , regional administrator for the environmental protection agency in new england , said the designation would result in substantial water quality improvements in the waters all along the sound to be approved for a ban on treated sewage in a particular area , the state must show it has enough pumpout stations where boaters can clear their sewage the state already has dozens of such stations dennis schain , a spokesman for the department of environmental protection , said that while treated sewage was not as bad

you know that moment when the new dentist first looks in your mouth and asks , who did this to you \? it has come to me that this is a generalizable moment repeated in interactions with practitioners of any kind there s the auto mechanic who explains to you that your old mechanic put in the wrong sparkplugs or rotated tires that aren t supposed to be rotated or didn t realize , as any fool who had listened to 10 minutes of npr s cartalk would have , that the engine oil he was using was the wrong weight or viscosity for your model there s the house cleaner who tells you that his or her predecessor cleaned your wood floors with a solution sure to ruin them there s the tree person who tells you that your prize something or other has been incorrectly pruned in the past and will never flourish again in the past few months , and as the result of having made the mistake of trying to move into a house and renovate it at the same time , my wife and i have been having the who did this to you \? experience in spades there was the general contractor who told us that the deck that had been designed for us couldn t be built the other contractor \( i think he was the fifth \) who told us that the columns drawn in the design were against code and therefore illegal the landscaper who told us that we didn t have to bother about code and had wasted time and money worrying about it the builder who said that replacing the windows was a big mistake and would cause no end of problems the other builder who said it was a piece of cake a third builder who said that the deck should have been built first and the driveway and walkway pavers installed last instead of the other way around the electrician who declared that the work done by the previous crew of electricians was not grounded , sometimes not connected to anything and very dangerous the house painter who said that the prep work and the power washing our handyman had done would have to be done all over again the handyman who regularly announced that none of those we had engaged \( except his uncle \) knew what they were doing the pondmaintenance man who informed us that the new pond didn t have enough filters or pipes or something and we would probably have to add more the airconditioning technician who advised us to call florida light and power immediately and have the dire situation assessed the architect who said that we should have gotten permits before doing anything the other architect who said we didn t have to get permits at all and wondered why we had ever been told otherwise in part , the problem was that every new person we interviewed seemed incredibly knowledgeable and spoke with such assurance and in such detail that we immediately felt confidence in him our troubles are over goodbye slipshod unprofessional work hello total competence that s the guy too bad we didn t meet him first , we would say to each other , until the next guy turned up and then we would say it again more times than i can count we were promised , in almost these words , that our troubles were over i hate to see you good folks taken advantage of and that from here on in everything would be fine it never was at first that is , for the first two months the psychology was such that we truly did believe , repeatedly , that were finally home free and then , after so many discoveries that all the previous right guys had been wrong , we came to the conclusion that there was no right guy and that we would be lucky to get out of this with our sanity , because we certainly weren t going to get out of it with our money live and not learn
my older son , gabriel , is in his room , propped up on elbows over a copy of ripley s believe it or not ! hey mom , want to see a picture of the man with fireproof skin \? i sit beside him and peer at the photo of a man who holds a torch to his body with no apparent repercussions awesome next , he shows me the smiling woman , arms knotted behind her back then another who writes her name with both hands simultaneously upside down and backwards wow like many 10yearolds , mine is fascinated by the amazing , strange , inexplicable , weird and all true found within these 500 pages who can blame him \? different is interesting different is cool but different can also be deeply troubling when it s happening to you last year , i had to label my son md \( multiply disabled \) , a broad classification for children with a combination of learning problems most recently , we changed the label to something beginning with the letter a the hardest thing i 'd ever done what is a , you wonder \? attention deficit disorder \? anxiety \? autism \? can we hold off a moment , please \? there s so much more to tell last march , the big yellow school bus stopped coming by our house instead , a small van now takes my boy off to a special school everything is different now so much is better the labeling game is a tricky one like any good parent , i wanted no part of it i intended to emphasize my child s strengths , not spend years studying his problems and repeating them over and over again to teachers , therapists and lawyers in order to get help years ago , i developed my own labels to explain my son s uniqueness gifted , scientist , voracious reader , dry wit , outoftheboxthinker , shy , creativeprobablyanartist and kind older brother but none of these labels could explain why such a bright child could not survive in a public school why , in kindergarten , he was alone at lunch why , in first grade , it seemed he was writing with paws rather than hands why , in second grade , he could not pay attention why , by third grade , he developed insomnia , became nauseous each morning , and said he would rather die than go to school and why , by fourth grade , he looked me in the eye one morning and said , teeth gritted , i am not going the only way to get him up would have been with a crane now that the van comes each day , we 've had an astonishing turnaround he calmly goes out the door , like , well , a norma i mean , a typical child he attends a class with 12 students , receives motivating points for good behavior , has successes and is accepted and respected for who he is suddenly , we are all feeling hopeful and whole again the label which i once feared and despised may have saved our lives of course , lots of people are skeptical about all these learning disabilities that have suddenly beset our society where did all this dyslexia , and add , and autism come from \? we did n't have all this stuff back then we turned out all right i'm not so sure what about the alcoholics , the chronically unemployed , the angry antisocial loners of the past \? what was at the root of their problems \? new developments in neuroscience and brain imaging now reveal that learning disabilities are not a fad , not an excuse , not a reflection of baby boomers' obsession with their children but the result of brain wiring that is different from typical brains sure , it s good to be skeptical about labels plenty of children with academic troubles do n't require classification , and most do n't need special schools diagnoses can be baffling and imprecise doctors do n't always agree \( ours sure did n't at first \) , and symptoms may be nebulous some fit , others do not like many children with learning difficulties , our son has a plateful of overlapping challenges it s hard to know which one is in charge some days , my guy does n't look like he has any of the a s but once we got a decent diagnosis \( one that fit at least most of the time \) , we began to cope we found the right people to help , and other parents who understood perhaps , most important , we began to forgive our son will have to work harder we 'll all have to work harder but we understand now that he is not lazy or naturally defiant , and his path will be unique in his book the misunderstood child , dr larry b silver , a clinical professor of psychiatry at georgetown , poignantly describes his own tortured experience having learning disabilities and writes that at least 10 percent of schoolage children have them our own psychiatrist makes a larger estimate he says , listen , there s a 50 percent chance you 'll get at least a little bit of something here he s talking about the whole gamut of psychiatric quirks , conditions and syndromes , not all of which even merit treatment but the idea is a comfort sort of like ripley s busting open our ideas of normal to a bigger and more accepting place complain if you wish about video games and the stresses of our modern world this is one area where we as a society are improving as we accept the big variety of human life gabriel , what do you think of the term 'learning difference' \? i think it s fair , he replies it s better than learning disabilities i hate that term it makes you sound like you 're mentally ill or something what do you think of the term asperger s syndrome \? i ask cautiouslyfor yes , this is his label , a neurobiological condition at the highfunctioning end of the autism spectrum symptoms range in intensity but include social difficulties , developmental delays , some quirky behaviors and , sometimes , great talents \( parents love to tell you that einstein and mozart probably had it , too \) you say i have this , he replies but i really have no idea what it means then he adds you know , it would have been much easier not to have all this i know i'm different but i do n't feel different at all , really it s just like i'm me most of the time i just try to act like normal do you mean typical \? ok , typical i try to act typical i only want to pay attention to my learning difference when i have to i ask for the twentieth time how he likes his new school i like it , he replies calmly and maturely i feel better i see that mine is n't the only problem some kids have it worse some have it better and , mom , you 've asked me enough now really , you do n't need to ask me again i do like it to tell you the truth , we 're feeling more typical each day yes , we 've got a lot ahead but it s time to give labels and worries a rest right now things are going well it s time to focus on the positives and his individuality , and the divine spark of how we never know where the future will lead no label can predict drawing \( drawing by alex nabaum \)
after viewing more than 400 entries and picking 155 of them to run in the long island international film expo in july , you 'd think its director , debra markowitz , and her team of jurors would have liked a break from the movies instead , they 've been sorting through films and videos for another event , the new long island big fish film festival , which runs oct 16 to 19 at the bellmore movies and showcases the works of local filmmakers , as well as films that were shot at least partly on long island \( broadly defined to include queens and brooklyn \) the new festival aims to offer independent films a chance to be discovered and become big fish in what is no longer so small a pond there s a really vibrant talent pool out here , said ms markowitz , director of the nassau county film office during the expo selection process , ms markowitz said , she realized there were many more interesting indie films than could ever be shown at that festival we were looking at cards and saying , 'yeah , this was really good , ca n't we fit it in somewhere \? ' ms markowitz recalled as a fledgling festival , the big fish is welcoming a broad array of films some were entered into this year s expo , or earlier ones , but none won a major prize others did n't make it into the expo , while still others are new to the expo jurors while the selection for the big fish was n't complete late last month , ms markowitz estimated that 20 films would be selected , out of about 45 entries , 33 of them with nassau or suffolk roots we do n't really know what to expect , she added we 're starting from a concept , an idea of giving a second chance to films that might not otherwise get seen that is what is happening to new york minute , a taut , fiveminute psychological thriller by michael j arbouet that was shown at the 2004 expo , but ended up back on my shelf , mr arbouet said now , it s off the shelf again , for the big fish you never know who s going to show up at a film festival , and if the right person sees it , you may get your break , he said another entry without a distributor is heads or tails , a 22minute documentarycumrealityshow whose participants go on dates with their pets in tow wherever they go , the pets go , to see how all interact , said sheryl matthys of westhampton beach , who found her participants on craigslist at least nine of the big fish entries are already commercially available , most of them on dvd s the feature ghosts never sleep , with some name actors tony goldwyn , sean young and faye dunaway shown at the 2005 expo , was released on dvd last month a thriller set in the seedy fringes of the film industry , ghosts does n't have a whole lot of money behind it for marketing , said christopher joyce , a los angeles screenwriter who was living on long island when he began the semiautobiographical script \( the film s director , steve freedman , now shares writing credit \) so any exposure is good , mr joyce said if the festival handed out an award for most unusual reason for entering , it might well go to mary scott , of melville , whose fulllength documentary , wings of their own , is an homage to women pilots the whole purpose of the film is to get people to fly , said ms scott i like the fact that the big fish is in october , so the flying weather is still good long island big fish film festival , oct 16 to 19 , bellmore \( 516 \) 5720012 www longislandfilm com photo tired eyes debra markowitz heads the big fish film festival \( photo by kirk condyles for the new york times \)
the portable global positioning systems that drivers have been increasingly putting into their cars have become the new targets of thieves in westchester county police departments are reporting that there have been a wave of thefts of the units , which often cost 300 to 1 , 000 there has definitely been an increase , said lt robert koziak , of the mamaroneck police department , who said seven units had been stolen in town in the last few months we had seen none of these six months ago more than 20 gps units had been taken from cars parked in shopping centers in yonkers and greenburgh this year , but the pace of thefts slowed after the greenburgh police arrested two men in september when we arrested them , they had two gps units taken from cars parked along the central avenue corridor , one from near the yonkers border and the other from the white plains border , said capt joseph delio of the greenburgh police and westchester is not alone while the connecticut state police said they had not seen an increase in gps thefts , the police in new jersey have , although they said they believed the thefts were tied to one man in paramus , about 60 units were taken from shopping center parking lots earlier this year before the police arrested a queens man in may and charged him with burglary , theft and possession of stolen property he would break the window and look under the seat and grab the device , said capt kevin smith of the paramus police department he told us he got 75 to 100 per unit in the bronx in the four months since his arrest , we have had maybe four or five thefts the portable units that often attach to a windshield or sit on the dashboard , not the factory installed systems , are the ones primarily stolen by thieves , said detective sgt scott sullivan of the westchester county police department i liken this phenomenon with what we 've seen with airbags , xenon lights and certain radio systems , sergeant sullivan said it s a matter of where there is a market for these things so far this year , the units have also been stolen from cars parked at several train stations , including in white plains , new castle and croton falls , he said the number of portable units delivered to retailers has risen , according to steve koenig , a spokesman for the consumer electronics association this year , an estimated 23 million units are expected to be delivered , up from 700 , 000 last year manufacturers like garmin and magellan are encouraging their customers to remove the system , its mount and any mark left by the mount when they leave their car garmin also offers password protection on some models even if portable units have passwords , thieves may not get the word , said frank scafidi , a spokesman for the national insurance crime bureau , which specializes in auto theft and insurance fraud research most of these knuckleheads will think that they can plugandplay these in another vehicle , mr scafidi said we saw that same application with the headlight thefts that were occurring in the northeast a few years ago after manufacturers made it almost impossible to use the headlights unless you had the factoryinstalled wiring , they were still getting ripped off photos on display gps devices and tools used to get in cars recovered detectives paul r fertig , left , and robert prescott of the greenburgh police department with gps units \( photographs by alan zale for the new york times \)

no selborne journal today gilbert white will be back tomorrow here is the thing about a gravel road if you come upon something worth watching or listening to , you can pull over to the side , roll down the windows , and turn off the engine there is none of the suction of the interstate or even the threadlike pull of a secondary highway asphalt always tempts you to go faster but the opposite is true of a gravel road when i get deep enough into the grid of gravel roads in iowa , i can feel the car slowing and slowing until finally i come to a stop across from some farmstead with a particularly fine old hoghouse or along a stretch of fence where three redwinged blackbirds the first i ve seen this year are proclaiming a change of season that was outside the small town of swisher yesterday another redwinged blackbird perched on a fencepost and opened its wings slightly , as if it were sunning itself or simply feeling the lift of the breeze i spent a good part of my childhood driving along such roads with my family , all across northern and central iowa i try to imagine what i must have seen on those trips i do so because the farms i pass are so interesting to me now , and yet they are so much less complex , biologically speaking , than the farms i saw when i was young yesterday , i spent an hour working my way across the gravel grid on my way to the airport south of cedar rapids no one is in the fields yet , of course what cattle i saw only a few were penned in yards or turned out in the stubble close to home i saw a pair of belgian horses and no pigs or chickens at all i also saw no people the farmyards were nearly all immaculate i had the curious feeling that it was the very neatness of those yards that was keeping everyone indoors on a warm , sunny march morning , as if they had been sequestered by a sense of orderliness the redwinged blackbirds had the world to themselves this morning sunny and warm here too lindy and i cleaned the chickenhouses it is an appalling job , universally loathed , almost enough to put you off eggs for a while scraping up the thick plastering of chickenmanure under the roosts , forking up the matted hay on the floor the only thing that makes it tolerable is the thought of how well all this muck and dry matter will compost , and the obvious pleasure the chickens take in the process by the time we were done , bees had begun to stream out of the hive i saw them clustered on the dead blossoms of a birch tree that blew over not long ago

dennis w zilinski ii was the child that so many parents strive to produce , but few actually pull off always punctual , said his mom , marion , a legal secretary he woke each day smiling she raised five children , loves them all the same but there was something about dennis , her fourth a maturity , a purposefulness somehow a grown person was lodged inside him even while he was still a boy at 11 he was volunteering to deliver holiday baskets to the poor the family s pastor at middletown reformed church thought he was joking when , at 14 , he raised his hand to be on the worship committee , which was all adults it was no joke he pushed them to reinstate the sunday sunrise service he said , 'my parents will make everyone breakfast , ' recalled his dad , dennis in school , when his class had to write about a hero , most boys chose ballplayers , but he picked his father , big dennis , a new jersey state trooper for 32 years little dennis grew big 6 feet 1 inch , 200 pounds but was not a natural athlete , and worked to make himself a competitive swimmer , picking the toughest stroke , the butterfly he was on the red bank ymca team , and his parents drove all over the state , sometimes , as his dad said , spending six hours at a meet to watch dennis swim a 30second relay a lot of times , he did n't win , his father said and yet by senior year at christian brothers academy in lincroft , nj , an allboys' catholic school and state swimming power , he was captain he swam to his own beat others played heart of a champion by nelly on their psych tapes he was listening to oh holy night , by neil diamond he was an average student , but none tried harder if they gave him a report due in two weeks , he 'd get his index cards together right away to plan it out , said his mother he was accepted to the united states military academy at west point , and though the swim coach at the time was n't interested in him , by senior year he was team captain raising an idealistic son can make parents fearful he wo n't be shrewd enough to look out for himself in the summer of 2002 , between dennis s sophomore and junior years , his mom and dad made a special visit to west point cadets can quit with no military obligation until the first class of junior year and though the zilinskis loved west point , they asked their son about leaving i said , 'dennis , the country s going to war , ' recalled mrs zilinski , 'you can still drop out' he said , 'you do n't quit when your country needs you most , mom' she urged him to choose a branch of the army like finance or law he picked infantry before deploying , he arranged his life as neatly as those index cards he proposed to his girlfriend , marie cicerelle , a fellow cadet , in central park , and they planned a 2007 wedding , for after their return from iraq in august 2005 , he went to a lawyer to do his will we 're driving there and he asks me , 'how much do you have to leave someone \? ' recalled mrs zilinski i said , 'it s up to you' he said , 'how much would i have to leave the church \? ' i said 'it s very personal if you leave 500 they 'll be thrilled' lt dennis zilinski , 23 , arrived in iraq in early october 2005 his parents emailed and sent letters daily he was so busy , they said , several days could pass with no email messages back they heard from him nov 14 any time you have contact , it erases all those days you heard nothing , his father said you know you 're that much closer to him coming home 'as of today , he s safe' there were no email messages the rest of that week mrs zilinski had a recurring nightmare of a coffin draped in an american flag and that friday night , she woke in a panic while the neighbors along their suburban culdesac slept , she sat at the computer i wrote , 'i know you 're busy , i just need to hear , even a oneliner' mr zilinski checked the defense department web site daily , and on saturday morning , nov 19 , read of five deaths in bayji , iraq , where a roadside bomb blew up a humvee there were no names , but it was the 101st airborne , their son s division i did n't tell marion , said mr zilinski i figured every hour that passes and we do n't hear , the chance is better that we were ok at 11 pm he was showering when his wife came upstairs as soon as she came up , there was no question what happened , he said two officers were at the door dennis had told us , if they 're dressed in bdu s battle dress uniforms it means injured , mr zilinski said if it s class a uniforms , you 're dead unfortunately , they were in class a s , so that was it soldiers write a letter to be mailed in the event they 're killed three weeks after he died , lt zilinski s letter came home mom and dad , he began , if you are reading this letter , then i have paid the ultimate sacrifice for our country he thanked them for a wonderful life , said he enjoyed every single minute of it i love this country , our friends , and most importantly our family he wrote that his spirit would always be with them and he knew they 'd meet again in heaven i do not want your life to be too affected by my loss , he wrote he also enclosed a list of how i want my stuff handed out to everyone this included his 100 , 000 death benefit , which he left to their church my reaction \? said mrs zilinski i said , 'holy smoke , ' only i did n't use the word smoke' if you knew dennis , that said everything about dennis a year has passed and despite their son s wishes , every day is too affected by his loss they hear him in the music at the beautiful white church in middletown about half his gift went to buy a new church organ mrs zilinski s faith remains strong , but mr zilinski says , my faith is still up and down because of what happened they 've attended several ceremonies honoring their son , and sunday morning , nov 12 , is the first annual lt zilinski benefit run at the pnc bank arts center in holmdel for a year their dining room was cluttered with his things the shells from the 21gun salute when he was buried at west point the cd of the memorial service in iraq his medals , and all the cards and letters an idealistic young man s death can generate i could n't go in there , mrs zilinski said i could n't breathe mr zilinski said , you 'd pick up something , read it , look at it , but it could n't go anywhere only in the last week have they got it into boxes you think of him when you wake up and go to bed , mr zilinski said they look for signs of him when the phone rings , and there s no one there , mrs zilinski says , i believe it s a signal from dennis and when mr zilinski runs , he talks to dennis i cry and it clears my mood they support the war and are grateful that even those who do n't seem to support the troops but they are amazed at how disengaged most americans are every day after work , mr zilinski changes his clothes , has dinner with his wife , then goes to the computer i'm consumed by that web site you see six killed , five , one you think of the families i know i'm them a year ago , and i still feel this way think what s in store for them , mrs zilinski said photos on display mementos of lt dennis w zilinski ii s brief military career , in his parents' dining room he was killed in iraq last november \( photo by laura pedrick for the new york times \) \( pg 1 \) mourning a year after their son s death , marion and dennis zilinski have only recently been able to sort through his things \( photo by laura pedrick for the new york times \) \( pg 4 \)

in a week when michael richards s racist rant continues to be news , mark mcgwire s election to baseball s hall of fame seems in doubt , and bill frist leaves both the senate and the race for president , it may be time to reflect on a pattern in american culture that as yet has no name , though it has many instances someone says something or does something or does something by saying something and within a short time it is recognized as a blunder of the first order almost immediately the debate is about whether the offender will ever recover examples are not hard to come by one of the first characterizations of the richards fiasco described him as pulling a mel gibson , already shorthand for outofcontrolcelebrity spews racist venom just before the midterm election , john kerry botched the punch line of a joke , and word went out that he had called soldiers serving in iraq dumb \( he meant to call george bush dumb , but that might have been only marginally less damaging \) by evening the tv pundits had already written him off as a candidate in 2008 , and the next morning don imus asked him to do democrats a favor and stay home until the election was over kerry is an old hand at this kind of thing i voted for it before i voted against it \( or was it the other way around \? it doesn t matter \) , i m john kerry , and i m reporting for duty indeed , kerry is so talented in this vein that he doesn t have to say anything any photo op will do whether it s windsurfing and looking like an eastern liberal dilettante , or wearing hunter s gear and looking like an eastern liberal dilettante trying to look like a regular bluecollar guy , or donning a spacesuit and looking like a huge pillsbury doughboy or the michelin man , the guy can t appear in public without endangering his career of course kerry is not the only politician to put his foot \( and sometimes his whole body \) in his mouth none of his photo ops was quite as disastrous as michael dukakis s turn as a tank driver , complete with helmet and i voted for it before i voted against it has its antecedent in bill clinton s it depends on what the meaning of the word is is both were attempts at sophistication and nuance that came out sounding like evasion and double talk \( i did not have sex with that woman sounded straightforward at first , but when it turned out that in saying it , clinton was parsing the sex act in ways one might call jesuitical , the statement became fodder for parody on latenight tv , where it still resides \) and who can forget who will allow us to forget howard dean s scream \? kerry , then , is continuing a democratic party tradition , but it s not only the democratic party the fact that no one to this day knows quite what macaca means , or whether george allen meant anything at all by it , didn t stop the uttering of the word from derailing his campaign mission accomplished \( or george bush reporting that i ve done my duty \) had a nice ring to it in 2003 , but now it is the bell tolling the demise of the bush presidency and although there are many reasons for the failure of the frist candidacy to catch on how about no identifiable position , no charisma and no constituency , for starters surely one was his diagnosis at long distance of terry schiavo s condition , an act of presumption that seemed even more egregious because he is a physician and then there was mitt romney s father george , whose own presidential ambitions were doomed the moment he explained a change of heart on vietnam by saying \( in 1967 \) that he had been brainwashed presumably , he spelled brainwashed correctly , putting him one up on dan quayle , who will always be remembered as the vice president who couldn t spell potato ok , so republicans do it , democrats do it , superstar actors do it , onehitwonder comedians do it but what , exactly , is it \? well , it comes in more than one variety the constant is the phenomenon of the watershed moment , the equivalent of jumping the shark in politics and public life you re going along just fine , and then you say something or do something and before you know it , you re toast the variety inheres in the kind of thing you say or do and the predictability of the outcry that follows there are the missteps that you would have drawn back from had you the presence of mind to do so surely michael richards and mel gibson wish they could have their moments back again no one could think that in the 21st century venting against jews and blacks would have no consequences and had jesse jackson known that every bit of an interview would reach the light of day , he would have thought twice or more about calling new york hymietown but howard dean could not have known that his expression of enthusiasm and determination \( alan greenspan would have called it irrational exuberance \) would be heard as the sound of someone out of control mark mcgwire could not have known that his refusal to talk about the past at a congressional hearing \( in hindsight , he should have ducked it \) would be heard as an admission of guilt george romney could not have known that by using one metaphor rather than another he could have said i was snowed , and it would have been hard for his opponents to pick up that ball and run with it he was ending his political career al gore could not have known that his claim to have facilitated the creation of the internet would have morphed immediately into the \( risible \) claim to have invented the internet this second category of disasters seen as such only in retrospect , although retrospect may be a matter of seconds is the more interesting because there is no way to anticipate what happens the lead singer of the dixie chicks might have thought that a few people would take it badly when , as a texan , she apologized to the world for giving it george bush but the concerted campaign against her and the group in the country music world probably came as an unwelcome surprise former harvard president larry summers no doubt expected that some people would be put off by his speculation that scientific aptitude might have a gender basis , but he did not imagine months of being roasted over a spit in public and the long , slow march to a resignation you can advise people not to make racist or antisemitic remarks or even to refrain from saying anything about race , religion or gender at all but what advice could you give that would protect someone from a turn of phrase that someone else makes into something never intended \? never say anything that could be misappropriated \? you might as well recommend saying nothing , though even that won t always work , for you can always be faulted by the press or your enemies \( sometimes a distinction without a difference \) for having been silent when there was a moral issue to be faced and pronounced on i suppose you could get out of public life altogether , but domestic life also holds out the possibility of saying something that forever alters your future for the worse think of marriage i guess the only wisdom and it is no help at all was offered long ago in the verse my mother recited to me more times than i can remember the moving finger writes and having writ , moves on nor all your piety nor wit shall lure it back to cancel half a line , nor all your tears wash out a word of it come to think of it , tears themselves can be the writing that time cannot erase or take back , as edmund muskie learned when he cried or appeared to cry again it doesn t matter in new hampshire and left his presidential hopes in the snow
as if we don t have enough problems with muslim and jewish fundamentalists , we are now confronted with yet another ist christian zionists , mostly from the united states , are trying to throw their weight behind one of the parties , in effect calling for the continuation of the war and carnage in lebanon a small minority of evangelical christians have entered the middle east political arena with some of the most unchristian statements i have ever heard the latest gems come from people like pat robertson , the founder and chairman of the christian broadcasting network , and rev john hagee of christians united for israel hagee , a popular televangelist who leads the 18 , 000member cornerstone church in san antonio , ratcheted up his rhetoric this year with the publication of his book , jerusalem countdown , in which he argues that a confrontation with iran is a necessary precondition for armageddon \( which will mean the death of most jews , in his eyes \) and the second coming of christ in the bestselling book , hagee insists that the united states must join israel in a preemptive military strike against iran to fulfill god s plan for both israel and the west shortly after the book s publication , he launched christians united for israel \( cufi \) , which , as the christian version of the powerful american israel public affairs committee , he said would cause a political earthquake with the outbreak of the war on lebanon , he and others have called to their followers to pray for israel , and for the continuation of the war on lebanon they have demanded that israel not relent in what they call the need to destroy hezbollah and hamas they seem to have completely forgotten the very core of the christian faith i have been watching many american evangelicals trying to distance themselves from the calls in the name of the almighty for the war to continue as christian leaders of all persuasions , including leaders of evangelical churches , are calling for mideast peace and an immediate ceasefire , these christian zionists want their followers to pray only for israel one email message that was making the rounds came from a prominent us evangelical christian totally upset with an interview that pat robertson gave to the jerusalem post in it , robertson appears more proisraeli than the israelis themselves and expresses anger at the notion that israelis might not completely finish off hezbollah a task that he somehow sees as god s will the author of the abovementioned email message , serge duss of world vision , a christian relief organization , called the robertson interview a perversion of the gospel of jesus duss writes that he is sure that many evangelicals strongly disagree and would gladly refute robertson s distorted theology duss insists that american evangelicals are praying for 1 \) the people of israel and lebanon 2 \) for a ceasefire , so that lives will be spared and 3 \) for peace with justice for all people in the middle east the discussion has reminded me of so many calls i heard as a young christian boy growing up in bethlehem and jerusalem the false prophets that have predicted the end days and the presence of the antichrist are too numerous to list here but i vividly remember the very same pat robertson in 1982 as he spoke on cbn s 700 club he stood in front of a map of the middle east , opened up a copy of the old testamant and claimed to know what a particular prophecy meant in geopolitical terms as the beginsharon army at the time was besieging beirut , he pointed out exactly what he said would happen next in particular he was keen to repeat that the plo s leader at the time , yasir arafat , was none other than the antichrist himself less than 13 years after that international broadcast , robertson was filmed visiting arafat in gaza , delivering food and milk to palestinians and applauding the peace agreement that arafat had signed with israel s yitzhak rabin christian zionists who use religious rhetoric to justify political and military actions are no better than jewish or islamic fundamentalists who make similar outlandish claims peace in the middle east should be about the liberty , independence and freedoms of all the people of the region , and not about whose promised land the holy land is for the time being , i , as a christian palestinian , prefer to follow the words of jesus in his sermon on the mount blessed are the peacemakers for they will be called the sons of god
san jose , calif patrick k tillman stood outside his law office here , staring intently at a yellow house across the street , just over 70 yards away that , he recalled , is how far away his eldest son , pat , who gave up a successful nfl career to become an army ranger , was standing from his fellow rangers when they shot him dead in afghanistan almost two years ago i could hit that house with a rock , mr tillman said you can see every last detail on that place , everything , and you 're telling me they could n't see pat \? mr tillman , 51 , is a grieving father who has refused to give up on his son while fiercely shunning the public spotlight that has followed cpl pat tillman s death , mr tillman has spent untold hours considering the army s measurements , like the 70 yards he has drafted long , sometimes raw , letters to military leaders , demanding answers about the shooting and he has studied and challenged army powerpoint presentations meant to explain how his son , who had called out his own name and waved his arms , wound up dead anyway , shot three times in the head by his own unit , which said it had mistaken him for the enemy all i asked for is what happened to my son , and it has been lie after lie after lie , said mr tillman , explaining that he believed the matter should remain between me and the military but that he had grown too troubled to keep silent as the second anniversary of the death of corporal tillman , once a popular safety for the arizona cardinals , approaches , mr tillman , his former wife , mary , and other family members remain frustrated by the army s handling of the killing but for the first time may be close to getting some of the answers they so desperately seek after repeated complaints from the tillmans and members of congress contacted by them , the army is immersed in a highly unusual criminal investigation of the killing , and the defense department s inspector general , which called for the criminal investigation this month , is looking separately into the army s conduct in its aftermath senior military officials said defense secretary donald h rumsfeld had expressed outrage to top aides that the army was having to conduct yet another inquiry into the shooting , prolonging the family s anguish and underscoring the failure of the army s investigative processes to bring resolution gary comerford , a spokesman for the inspector general , said the army criminal investigation command was dealing with events leading up to the death , and we 're looking at anything after that though mr comerford did not say so , that could include the possibility of a coverup , the tillmans said they had been told by the inspector general s office no one wants answers more than the tillmans but by now , they said , they have lost patience and faith that any army entity , even the criminal investigation command , can be trusted to find the truth i am sitting here on my own , going over and over and over this for two years , ms tillman , 50 , said in a telephone interview the whole thing is such a debacle i am beyond tears it s killing me like her former husband , she has spent days reading the files , researching the episode , calling members of congress , even trying to contact some of the soldiers involved she criticized the military , as well as the news media , for failing to get to the bottom of what occurred , leaving her family , in essence , to figure it out themselves all of it , her former husband said , has even left him suspicious of the military s central finding in their son s case so far that the killing was a terrible but unintentional accident there is so much nonstandard conduct , both before and after pat was killed , that you have to start to wonder , mr tillman said how much effort would you put into hiding an accident \? why do you need to hide an accident \?
math quiz so far this season , broadway attendance is up 4 percent from the same period last year total boxoffice receipts for the season are up 12 percent you will notice a discrepancy here explain there are several reasons of course , like a few hit musicals and a movie star or two on exhibition but a large part of the answer can be attributed to one factor premium tickets premium tickets , those eighthrow center seats going for 300 the day of the performance , have their origins in october 2001 , when the producers of the producers unveiled the now legendary 480 ticket it came about , said richard frankel , one of the producers behind the idea , because for years ticket brokers and scalpers had been charging hundreds of dollars for the best seats , a lucrative tradition that continues to flourish on the internet if people were willing to pay so much for good seats , he explained , then it was only fair that the investors , producers and the creative team behind the production should be the ones making the money boy , did they scream , he said but the prevalence of premium tickets has since been growing and now , four and a half years later , almost everybody is doing it as a result people who thought that 200 was enough for a pair of saturdaynight centerorchestra tickets to a hit musical can be shut out for months and months the 200plus ticket has become so common that not only are broadway s most popular shows , like three days of rain and the odd couple , selling seats for more than twice the regular top ticket price of 100 , but so are shows that are usually barely half full , like well and barefoot in the park the box office for well , which has been playing on most nights to a house that is twothirds empty , for example , is selling tickets for 20125 according to elizabeth i mccann , one of that show s producers , well , which began previews in midmarch , has sold about 64 premium tickets so far for the season s soldout hits , like three days of rain \( with julia roberts \) and the odd couple \( with nathan lane and matthew broderick \) , the sale of premium tickets has contributed to a new form of broadway math , first spotted with the producers for these shows the average ticket price has repeatedly surpassed 100 , the top nonpremium ticket at the shows' box offices at three days the average ticket price is regularly 12 or 13 above the 10125 orchestra seat at the odd couple , the average price also has been a few dollars above the top orchestra seat price earlier this spring at those two shows the premium ticket price is around 250 granted , there is an asterisk here these shows are limited engagements and need to earn back their investments much more quickly than a show with an openended run but premium seats are now a part of almost every broadway show s seating plan from the start one of the first phone calls you have is , 'how many seats should we set aside for premium seats \? ' ms mccann said for openended runs the number of premium seats reserved in the orchestra can be as high as 200 a performance for the most popular shows on the biggest weekends , to almost none on slow wednesday afternoons who buys these tickets \? those in the industry rattle off a list people who want great seats at the last minute , people who have expense accounts , people who are not regular theatergoers and consider a show a special occasion and , that loveliest of all breeds , people for whom paying a high price is a pleasure in itself about a month ago mark mcelreath , a lawyer in manhattan , had a client coming into town who , two days before his arrival , insisted on seeing barefoot in the park mr mcelreath is a frequent theatergoer , but had never considered buying premium tickets now he had a deadline and an expense account when you 're looking on the internet , mr mcelreath said , as soon as you hit that button , the world opens up you can see all the great seats are held in reserve that is exactly how premium tickets work , according to those involved in several productions for smaller shows like barefoot in the park and well , the number of reserved premium seats for a performance can range from a dozen to about 40 for popular musicals like spamalot , the phantom of the opera and wicked , there are frequently 100 or more seats in the orchestra set aside for premium tickets , and prices can run from 175 to 300 typically , a week before the performance , half the premium seats remaining are released back into the nonpremium pool two days before , the number is halved again , and again on the day of the show that is the typical model , but now that broadway is using the kind of market analysis long a part of other consumer businesses , the system is extremely flexible every week we analyze the numbers , where people bought tickets and at what price , said nancy coyne , a founder of the theatrical marketing firm serino coyne these data , along with knowledge about conventions , holidays and hotel occupancy , determines how many seats to set aside for a given performance , she said
we have at least reason to fear that we may be degenerate possibly we are all drifting , tending to the condition of intellectual barnacles thus worried edwin ray lankester \( we ve met this evolutionary biologist before \) in 1880 today i want to ask that question in modern terms relaxed natural selection , as i explained yesterday , is the idea that when life gets easier and more comfortable when it is easier to survive and reproduce any genes that no longer give you a competitive edge will start to decay so has natural selection on humans become relaxed \? in other words , are many of us still dying young , or failing to reproduce , because of the genes we carry \? or have we escaped from nature s ghastly tyranny only to doom ourselves to a kind of genetic rot \? this question has exercised geneticists ever since there were any \( note that anxiety about mutational decay is different from the arguments that underpinned the infamous eugenics movements of the first half of the 20th century those arguments , based in some peoples minds on bogus notions of racial purity , were about whether the human gene pool was going to deteriorate owing to the supposed failure of the right people to have more children \) the specter that mutational decay holds up is that , as the generations march by , we will become increasingly dependent on medicine to correct problems of one sort or another one of my doctoral supervisors , the late w d hamilton , was an alarmist on this score we doom ourselves , in fact , to watch the beginning of a great oppression in which each of our lines becomes gradually enslaved to a total dependence on medicine through its physical and mental incompetence others have been more moderate , but still concerned in 1997 , jim crow , a great population geneticist , wrote how many headaches , stomach upsets , depressed periods , and such things that make life less pleasant , but don t reduce viability or fertility , would be eliminated if our mutation rate had been lower \? i suspect the number is substantial i do regard mutation accumulation as a problem it is something like the population bomb , but it has a much longer fuse do we really face a problem \? and if we do , is it universal , or something specific to the luxurious and decadent west , where famine and infectious disease are now rare \? if it is a problem , how soon will we start to notice \? the short answer is that no one knows the answer to any of these questions today , i want to explore this treacherous terrain a preliminary glance at the situation suggests that , indeed , natural selection doesn t matter much anymore there are three independent lines of reasoning the first is that the human population is growing fast this suggests a smaller proportion of people are dying before they are old enough to have children indeed , in the rich world , it is now rare and rather shocking for a parent to bury a child even as recently as 150 years ago , that was a commonplace the second is that , in the west at least , differences in family size have shrunk dramatically most people have only a couple of children \( in many parts of china , people are obliged by law to have only one child \) as differences in family sizes fall , natural selection becomes less efficient when everyone has the same number of children , it stops completely the third line of reasoning is the suspicion that we have relaxed natural selection on a huge array of traits , from the trivial , such as how many teeth we have and our ability to smell well , to the profound , such as getting born , or being fertile in former times , birth was a challenge babies that were too big killed their mothers these days , however , caesarean sections allow big babies to bounce into the world regardless of their mother s pelvic width even more startling , the new techniques of assisted reproduction mean that people whose genes make them sterile can have children men who , because of their genes , can t conceive a child the oldfashioned way can now produce heirs , for example \( at least , they can if they have access to western medicine this is still a tiny elite \) against that , there is plenty of evidence that natural selection is still an important force look no further than the millions killed by hiv and the survival of those lucky enough to possess genes that confer resistance malaria kills more than a million children every year , most of them in africa again , some genes confer resistance indeed , one death in three in the world is due to infectious disease in some parts of africa , life expectancy for a child born today is less than 35 years relaxed selection , insofar as it occurs at all , does not appear to be a global problem recent analyses of the patterns of variation within human genes reinforce the view that natural selection is actively shaping us or certainly has done so up to now moreover , at least some of the problems that initially appear to be due to relaxed selection the various minor ailments in richer countries are due not to an accumulation of mutations , but to an unfortunate mismatch between genes and environment some evidence suggests that the surge in the number of people who need glasses is a consequence of sugary diets during infancy , for example richer diets have also made us much bigger and taller knee problems and back problems are in part a consequence caesarean sections are , too at least some csections are due to babies being big because their mothers eat well , not because they have bigness genes it s not just minor ailments , either some serious birth defects are due to environment , not genes just look at the birth defects caused by thalidomide and at least some breast cancers can be attributed to the long gap in many western women s lives between reaching puberty and having their first child to sum up at the moment , there are grounds to suppose that natural selection , insofar as it has relaxed at all , is relaxed only on the coddled few but let s imagine that it does relax completely what then \? even under relaxed selection , genetic decay is not always inevitable a couple of processes can potentially counter its effects first , there s sexual selection broadly speaking , the ability to find and seduce a mate in other animals , we tend to think that this ability is proof in and of itself that an animal carries few mutations suppose , therefore , that a lot of people don t have any children suppose that one reason the birthrate has fallen in the rich world is not just that women have fewer children , but that more people have none at all if nokidders are so because they carry lots of mutations and cannot find \( or do not seek \) a mate , this could offset the effects of relaxed selection a second force that might offset relaxed selection is death before birth in a large proportion of pregnancies , women suffer a spontaneous abortion early on understanding exactly why this happens isn t easy , since at least some happen before the woman knows she is pregnant however , it s thought that many of these miscarriages are a result of genetic problems of one sort or another in the fetus perhaps many mutations get removed at this stage it may be that this early action of natural selection could prevent \( or at least substantially slow \) genetic decay , even if natural selection after birth were to vanish but we don t know hamilton thought that genetic decay and the attendant decline in health would become apparent in the west within the next hundred years crow allowed 50 to 100 generations hamilton advocated stopping it by returning to natural selection crow , a technological fix to somehow stop mutations i m with crow natural selection means standing by while people suffer and die we should abolish it if we can i ll be back next week with my last series the subject \? that s a surprise

now that we have survived another earth day the annual attempt to heal the planet by making its human inhabitants feel worse i have a short quiz to cheer you up 1 \) in most places in the united states , is the air dirtier than it was two decades ago \? 2 \) has the amount of forest land in america been shrinking \? 3 \) to combat global warming , which country is leading new international efforts to reduce annual emissions of greenhouse gases by a greater amount than the kyoto protocol \? if you correctly answered no to the first two questions , you 're doing better than the environmental studies class i surveyed during its recent field trip to the american museum of natural history in new york none of those highschool students nor their teacher got both questions right most got them both wrong most air pollutants have declined sharply in recent decades , and the amount of forest land has n't been shrinking at all it s been fairly stable since 1920 and has actually grown in the last decade but cheery facts like these do n't get much attention in environmental studies classes or earth day events earth day has traditionally been the occasion for apocalyptic predictions global famines due to overpopulation , cancer epidemics from synthetic chemicals , cities destroyed by accidents at nuclear plants , species wiped out by deforestation , crippling shortages of energy humans , especially americans with their technological hubris , were doomed to be punished unless they forsook gasguzzlers , turned off the lights and toiled in their organic gardens complete , of course , with compost heaps the current apocalypse , global warming , is a more realistic danger than the previous ones but after all the past doomsdays that did n't arrive , a lot of people are understandably skeptical of the ecoprophets , especially when the prophets start prescribing the same old penance the kyoto protocol appealed to environmentalists' sense of virtue because it required big sacrifices , particularly from americans one reason the united states dropped out is that it could n't get proper credit for the new growth in its forests while the growing trees would indeed remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere , this solution lacked the requisite dose of masochism but even the proponents of sacrifice have a hard time keeping their promises europeans are having trouble cutting their emissions to meet kyoto targets in america , president bush is blamed by democrats for rejecting kyoto , but how many of the democrats now howling about high gasoline prices would vote for the best way to comply with it a stiff tax on gasoline , coal and other fuels \? the most practical way to combat global warming is not through asceticism but through technology the way we averted the famines and energy shortages forecast on past earth days air pollution has declined not because americans drive less and turn off lights but because cars and power plants have become cleaner while europeans have been reveling in their moral superiority in adopting the kyoto protocol , the united states has been pushing technologies that involve less pain but more gain , like new nuclear power plants and methods of sequestering carbon america has offered to help india build nuclear plants and is working in china to generate cleaner electricity it s leading a 15nation program to cut down emissions of methane , a powerful greenhouse gas , by turning it into a profitable source of energy these programs have gotten little attention \( i managed to find a total of one newspaper article devoted to the methane project \) but if you add up the projected annual reductions in carbon dioxide from these efforts , the total is greater than what europeans are planning to cut through kyoto , according to david victor , the director of the program on energy and sustainable development at stanford the bush administration s nuclear deal with india by itself could do almost as much as kyoto , victor says while we should cut our own emissions at home , we need to work on more deals like this in developing countries , because they 'll be producing most of the future carbon dioxide and they do n't want to address global warming unless it serves their own needs it s fine to exhort rich westerners to live frugally , but people in poor countries will not be swayed by appeals to asceticism when you live without a car or electricity or running water , every day is earth day
once upon a time an investigation into a shady arkansas land deal led to the impeachment of a president on grounds that had little do with real estate today an investigation into the shady disclosure of a cia officer s name has led to calls for impeachment of a president on grounds that have little to do with the identity leak ok , it s obvious that monica lewinsky was far more tangential to whitewater than valerie plame wilson is to the news that the white house may have leaked classified material to discredit critics , including her husband , ambassador joseph wilson  but one must also consider the limits of the muchhyped news coming out of lewis scooter libby s grand jury testimony mr libby did not assert in his testimony to a grand jury , first reported on the web site of the new york sun , that mr bush or mr cheney had authorized him to reveal the name of an undercover cia officer , valerie wilson or , as cnn national security expert david ensor put it it s not about a law being broken here , and it s not about valerie plamewilson s name but it does show us the first evidence that the president himself wanted some of this information put out in the media so where does this leave us \? in a constitutional crisis , according to the nation , tpm cafe s larry johnson and think progress exactly where we were , according to power line , just one minute and author blogger austin bay  fortunately , a few people in opinionland are finding less reflexive ways of looking at the news one is laura rozen at war and piece , who argues that the revelations put senate intelligence committee chairman pat roberts on the hot seat as the administration is exposed as having orchestrated a leaking conspiracy and then a cover up surrounding just the prewar intel manipulations roberts has not only so far failed to investigate but repeatedly denied existed , roberts is left holding the cover up bag and looking increasingly ridiculous , and worse his foresaken sic duty is to provide comprehensive intelligence oversight for the people , not to conspire in a cover up to protect the executive and , as we have learned the white house directed , blame all the iraq war mistakes on the intelligence community , in order to insulate the president roberts has truly failed his nation roberts for some reason is sensitive to press criticism perhaps as has been suggested to me , he is being misled by his staff and is insulated to some degree from some of these realities himself and his response to the editorials that will bash him is likely to be to rush out the completed parts of his phase ii report \( if you can call more than three years after the invasion a rush \) you can bet that , when they finally do appear , none of them will , by careful design , get to the heart of the matter that the fitzgerald investigation has exposed in national review , james s robbins says that the bushies were in the right to declassify material to counter their critics , but he questions their tactics the administration s error , if anything , was using press leaks to distribute the information leaks , while a way of life in washington , are still disreputable rather than fighting the battle through favored intermediaries , an opinion piece written by , for example , the vice president , or a highprofile press release would have been more effective perhaps they felt that responding directly would have unduly raised wilson s profile to andrew sullivan , neither motive nor method seem to make sense  cheney s judgment in this matter is extremely odd who really cared about joseph wilson s oped \? why the extreme defensiveness and then recklessness of the plame leak \? we re either talking extreme hubris here , or someone who felt he had a lot to hide or an admixture of the two and the anonymous liberal parses libby s statements and finds that many of the dots don t seem to connect \( warning , dear readers , you may need a scorecard to keep the players straight \) were these prewar leaks authorized by the president as well , or just cheney \? if by the president , why did libby describe the nie incident as unique in his recollection \? if these leaks were authorized by cheney alone , did cheney break the law \? and if libby acted solely on the vice president s authority for these prewar leaks , why was he suddenly unwilling to do so with respect the nie \? what changed \? according to libby s testimony , he advised cheney that he could not discuss the nie with reporters because it was classified then , even after cheney got specific authorization from the president , libby felt compelled to seek legal advice from david addington before leaking the information does that make any sense \? so let s assume , for the moment , that libby s testimony is accurate that would mean that the president , instead of following normal declassification procedures and publicly releasing a redacted version of the nie , authorized an aide to present a cherrypicked and manipulated version of that document to a friendly new york times reporter on deep background that aide then passed along the highly misleading information and asked that it be attributed to a former hill staffer that may not be illegal , but it is sure as hell unethical so , i ll ask again , where does all this leave us \? well , one thing s for sure we aren t in arkansas anymore tobin harshaw
all the action from the second semifinal as recounted by victor mather final it s all over and the veteran bleus will play italy in the final on sunday ! an early penalty followed by 60 minutes of dogged defense won it for france portugal can t be too aggrieved deco , pauleta and maniche had little to offer offensively and chances were few that s it for me it s been a pleasure bringing you the action over the past month please join jeff for the final and whoever draws the short straw for the thrilling thirdplace game until south africa in 2010 ! victor 95 france moves the ball upfield to kill the game , but it s stolen ! and ronaldo breaks for goal offside ! 94 last gasps now from portugal they ve earned a corner deco it pings around a bit and is cleared for another corner which is headed away 93 a longball leads to a shot from meira , but he rockets it into row z 92 still nothing from portugal 90 france is methodically killing off the game four minutes will be added 88 saha and carvalho will now miss the final thirdplace game 87 saha picks up a yellow after just a minute on the pitch he slid recklessly into figo 86 france kills some valuable minutes passing the ball around fluently 85 france s first counterattack in a while ends with a poor sagnol shot and a sub henry out , saha in 83 first yellow of the game to carvalho of portugal for a foul on wiltord a refreshing contrast to all the cardfests 81 dangerous free kick for figo headed away portugal is pressing hard they have less than 10 minutes ! 79 there s coupet on the bench again he mimes barthez s awkward save boy , he looks grumpy 77 chance ! ronaldo falls again , this time earning a free kick he takes it himself and barthez gets his arms to it , but wallops it straight into the air figo is there for the header just over ! 76 nuno valente does very well to get a low cross into the box then , hilariously , both ronaldo and postiga hit the deck simultaneously no whistle 75 last portugal sub postiga for costinha that s an attacker for a midfielder , which is good , but it leaves them no more bullets for a potential overtime also , france has subbed govou on for young ribery they have one left 74 simao gets off a nice cross ronaldo seems to have taken over pauleta s role of fruitlessly chasing passes in the box 71 nuno valente tries a long looping shot barthez has to leap , but he catches it the camera catches french backup keeper coupet on the sidelines he looks annoyed , perhaps still brooding about being passed over for the top job let it go , gregory 69 france sub wiltord in for malouda 67 that s it for pauleta portugal subs in simao sabrosa of benfica 66 another long pass fails to find pauleta he looks pained shortly after , he goes down very easily after a touch from gallas it was outside the penalty area though , and there s no call anyway 64 we finally resume play 63 now france s abidal is down miguel is walking about on the sidelines but it looks like he s going to be subbed by paulo ferreira 59 miguel makes a nice run , beats a few men , then feeds pauleta in the area pauleta whips it back to him but miguel has fallen down hurt there s no foul i didn t see him collide obviously with anyone 55 france get a threeman break ribery on the wing finds zidane , but his pass to henry is far off 53 famed german boris becker is in the stands enjoying the action actually , he looks a little bored 52 pauleta gets a rare shot , but it hits the side netting nearly all of portugal s moves have gone through ronaldo and or figo pauleta and deco have been relatively anonymous 49 france begins a slow buildup , then ribery unexpectedly spins and fires from the half moon ricardo saves , but it was a good thought 48 henry on the counterattack ! he eludes some defenders , notably meira , and ricardo fumbles his shot , but it spins just wide of the goal chances like that should be there for the french if they take them second half kickoff there were 16 fouls in the first half , 10 committed by portugal no cards from senor larrionda though halftime television question in order to be on univision are you required to be either a stunningly beautiful woman or an overweight comic man \? halftime timewaster today s venue is very cool check it out here and here  note the way the entire stadium lights up in different colors depending on who is playing halftime the teams were evenly matched this half france got the penalty when it needed it and that was the difference we should have an entertaining second half as portugal presses for an equalizer 46 another dizzying run by ronaldo ends with a blocked shot and a halfhearted appeal for handball 43 france regains the initiative , winning a series of free kicks in the portugal half none are close enough to go for goal though 39 another ronaldo run ends with a partially deflected shot that wins a corner 37 a cross by figo is too long , but sagnol collides with ronaldo in the box the portuguese bench jumps up and down in anger they wanted a penalty of their own 36 portugal presses forward immediately maniche tries another long shot , but is saved 33 zidane to take goal ! france 1 portugal 0 zidane went left and ricardo guessed correctly , but the penalty was perfectly placed and there was no way for him to reach it 32 penalty ! france can go ahead here ! henry is pulled down in the area by ricardo carvalho carvalho seemed to slip while going for a tackle as henry jinked away there was definitely contact , but did henry also sell his fall a bit \? 30 cristiano ronaldo goes flying after passing by abidal coach domenech of france looks incredulous and makes a twohanded diving gesture when you think of ronaldo you think of fancy stepovers and skillful play it would be a shame if this cup adds flamboyant diver and sideline winker to his reputation 28 ribery finds henry at the endline he turns defender miguel inside out , gets clear , and elects to shoot , but the angle is very tight and he s saved 25 pauleta s cross is too high for ronaldo in the box ronaldo makes a face , but he was well marked 23 vieira and abidal are doing much of the defending on the dangerous cristiano ronaldo 22 henry , playing as france s lone man up front , beats two defenders off the dribble , then shoots , but there s a third defender there to block it it s going to be tough for henry to score from open play in this formation 20 ronaldo is being jeered by the french fans every time he touches the ball 17 long tame shot by figo is easily saved by barthez figo goes down and stays down then he s stretchered off he apparently collided with vieira now he s up and back on much ado about nnothing 16 first corner for portugal figo takes and it s headed away will one of the veteran captains figo and zidane provide the moment of magic that wins today s game \? 14 several nice french passes culminate with a cross by abidal that goes just barely in front of the onrushing henry close 12 figo gets loose but boots the ball out of bounds he raises his hand in appeal , but it s not clear what his beef is 10 more portugal figo sends in a dangerous cross , which thuram clears with a nice slide 9 maniche tries a bomb from distance after a clever backheel by ronaldo it actually doesn t miss by much ! 8 first corner is taken by zidane easily cleared 7 a fast pace so far both teams are racing up and down the pitch 4 another ronaldo run followed by a pass to deco at the halfcircle barthez can only tip it away and pauleta races in with the goal at his mercy but defender sagnol just gets there first 2 ronaldo goes on one of his speedy runs down the left , but vieira catches him and strips him ronaldo takes a flying tumble 1 malouda is released by a longball and has an early chance ! but his shot goes wide kickoff ! 2 57 once again , la marseillaise wins the anthem sweepstakes death to the aristos ! the french players look particularly serious the camera lingers on the distinctive face of franck ribery he looks like he s in a trance 2 54 figo and zidane lead out the teams but first the fifa flag ! 2 52 the teams are in the tunnel a trip to the world cup final could be only 90 \( or 120 \) minutes away zidane finds time to smile at his little mascot 2 48 pm eastern the stadium is rocking with firedup fans but could they be any more stoked than the crowd at the sports club portugues in newark \? that s where jeff and rob will be following the action we ll post some pictures later welcome to the new york times coverage of the world cup today , france faces portugal in munich for the right to advance to the final against italy what is the most pressurepacked situation in sports \?

art howe lives in houston , whose wildcard astros won the national league pennant last season , and he grew up in pittsburgh , whose wildcard steelers won the super bowl on sunday to a large degree , howe said , discussing the playoff success of wildcard teams , i think they have less pressure on them when they get into the postseason because no one expects them to go far , and they have a chip on their shoulder so they play harder howe managed a wildcard team , oakland , into the playoffs in 2001 , but he does n't manage anyone now he does n't have any kind of job in baseball instead he will get by on the money the mets owe him from the last year of his fouryear , 94 million contract hopefully something will happen during the season , howe said in a telephone interview yesterday from his home , where he celebrated the victory of my steelers howe said he might have had a job as someone s bench coach , but ron washington , a coach under howe in oakland , did n't get the managing job in florida , and howe s friend john mclaren missed out on the jobs with the los angeles dodgers and the tampa bay devil rays before the mets , howe managed the astros for five years and the athletics for seven years the end of his tenure was described in nonetooflattering terms in the book moneyball describing the frustration of general manager billy beane after the athletics' 2002 playoff loss to the clearly inferior minnesota twins , the book s author , michael lewis , wrote that at such times , beane would make a trade but there was no player on whom his mind naturally fixed , lewis wrote the only person in the organization whose riddance would make him happier was his manager , art howe it was n't long before he had a novel idea trade art i read that passage , howe said , adding that he did n't care for other passages , as well but , he added there was a time i was going back to oakland , when lou piniella was in the mets' picture at one point , i withdrew my name from the mets i was going to go back to oakland , and billy said he was happy about that moneyball extolled the talents of beane , portraying him as superior to other teams' general managers lewis celebrated beane for his ability to produce winning teams with small payrolls , but terry ryan has done the same thing with the twins , a fact lewis did n't acknowledge as little as beane might have thought of howe , the athletics reached the playoffs three straight seasons under him they have not been there the past two years with ken macha as their manager after making it in his first year it has been three years since the publication of moneyball , and it is worth assessing other matters the book discusses several times , lewis wrote about the athletics' infatuation with kevin youkilis , a young player who had a high onbase percentage , the gold standard of beane s player evaluation in limited playing time with boston the past two seasons , youkilis has compiled a 376 onbase percentage but has yet to show the red sox he is ready to help them on a daily basis they are planning to try youkilis , a converted third baseman , as a platooned first baseman this year jeremy brown , an overweight college catcher but a high oakland draft choice in 2002 because of his high onbase percentage a beane type of pick but he is still working his way through the minors at 26 , having spent the past three seasons at midland , tex , in the class aa texas league scott hatteberg was another onbase guy beane found attractive but after four seasons and last year s oaklandlow 334 onbase percentage by hatteberg , beane cut him loose as a free agent two beane disciples became general managers with other teams , paul depodesta with the dodgers and j p ricciardi with the toronto blue jays moneyball credited depodesta with great statistical dexterity , but it did n't help him with the dodgers , who fired him two years into a fiveyear contract after some highly questionable moves a year ago left them with a weakened team that won 22 fewer games than their divisionwinning team won the year before ricciardi has fared better from an employment standpoint but has n't finished first in four years in fact , he has n't quite done what lewis quoted him as telling the blue jays' president , paul godfrey , he would do you are spending too much money , ricciardi was quoted as saying to godfrey when ricciardi interviewed with toronto i can make you cheaper and better it 'll take a couple of months to make you cheaper and a couple of years to make you better but you 'll be a lot better godfrey liked what he heard , but four years later , the blue jays achieved the same 8082 record they had the year before ricciardi arrived , and that performance followed a far worse season \( 6794 \) as for cheaper , the blue jays' payroll last season was 46 million , down from 65 million the year before ricciardi took over but this year , ricciardi is operating on a budget 25 million higher , which means the blue jays wo n't be cheaper than they were when he interviewed with godfrey photos athletics general manager billy beane , above , has been praised for building competitive teams with a

the death of coretta scott king brings a certain aspect of the 1960 s to nearclosure there were four widows of assassinated public figures of major renown at that time jacqueline kennedy , wife of president john kennedy betty shabazz , wife of nation of islam minister malcolm x ethel kennedy , wife of slain senator robert kennedy and of course mrs king , wife of martin luther king , jr only ethel kennedy is still alive , and she is not a significant public presence of all these women , only mrs king worked tirelessly to advance her husband s name and his cause indeed , of all of them , mrs king became the national widow , a woman who could not have remarried if she wanted the public standing to do what she proceeded to do coretta scott king made being the widow of dr king a political and cultural position she used her famous husband , as certain driven women have done before her , to empower herself and , ironically , achieve her identity through the maintenance and propagation of his myth that she as a black woman was able to build a national shrine for a black man one whom many believed was a communist and fewer truly esteem than their public pronouncements might suggest is a considerable feat of energetic singlemindedness , worthy of admiration skeptics might think it was all a form of marital neurosis a scoresettling obsession with the only thing you ve got that is , mrs king s pursuit was , in part , settling scores with dr king himself \( his womanizing had to be painful and humiliating for any wife , no matter how liberal or forwardthinking she saw herself or how grand the cause of civil rights \) and settling scores with his critics and it should be remembered that at the time of his death , dr king had critics by the bunch it must have been difficult to be married to martin luther king he was never home mrs king had to bear the burden of rearing their four children virtually alone she also had to bear the burden of being a model wife to a man struggling to maintain a triple identity he was a preacher \( being a preacher s wife by itself is enough to make many women seek psychiatric help , so demanding is the job \) he was an international public figure , and he was a constrained black man whose bourgeois morality was crucial to his legitimacy and authority dr king also had to be a model of humility and selflessness in a way few race leaders have been required to be he could not in any way seem to profit from his fame and position any move of that sort , given the intense fbi scrutiny he was under , would have resulted in his complete downfall and the destruction of the civil rights movement so , for instance , he had to give away his nobel peace prize money he left his family very little money when he died in at canaan s edge , the final volume of his study of the king years , taylor branch writes settlement was imminent in april 1965 on coretta s quest for them to buy a first home in atlanta after five years as renters , but king still resisted to him , even a modest house of 10 , 000 was a haunting luxury , unbecoming his commitment to the poor his renunciations of material comfort and bourgeois ambition vexed coretta , especially since his constant journeys most often left her behind with four children in a cramped space she accommodated what she called the guiltridden barbs of a man whose conscience fairly devoured him dr king s guilt was intensified by his philandering he had many women on the road , the privilege of a male celebrity who needs lots of sex to boost his ego and calm his nerves \( it was a standard perk for bigtime black preachers , in any case \) indeed , according to his biographers , he was about to tell mrs king before he died that one mistress had become a favorite and that they ought to divorce \( if the biographies are accurate , it seems unlikely their marriage would have survived into the 1970 s , had dr king not been assassinated \) dr king was also under enormous pressure , as mrs king acknowledges from the outset in her book , my life with martin luther king , jr he was the head of a mass movement that he had virtually come to symbolize and without him could hardly exist as something coherent he also felt pressure because he was a man trying to create a political center and keep himself there , neither too far left nor too conservative he tried to combine the political tactics of the union organizer with the drama and aura of billy grahamstyle religious campaigns , an enormous strategic and ideological strain he was also under the constant threat of death , as were members of his family dr king suffered breakdowns , bouts of exhaustion , as they were called but mrs king must have suffered similarly dr king was surely driven by guilt , as a good many social crusaders are , at least religious ones guilt that motivates them to change society , guilt about why they are driven to do this at some cost to their personal lives , and guilt that arises from how they are supposed to exploit whatever success they achieve all of this adds up to 15 years of a difficult and complex marriage between two ambitious people who were first generation members of the postworld war ii black educated elite therein lies an interesting story of how these ambitions complemented , and how they may have thwarted , particular desires the fathers of mrs and dr king came from large families , but both coretta and martin were born and reared in small southern families , a sign of upward expectations on the part of their parents only people reared in a certain way , with certain important aspirations , would wind up with the idea that they could change the country and that they ought to mrs king graduated from antioch college and the new england conservatory dr king from morehouse , crozer theological seminary and boston university it is little wonder they became the leading couple of civil rights movement in them and through them , the torch of black national leadership was literally passed to a new generation mrs king achieved three institutional changes during her life after her husband s death the establishment of the martin luther king center for nonviolent social change in atlanta the establishment of the national king holiday , signed into law in 1983 by president ronald reagan , a conservative who suspected king was a communist and the establishment of the coretta scott king award for children s books  for these successes she deserves considerable acclaim in her own right as one of the remarkable women of her time she became dr king s paul , in effect she not only institutionalized his beliefs and ideas , spread his influence directly and indirectly in a number of spheres , particularly among young people she also firmly established both his myth and the inviolability of it and she slew his enemies as well , for his canonization , through his holiday , has so elevated him that he transcends criticism even conservatives dare not speak against him , and most have come to accept him as a civic hero , a genuine american founding father , the man who had race relations sorted out the right way before black power , government spending , affirmative action and irresponsible race hustlers came along to wreck the dream , that beautiful articulation of a colorblind america such elevation had not happened for any black leader before dr king not web dubois , frederick douglass , a philip randolph , thurgood marshall , adam clayton powell , marcus garvey , booker t washington , mary church terrell , mary mcleod bethune , lester granger , charles s johnson or anyone else some of these leaders may have left some kind of an institutional presence behind , but none has had dr king s reach , prestige or power of course , dr king was probably the most famous and important leader black america ever produced , but what has happened subsequent to his death was not inevitable or a natural result of his life and accomplishments what distinguished dr king from the others , in great measure , was that he was married to someone like mrs king , who wanted for him , in the end , what he could not have wanted for himself sometimes a marriage can work that way , as mrs king clearly proved sometimes a marriage can last well beyond the death of a spouse

the white barn theater in westport , which last staged a production in 2002 but was once a haven for new writers and independent productions , is being sold but in an agreement with the theater s owner , the westport country playhouse will preserve and advance its legacy lucille lortel , later known as the queen of off broadway , founded the white barn in an old horse barn on her estate in 1947 after her death in 1999 at the age of 98 , the lucille lortel foundation in manhattan inherited the theater and 18 acres on the westportnorwalk border under an agreement reached in november between the westport playhouse and the foundation , the foundation is giving the playhouse 25 million for renovations and future productions in return , the playhouse s rehearsal hall and reception center will be named the lucille lortel white barn center and a museum commemorating the white barn and miss lortel will be established there the agreement , which involved negotiations among the foundation , the playhouse and the attorneys general of new york and connecticut , ends several years of uncertainty about the white barn s fate under the agreement , the foundation can sell the theater and surrounding land alison harris , the executive director of the westport playhouse , said both theaters had similar missions of producing summer shows and supporting new and innovative plays and writers they said they were most interested in continuing the legacy of the white barn and was it possible for us to do projects that would support this legacy , ms harris said the foundation will give the playhouse 2 million to help complete its 30 million renovation project and 500 , 000 to create opportunities at the playhouse for new playwrights , composers , directors and actors the playhouse will receive the 500 , 000 in 50 , 000 increments each year for 10 years dick ticktin , the president of the lortel foundation , said the trustees wanted to turn a dormant asset into an active one eliot spitzer , new york s attorney general , and richard blumenthal , his counterpart in connecticut , got involved to make sure that the terms of miss lortel s will were followed and that the foundation followed its bylaws mr ticktin said the 148seat white barn theater needed of extensive renovations money from the sale will go into a white barn fund that will be used to fulfill the lortel foundation s mission of supporting playwrights and theaters mr ticktin would not say how much the foundation would ask for the property , which he said would be put on the market soon the norwalk land trust is raising money to buy the site for open space paul littell , who oversees acquisitions for the trust , said he hopes the foundation will sell the property to the trust mr littell would not say how exactly how much the trust had offered but he did say that he expected it to cost several million in november , the land trust received a 450 , 000 state open space and watershed land acquisition grant toward the purchase of the white barn property fairfield county land has become prohibitively expensive and is disappearing rapidly , mr littell said a major parcel like 18 acres becomes available really once in a lifetime , and when it does , it presents a very important opportunity for public good mr littell said the trust had been in touch with several theater groups in the state in the hope that they might want to purchase the theater and keep it operating , but none had enough money joseph juliano , the manager of operations for the new england theater conference in hamden , said that the white barn specialized in experimental productions lucille s idea of theater was to really provide playwrights with opportunities to just experiment with their work , mr juliano said he said it is difficult financially for other theaters to pursue that mission lucille did n't run the place to make money , mr juliano said she had the financial wherewithal to keep it going , the personal wealth mr ticktin said it was natural for the foundation to turn to the westport country playhouse because miss lortel had worked with it in the past , including volunteering on a committee to find new subscribers ms harris said that each year westport playhouse executives will meet with the trustees of the lortel foundation to discuss the production , play or activity that the playhouse will finance with its 50 , 000 annual grant the foundation has veto power if it believes the chosen project does not correspond to the white barn mission they do n't just give us the money and we spend it as we wish , ms harris said they have the opportunity to see it fulfills lucille s legacy tazewell thompson , the artistic director of the playhouse , said the 50 , 000 will be used this year to support its production of jam and spice , a musical tribute to kurt weill , who wrote the threepenny opera with bertolt brecht marc blitzstein s adaptation of the threepenny opera ran for seven years at the theater de lys in greenwich village in 1955 , the theater was a 24th anniversary gift to miss lortel from her husband , louis schweitzer , a chemical engineer who made his fortune manufacturing cigarette papers the theater was renamed for her in 1981 kurt weill , the german jewish son of a cantor who escaped germany , was politically and socially savvy , mr thompson said there was always in his music a tongue in cheek and wink at those in power mr thompson said he was considering using the 50 , 000 grants to support a playwright in residence and to commission new plays focused on socially important issues like the environment mr thompson , who became artistic director at the playhouse in january , said he met miss lortel 20 years ago after a reading at her theater i thought she was wonderful , he said at the end of the reading she made a speech and began to pass around a hat to support the actors miss lortel , who studied acting and theater at the american academy of dramatic arts and made her broadway debut in 1925 in the theater guild production of caesar and cleopatra , with helen hayes as cleopatra after founding the white barn , miss lortel s mission , according to a foundation biography , was to present works of an unusual and experimental nature , develop the talents of new playwrights , composers , actors , director and designers and to allow established artists to open themselves up to new directions under her direction , the theater premiered plays like fam and yam by edward albee , embers by samuel beckett and the effect of gamma rays on maninthemoon marigolds by paul zindel in 1992 the white barn expanded , and miss lortel added a museum , which exhibited theatrical memorabilia from its productions and her own appearances on stage the memorabilia will be moved to the white barn center at the playhouse and will be on display at the lortel museum there photos tazewell thompson , top ,

to the editor in cleanupticut \( oped , oct 1 \) , jeffrey a meyer makes a good case for connecticut s prosecutors to have subpoena power to allow them , among other things , to investigate corruption however , mr meyer misses the mark when he likens a connecticut prosecutor to a federal prosecutor federal prosecutors ultimately answer to the attorney general of the united states , who answers to the president , who is elected by the people whom prosecutors represent whereas connecticut s 13 regional prosecutors operate with a great deal of autonomy without directly answering to the people of connecticut they are sworn to represent , when one examines the reporting structure and even the philosophy of the newly appointed chief state s attorney , kevin kane , who really supervises none of them and all one has to do to see that each regional prosecutor can sling his own gun based on his own prosecutorial philosophy is look at how the decision to seek the death penalty in connecticut is applied differently by each regional prosecutor no additional authority should be given to these governmentsanctioned gunslingers without first restructuring the prosecutorial branch so that it answers directly to the people of connecticut jim brown fairfield

the footage from iraq certainly seems that way , over and over and we can answer that question separately , because senator john kerry and president bush took us , and many of our jworld colleagues , back to 2004 on tuesday , however briefly unfortunately , for mr kerry , the d j vu on the day after must feel the same , too he told don imus this morning that he was going back to washington so as not to offer a distraction from candidates campaigns now that he s dropped , or , um , been dropped , from several campaign appearances with democratic candidates this week among those canceled for bob casey , the democratic senate candidate in pennsylvania for bruce braley , in iowa s first congressional district , and for tim walz , in minnesota s first congressional district in at least the campaign of mr walz , he was left without that star power on the same day that senator john mccain who demanded that mr kerry apologize was appearing with mr walz s republican opponent , congressman gil gutknecht mr imus was none too blunt this morning , either , telling mr kerry please stop it stop talking go home get on the bike , go windsurfing , anything mr kerry laughed at the beginning , but then got his back up again i m not going to let these guys distort something completely out of its context solely for the purpose of avoiding responsibility , which they re doing look , everybody knows i botched the joke it s not the first time anybody s done that \( listen to audio of the interview \) right , mr kerry s staff says the joke was supposed to go this way do you know where you end up if you don t study , if you aren t smart , if you re intellectually lazy \? you end up getting us stuck in a war in iraq just ask president bush well , the us fell out , as did the last line and that changed quite a bit , at least for one news cycle the white house wouldn t let go today , either the press secretary , tony snow , said this morning senator kerry may have botched the line , but what he said was insulting to the troops , and what he ought to say is , look , i botched the line , but i m sorry for giving offense we re not the one who whipped this up into a big issue senator kerry did so yesterday it s a little bit funny how mr kerry is now feeling the shunning from candidates that mr bush has been experiencing this season television and newspaper coverage used the incident , and the rejoinder by mr bush on the road in georgia on tuesday , to wrap around the campaigns and the everpresent war in iraq as the midterm season moves into the final days adam nagourney and jim rutenberg put it in perspective in today s article in the process , mr bush brought renewed attention to the war in iraq , which he defended with vigor while campaigning in georgia , at the very moment that a number of republican congressional candidates , following the advice of party strategists , were stepping up their efforts to distance themselves from the white house on the war as the campaign enters its final days president bush isn t getting our frustrations it s time to be decisive , beat the terrorists , mike mcgavick , the republican candidate for senate in washington , said in an advertisement that began running this week partition the country if we have to and get our troops home in victory in rhode island on tuesday , senator lincoln chafee , a republican struggling against a challenge from sheldon whitehouse , an antiwar democrat , began a new television advertisement reminding rhode island voters , i stood against the senate and president and voted no on the war in a debate a day earlier , mr chafee indicated he would be willing to call on defense secretary donald h rumsfeld to step down mr whitehouse has been pressing mr chafee to do just that in his television advertisements in tennessee , bob corker , a republican candidate for senate , said it was time for a new plan and a change in leadership at the pentagon in new jersey , thomas h kean jr , the republican challenging senator robert menendez , has started a new advertisement that says he wants to change the course in iraq replace rumsfeld in indiana , john hostettler , a republican congressman , reminds voters in his latest advertisement that he voted against the invasion of iraq because the intelligence did not support the claim that there were weapons of mass destruction there the washington post reports that democratic strategists say the war will be the topic of advertisements in 15 hot house races \( of course , it has been the topic in many already \) the los angeles times used the tempest to look at how close many of the senate races are , saying that the contest between jim talent and claire mccaskill in missouri could tip the balance in the battle for the majority in the senate in montana , where senator conrad burns has slipped and resurged a bit , his opponent , democrat jon tester , called senator kerry s remarks stupid both vice president dick cheney and president bush plan campaign stops for mr burns this week in the tennessee race , former president bill clinton adds his firepower to the campaign of representative harold ford jr today , following appearances by laura bush , the first lady , for the republican candidate , bob corker , the former mayor of chattanooga who shows a small lead in new polls over mr ford mr ford became the latest democratic candidate to distance himself from mr kerry s remarks , issuing a statement today , according to the chattanooga times free press s web site whatever the intent , senator kerry was wrong to say what he said , mr ford said he needs to apologize to our troops
an oped article on nov 25 about a senate resolution to honor bruce springsteen misspelled the given name of one of its sponsors it is jon corzine , not john an oped article on dec 4 about what president bush could learn from john f kennedy misstated the year of mr bush s mission accomplished speech aboard an aircraft carrier it was 2003 , not 2004 frank rich s column on dec 25 about the war on christmas referred incorrectly to how suspected witches were killed in colonial salem , mass nineteen were hanged , and one was pressed to death none were burned
dave holland critical mass \( dare2 sunnyside \) intellect and physicality have always been close partners in the music of dave holland as a bassist he combines a bruising tone with smartly nimble execution he does n't make it seem easy , but good , and right he accomplishes much the same balance in his compositions , and with his signature band critical mass is the dave holland quintet s first studio album in five years , though it does n't feel that long mr holland has kept the group visible , not only on tour but also as the nucleus for his dynamic big band and not much has changed about its basic sound or style mr holland still writes for a frontline of chris potter on tenor and soprano saxophones and robin eubanks on trombone , often entangling them in serpentine counterpoint steve nelson still provides the only harmonic accompaniment , sparingly , on vibraphone mr holland lays down his usual concrete foundation , against which a drummer can either abrade or glide \( there s a different drummer now , nate smith , but his propulsive style adheres to the established model \) as on past albums , the ensemble favors funk over swing and features tunes by each of its members and it once again manages to pair combustion with containment , so that even when things heat up as they often do , most vividly on full circle , by mr eubanks there s still control but the title still works critical mass is the point at which this band resides there are many examples on the album , none better than the squalling climax of mr nelson s amator silenti , the album s closing track it s a moment all the more impressive for what has preceded it more than an hour of heightened performance of the sort that gives reliability a good name nate chinen
readers respond to david brooks s jan 26 column ,  bob back , chicago values matter , but i sense a confusion between values and morals i counted myself a republican until the time came where they focused on legislating morality honesty and fairness are values opposing abortion and gay marriage are moral judgments morals , or more likely ethics , are what i teach my kids values , in my mind , are more cultural you re right the democrats have missed the boat on the other hand , republican leadership preaches values and expect the masses to practice them but seem to believe that the rules don t apply to them tolerance , compassion , charity , and forgiveness were all essential components of the christianity i learned as a child those are all sorely lacking in today s christian right perhaps the reason that so few actually vote and participate in society is that neither party really has it right joann patterson , kingman , ariz perhaps you and other washingtonians should be visiting small towns across the us we are a middle class family in a community that has a majority of poor and below middle class residents that struggle everyday to make ends meet most of them and we , are not suffering from ethical anxiety , but from financial anxiety financial anxiety exacts a major toll on families and that can lead to ethical anxiety , not the other way around ethical anxiety is not restricted to the poor as is evidenced by worldcom and ken lay who had money to hide their thefts and their destruction of families money in no way guarantees ethical conduct , but lack of money does contribute at times to unethical conduct you are a nice man mr brooks , but you need to stop reading all those opinionated surveys and go live in any small town usa you may experience an epiphany nancy belser , indianapolis it is not necessarily true to state that middle class women should worry more about divorce than outsourcing in fact , my middle class family could easily suffer from outsourcing at a salary somewhat above the 63 , 000 you mentioned , we don t feel that comfortable and we live a fairly modest lifestyle a major medical problem could easily put us into bankruptcy , even though we have health care coverage job loss would be traumatic although i tried to follow your argument , i am not sure what democrats should be saying about divorce , if anything , but i am more clear about the idea that health care and outsourcing are issues i care about of course , this is personalizing the issue , but that is your point , i believe , that democrats are missing the boat on the personal issues that effect the middle class you state that democrats are spending too much time on economics and not enough on values to me , their approach , although not cohesive and strong , is certainly closer to my personal values than the party of religious conservatism , big business , and tax cuts phillip granberry , boston you state , rose calculated the household incomes for people between 26 and 59 and found that the average annual family income is somewhere around 63 , 000 a year an impressive figure median income would be lower people with extremely large incomes , in the millions , will drive up a mean income i am a demographer and always report median income because it gives the middle income fewer people have income in the millions and limit their influence of the mean income statistic most government statistics report median income i am not familiar with mr roses s work but this raises my suspicion of it and weakens your important and insightful column cindy frost , alfred , me in the small village i live and the small city , portland , maine , in which i work , my social and work colleagues very often discuss and even base our daily activities on social values and concerns to imply that democrats are just beginning to understand social values strikes me as being out of touch with what i experience daily i need to tell you that i see both of our parties in trouble , but none more than the republican party , which seems to care for nothing more than money and unlimited power we are throwing away our young and middleaged armed forces members in a hopeless and poorly conceived war in iraq , thanks to our executive and legislative branches of government we have lobbyists who spend huge sums of money to access and design legislation for the benefit solely of their clients we are unwilling to come to grips with a health care system that is financially completely out of control we can not keep within a reasonable budget and are impoverishing ourselves for generations to come we imprison persons without trial and torture them we pollute and ignore environmental degradation the gap between rich and poor continues to increase we are at risk , i believe , at turning our backs on women s right to decide if they are able to become a parent , with the huge commitment that motherhood entails i ve been an active member of mainline churches since i was a baby and am a committed christian please do not imply that the republican party has a hold on righteousness or moral values the idea is repugnant to many paul childress , indianapolis i appreciate your call for democrats to wake up to some of the issues upon which middle class america will vote however , statistics can lie , and the average income number of 63 , 000 belies the growing trend of an increase between upper middle class income and lower middle class income this is not , and never has been a good trend for america like a football team that gets away from the basics of strong defense and a reliable ground game , reliance on managerial jobs and professional jobs in a country whose production is suffering may be flashy , but is not an effective strategy in the long run randal kottwitz , blue hill , neb what you miss is that longterm economic separation of the classes leads to a degradation in values the rich get richer and care less about values , the poor get poorer and have to care less about values in order to survive , and the middle class is forced to care less and less about values in order to maintain their status quo in order to keep up with the joneses economics always causes values choices it s always been that way and always will the argument you make in this column may have some tactical value , but completely misses the strategic reality mike hochleutner , san jose , calif i m in my early thirties , and i make a six figure salary to support my small family , and yet i feel economically stressed every day with the cost of housing , health care and education going up rapidly , it feels like i m on a treadmill that keeps accelerating am i missing something \? is it because i live in the bay area of california , the bluest corner of the bluest state , not to mention a spot with some frothy real estate \? perhaps so still , what i think will challenge your analysis is that , while many well off families like mine make enough to do fine in an average year , we are facing more economic risks over our lifetimes than we have since the 1930 s

the group of death , but it was decided pretty quickly wait messi to riquelme , a shot just rolls wide 50 tevez ! what hard work to get away from de cler in a part of the field where it didn t really matter it took about 10 seconds of constant jitterbugging to get loose then messi got it down the other end and created a corner with more hard work but the corner comes to nothing 49 yellow to de cler for an elbow to slapsie maxi rodriguez 48 three in the wall and van persie skies it terrible ! this crowd is dead , and i can t blame them 47 free kick for holland from 25 yards after jaliens is fouled ! 46 back under way no changes on either side as we start the second half more halftime usually the thing that crashes our system is a big surge in people coming to the blog it s entirely possible that you argentine fans have done it many of you have been sending in vaunting comments over the past couple of weeks , usually entirely in spanish and often in capital letters , exhorting your team and making pronouncements pertaining to its unbeatability oop ! we re back ! halftime well , look , it wasn t all that great a half really , i m not just saying that because our server crashed again argentina definitely had the edge in play by a fairly wide margin , but 00 is a just score at this stage some stats 5 shots for argentina , 1 for holland 8 corners for argentina , 3 for holland yet the dutch had the ball 57 percent of the time , supposedly still , no spectacular plays or true excitement , and you now how starved for excitement i am 45 1 10 the whistle ! it s 00 at the half 45 1 messi shoots , but no trouble for van der sar 45 one minute added interesting footnote this game is three seconds ahead of the serbia game 44 messi occupies two dutch defenders on the right he s dancing around out there , looking awfully poised for an 18yearold 43 a yellow for ooijer for a late tackle on riquelme 41 tevez and messi both threaten , but none of their efforts really trouble van der sar 38 hey , the ivory coast have done it again fallen behind 20 and then getting one goal back to make it 21 34 kuyt , who was given a yellow earlier , battles for the ball on the left the dutch just can t break through the argentine defense a long , hard shot by sneijder was blocked before it could get close to abbondanzieri 32 sorry we re having a server problem in the last five minutes or so , the argentines hit the crossbar once and threatened a couple of other times , but it s still 00 25 a clattering tackle by van persie on cufre , but no card unusual in this tournament 24 sub coloccini in in for burdisso , who never did fully recover from getting fallen on in that goalmouth scramble he can blame his teammate milito for that 23 messi , tevez , riquelme , burdisso , slapsie maxi rodriguez they ve had like 25 touches in a row , argentina it finally ends on an offside 21 a bit of a disappointment so far we hear that in the other match , serbia and montenegro , in their swan song together , are up 20 on ivory coast 19 ooijer does well to get past a battling messi and get the ball out of the dutch end 18 kuyt from a sharp angle abbondanzieri makes the save on the short side ! the best dutch chance so far 17 tevez ends a long possession in the dutch end with a shot , his first real touch , but it bounces wide 16 messi , el pibe de oro ! a nice move to go around a defender on the right he s stopped soon thereafter , but a tasete of things to come \? 13 van persie to take the corner jockeying in the area a foul against ooijer blows the play dead and indeed , he fell on the defender burdisso in a big pileup on the goal line , and now he s hurt now on the replay we see that milito grabbed ooijer around the neck and threw him down in any case , buridsso is up and back in the game 12 van persie puts on a show , pedaling over the ball on the right before crossing into the area it all ends up in a cornre kick for the dutch 8 great rush by the albicelestes ! cambiasso almost latched onto the pass as he broke into the area , but it was hooked away at the last second by the defender 8 the fans are mostly sitting politely we expected better from the argentines and dutch ! 5 first corner argentina s riquelme to take headed away by van persie do it again ! riquelme again right to van der sar he doesn t even have to jump for it 3rd minute the oranje get deep on the left flank , but the argentine defense holds fast the referee today is the spaniard medina cantalejo it s cloudy in frankfurt , and the roof is open at the waldstadion the temperature is 75 23 the argentine fans are singing the songs you hear at the bombonera in buenos aires holland will kick off it s on !  the national anthems the dutch first the stadium sings along to the stately song , and the players stand arms draped over one another s shoulders , singing along too big van der sar cuts an ichabod cranelike figure as he sings along big cheer at the end now argentina s operatic anthem the fans sing , but the players don t young messi looks like he s bopping along absently the fans jump up and down as the tune comes to its end with a flourish  with crespo , saviola and heinze carrying yellow , look for them to be tethered to the argentina bench today same for holland s mathijsen , van bronckhorst , robben , heitinga and maduro as for who would finish first in case of a draw , it d be argentina , by virtue of their 60 drubbing of serbia and montenegro , as opposed to the dutchmen s mere 10 defeat of the serbs both argentina and the netherlands beat ivory coast by 21 the teams are in the tunnel ! argentina in their traditional blueandwhitestriped shirts and black shorts , the dutch all in orange here they come in procession onto the field  hello again , soccer fans around the globe today , a superclasico of world football argentina vs the netherlands with both teams already safely through to the next round , and not much to choose between in terms of finishing first \( you ll either face portugal or mexico in the next game , pretty much a tossup \) , both teams are going to rest players and sit out those who are carrying a yellow card nevertheless , there will be so much skill on display , such great players on the field even though they are fillins , this could well turn out to be a real treat behold the lineups ! for the oranje of marco van basten , the customary dutch 433 formation , with kuyt and van persie in the role of wingmen g van der sar edwin \( c \) d jaliens kew d boulahrouz khalid ylw d ooijer andre d de cler tim m van der vaart rafael m cocu phillip m sneijder wesley f kuyt dirk f van persie robin f van nistelrooij ruud for the albiceleste of jose pekerman , a 442 featuring the exciting striking tandem of carlos tevez and lionel messi g abbondanzieri roberto d ayala roberto \( c \) d milito gabriel d cufre leandro d burdisso nicolas m cambiasso esteban m mascherano javier m riquelme juan m rodriguez maxi f tevez carlos f messi lionel
to the editor as a flight attendant for over 40 years for two major american international airlines , i would like to give you my view regarding the flight not taken , by michelle henderson , as told to howard gold \( oped , sept 10 \) in my opinion , her reaction to 9 11 was not a common one in the airline business to my knowledge , not one flight attendant on any of my flights after 9 11 canceled because of emotional distress however , my first flight after 9 11 was not an easy one none of us really wanted to be there as the flight leader , i asked each flight attendant how they felt about flying out that night everyone i asked was not going to let the terrorist attack stop them from going on i'm proud to say they did a great job with the passengers we had while en route to venice once in venice , we all stuck together as one big family , which is something we usually do not do it was probably best for ms henderson to quit flying i feel for her , but i am proud to say that most of the flight attendants i know did not let 9 11 change their lives eva d'angelico jamesport

when baseball s active rosters expanded to 40 from 25 friday , major league teams called up more than supplementary catchers , relievers and pinchrunners they welcomed caddies , valets and other assorted gophers consider the fate of one new lefthander in the detroit bullpen he 'll be carrying the ball bag from now on , tigers reliever joel zumaya said of andrew miller , a 21yearold rookie , who was actually promoted a few days early that s been my job all year now it s his sure enough , the job for most september callups is less to hit than to git yet some do receive significant playing time , and bring not only the doughnut tray but also a sign of their future talent not that september means a phenom stampede most top young players are either brought up during the season , when they can truly contribute , or are kept in the minors for roster or salary reasons september callups are often smorgasbords of recognizable journeymen and moonlight grahams who play one game before vanishing forever but history shows that each september has its share of new stars many of them produce excellent first months as regulars or fall flat on their fresh faces among players who appeared in at least 20 games , the best september debut since the 1961 expansion probably belongs to bill madlock in 1973 he hit 351 for the rangers in 21 games but using a bill james statistic that also credits madlock s nine extrabase hits and seven walks , his 081 runs created a game ranks highest among 116 qualifiers \( the rangers were apparently not that impressed , trading madlock to the cubs several weeks later and watching him win four batting crowns \) madlock s fellow september sizzlers did not turn out nearly as well dwayne hosey \( 079 rpg for the 1995 red sox \) was barely heard from again kevin seitzer \( 075 for the 1986 royals \) had a few fine seasons , more than ben grieve \( 075 for the 1997 a s \) , milt thompson \( 068 for the 1984 braves \) and bill sudakis \( 063 for the 1968 dodgers \) some of the most famous lateseason rookies did not qualify for this list the yankees' shane spencer , who hit eight home runs after his promotion in september 1998 , had actually been up earlier that season and fred lynn , who batted 419 for the 1974 red sox , appeared in only 15 games while a rookie s september success does not appear to mean a lot , neither does immediate failure one of the worst september debuts a 170 batting average and a 009 rpg for the 1993 indians belongs to manny ram \? z , a probable hall of famer mike piazza hit one home run in 69 atbats for the 1992 dodgers , while the future slugger andre dawson , for the 1976 expos , hit none in 85 atbats the onemonth time frame ensures that the famous and the obscure populate both ends of the list , but those who succeeded early did compile significantly better careers the top 30 players in the runs created per game standings went on to earn an average of 85 career win shares another james statistic more suited for evaluating groups of seasons compared with 50 for the bottom half so the performances of possible callups this september , like the dodgers' andy laroche and the royals' alex gordon , could be telling what about pitchers \? their september performances are much more difficult to assess because their fragile arms usually work briefly out of the bullpen or they make only a few spot starts \( those who fail in their first outings are often held back to protect their psyches \) but there have been notable exceptions in september 1980 , fernando valenzuela gave a fernandomania preview by throwing 17 2 3 shutout innings over 10 relief appearances for the dodgers that same month , the phillies callup marty bystrom went 50 with a 150 earned run average , helping philadelphia win its division and eventually the world series the most celebrated september phenom is probably karl spooner of the 1954 brooklyn dodgers he took the mound twice , throwing a 30 shutout against the new york giants \( with 15 strikeouts \) , then , on the last day of the season , tossing a 10 shutout over the pirates earning an appearance on the ed sullivan show but sadly , injuries knocked spooner out of the big leagues at age 24 , with brooklynites still wondering what might have been teams handle their pitchers far more carefully nowadays , often giving youngsters a few late appearances simply to get the yips out that certainly worked for the rookie sensation justin verlander , who made two starts for the tigers last september before breaking out with 15 victories this year verlander , who was scheduled to pitch last night , said , i think those two starts helped me more than the entire minor league season as with so many callups , september simply groomed verlander s carrying skills first the ball bags then the ball club
there are as many nohitters in the front office of the los angeles angels as there have been in the major leagues for more than four seasons bill stoneman , the general manager of the angels , pitched two nohitters for montreal , one in 1969 and the other in 1972 ken forsch , the team s assistant general manager , pitched a nohitter for houston in 1979 the angels also have in their front office a former manager , preston gomez , who twice removed pitchers \( clay kirby and don wilson \) for pinchhitters in losing games even though they had not allowed a hit over eight innings , but that s another story this story is about the startling disappearance of nohitters they have become an endangered species no one has pitched a nohitter in the major leagues in more than two years , since randy johnson pitched a perfect game for arizona in may 2004 no american league pitcher has pitched a nohitter in more than four years , since derek lowe threw one for boston in april 2002 pitchers do n't even make it into the ninth inning anymore with a nohitter looming three outs away , research from the elias sports bureau shows since johnson s perfect game , only eric milton of cincinnati has pitched eight complete innings without allowing a hit no american league pitcher has taken a nohitter into the ninth since lowe s nohitter three pitchers chris young of the padres , carlos zambrano of the cubs and matt cain of the giants have lost nohitters in the eighth inning this season eight others since johnson have given up their first hits in the eighth since lowe s nohitter , a dozen al pitchers have given up their first hits in the eighth onehitters \? yes , there have been some , although not many anthony reyes of st louis pitched the third of the season june 22 , allowing only a jim thome home run in the seventh inning that gave the white sox a 10 victory on friday , five yankees pitchers combined to hold the mets to one hit and a night later , miguel batista of the diamondbacks pitched a perfect game for six and twothirds innings before settling for a threehitter against oakland nine national league pitchers have thrown onehitters since johnson s perfect game seven al pitchers have had onehitters since lowe s nohitter san francisco s cain , a 21yearold righthander in what should be his first full major league season , has come close to a nohitter twice he allowed a thirdinning double by jay payton of oakland in his may 21 onehitter and held the angels hitless last monday until chone figgins singled with two outs in the eighth only once in its history has the al gone this long without a hitless performance this drought has lasted four and onethird seasons the al went nearly six seasons without a nohitter 60 years ago , from bob feller s openingday performance on april 16 , 1940 , to dick fowler s nohitter on sept 9 , 1945 fans want to see nohitters , stoneman said in a telephone interview i think back on my first one there were only about 5 , 000 fans in the stands in philadelphia after about five innings they were n't philly fans anymore they were rooting for a nohitter why are pitchers having trouble throwing nohitters \? pitchers do n't pitch complete games anymore , stoneman said you got to go nine to pitch a nohitter forsch echoed his comments when we pitched , we went nine innings , he said now pitchers are conditioned to go 100 pitches regardless of where they are in the game that gets them into the seventh inning usually managers would take them out anyway they 're saving them for their next start stoneman cited a game the angels played against minnesota on may 31 , in which francisco liriano of the twins allowed no hits in the first five innings jason kubel led off the sixth with a single we were n't getting a sniff off him , stoneman said we finally got a hit , and i credit the official scorer for the hit he left after the inning stoneman said that ron gardenhire , the twins manager , said he was going to take liriano out anyway because he had been a reliever liriano , who threw 104 pitches in that game , may turn into a pitcher capable of throwing a nohitter there s not that type of pitcher anymore , mets pitching coach rick peterson said they 're few and far between if you look at the pitchers who pitched nohitters , you 're talking about a potential nohitter every time they went out there who can you name today whom you 'd say he can pitch a nohitter \? nolan ryans there might not be , but ryan and johnson are n't the only ones whose names populate the nohit list how about bobo holloman and bo belinsky \? it must be the scorekeepers , doug melvin , the brewers' general manager , said , joking turning serious , he said the lineups are deeper than they were in the past there are no ray oylers or dal maxvills or gene michaels or fred stanleys in the lineups you get to the no 8 and no 9 guys and you 're still facing pretty good hitters managers are probably happy their pitchers are n't holding teams hitless , because otherwise they could face a difficult decision if a pitcher has thrown , say , 110 pitches through seven innings , none of them for a hit , should the manager let him try to complete the nohitter at the risk of throwing what would be perceived as too many pitches \? but managers are seldom faced with that predicament when gomez removed kirby and wilson from their eightinning nohitters , he did it because his team , in each instance , was losing and he opted for a pinchhitter i remember kenny forsch teasing him about it , stoneman said gomez s moves did n't work his pitchers did n't get their nohitters , and he lost both games
washington the day we mourned a man whose life was devoted to clarity , this city was hidden in fog you could n't see the potomac , even on its bank there were many things to love about david rosenbaum he had a grin that always improved the weather he was uncommonly generous to reporters he worked with and competed against he was an exemplary husband , father , brother , uncle and grandfather but the truly astonishing thing about david , the times reporter who was killed in a random robbery a week ago , was his unglamorous , unsanctimonious , unvain sort of goodness he had a blackandwhite sense of honor that was oddly oldfashioned in a capital slimed by lies , bribery , greed , corruption and endsjustifythemeans malarkey the skells , as detective sipowicz would say , saw david walking in his neighborhood after dinner and whacked him in the head with a pipe one lowlife bought laundry detergent , gas and tires with david s credit card while he lay dying our friend david shribman , the executive editor of the pittsburgh postgazette , wrote in the st petersburg times , where david rosenbaum started a thoughtful man struck down by the ultimate act of thoughtlessness a man who taught others when to use 'that' and when to use 'which' only to be felled by that over which he had no control despite george washington and the cherry tree , we no longer have a society especially consecrated to truth the culture produces an infinity of tv shows and movies depicting the importance of honesty but they 're really talking only about the importance of being honest about your feelings sharing feelings is not the same thing as telling the truth we 've become a country of situationalists journalism , politics and publishing have been tarred by scandals that have revealed a chilling insensitivity to right and wrong random house is n't concerned that an author makes up stuff in a book labeled nonfiction it just kept counting the money after the smoking gun exposed james frey s lies about his own life when mr frey went on larry king live with his mom to defend his book s essential truths , oprah winfrey called in to back him up she sounded disturbingly like scott mcclellan despite doubts about facts in the book , she said , the underlying message of redemption still resonates with her she should have said had i known that many parts were fake , i would n't have recommended the book to millions of loyal viewers i would n't have made this liar a lot of money she should take a page from stephen colbert and put the slippery frey on her dead to me list for david rosenbaum , just retired at 63 but still full of enthusiasms , there was a right way and a wrong way , and he possessed a natural knowledge of which was which my father taught me the importance of always doing the right thing , always , even when it did n't really matter , his daughter , dottie , said at the memorial service yesterday in a committee room at the senate , david s old beat at my 12th birthday party , my parents took me and a bunch of friends to see a movie , and they counted up how many of us were already 12 so that they could pay the adult fare even though none of us carried id , and we all looked like total pipsqueaks as his pal robin toner put it , david thought that behind every arcane tax provision and appropriations bill , there were real people , getting something or having something taken away by their government you had to keep digging and arguing to find the truth in the fog even when he was smothered by conventional wisdom , robin recalled , david s voice would break out 'i disagree !

it s her ! wait , who s she with \? wait not him \? with him \? ! \? probably the juiciest power lunch of the week unfolded at the four seasons yesterday as senator hillary rodham clinton sized up her 2008 presidential chances with none other than the republican power broker alfonse m d'amato , with former mayor edward i koch merrily riding shotgun mr d'amato , the former senator from new york , described himself in an interview yesterday as a big , big fan of hers , \( though he will be supporting a republican in 2008 \) , and said he told her not to lose a minute s sleep over her possible democratic rival what shisname , obama the three dine together once or twice a year , with each taking a turn at picking up the check \( mrs clinton , who had the 56 dover sole , paid yesterday , so the white house consultation did come at a price , something north of 250 \) over salad , nantucket bay scallops and a plate of heavenly truffles \( gratis \) , mr d'amato and mr koch said they analyzed the 2008 field , and both predicted that senator john mccain would be the republican nominee and that former mayor rudolph w giuliani would be his running mate mr koch said he told mrs clinton that she would triumph over that ticket , while mr d'amato , a friend of both men , would not reveal how he rated her chances my republican colleagues would do well to take notice of a very focused , energetic , organized , articulate , bright senator who , if she does run for president , should be taken as a very , very serious candidate , mr d'amato said some people say she ca n't win well , some people also said the republicans would n't lose the senate and we did republicans would make a terrible mistake underestimating her mr d'amato also made it clear at the lunch that he believed mrs clinton would win the democratic nomination if she sought it , and that her chief rival of late , senator barack obama of illinois , would wilt under media scrutiny you always have a flavorofthemonth candidate at one point it was governor warner of virginia , now it s what shisname , obama but that s not going to hold up to a campaign by senator clinton , mr d'amato said though they may make a good onetwo the two men analyzed the republican field and the dynamics of the race , they said , while senator clinton mostly listened , and avoided tipping her hand she s a marvelous listener , and al is a wonderful talker , mr koch said it was a match made in heaven i sat on the sidelines , waving to people who were waving at us mr d'amato said he had not picked a republican favorite , but said senator mccain looked like the right horse , assuming that his age \( 70 \) and health \( past bouts with skin cancer \) do not hobble him health and age will certainly be raised i hope his people do n't think i'm raising it , but it will be in the minds of every person who will cover him , mr d'amato said mr koch , who often supports republicans , said he strongly supported a clinton candidacy and believed she would beat any republican mrs clinton has been having similar chitchats at other meals and meetings in recent weeks , including one on wednesday night in washington with former advisers to her husband , including james carville and paul begala asked about yesterday s lunch , howard wolfson , an adviser to mrs clinton , said she always appreciates the opportunity to sit down with the mayor and the senator the restaurant s grill room , usually filled with power lunchers , where vernon jordan and sanford weill were among the patrons yesterday , began buzzing madly when mrs clinton walked in around 1 , the two men said , and about 25 people came by to say hello as she was preparing to leave at 3 it was like the second coming of christ , said julian niccolini , the coowner not everyone was mad for herself one patron noticed that mr niccolini was wearing a hillary button , and was moved to comment the customer said , 'what are you , a communist \?

united states army first lt shawn hammond is not your typical junior infantry officer he is a big man , with a high forehead crowed with brown hair rapidly turning to salt and pepper having just turned 40 , he has been a single father of three boys aged 15 , 14 and 8 for years , although he remarried just before this deployment he left active service over ten years ago , remaining in the ready reserve after finishing his master s degree in psychology , hammond attended law school with the goal of coming back in as a jag \( judge advocate general \) however , after setting up a practice he did not return to the active reserve because he felt his civilian role as sole attorney for a battered women shelter in augusta , ga , assumed greater importance nothing would lead anyone to believe that his actions would be a key element of the defense of a forward operating base in the pech river valley , a combat infantry officer leading a dozen soldiers in an hourlong firefight in the summer of 2005 , he got his letter in the mail , ordering him to active duty as an individual augmentee after training at fort benning , ga , and camp shelby , miss , he joined the staff of the training assistance group at kabul military training center assigned in early 2006 , he has served as the deputy personnel officer , basically the military equivalent of an assistant human resources manager for our team as an additional duty he has assisted with the security forces platoon in their routine patrols in and around our sector last weekend , he joined a platoon in inspecting their area of operations in the vicinity of asadabad in the pech river valley in eastern afghanistan as part of their tour , the security platoon stopped to bring much needed supply items and conduct basic presence patrols while inspecting the readiness and defensive perimeters of several remote fob s each fob is manned by a team of us soldier mentors that advise a platoon of afghan national army soldiers after traveling down what is widely called the eighth most dangerous road in the world , hammond s team hunkered down for the night at one of the fob s he and a dozen troops that were preparing to rotate out of this area did one last security inspection before bedding down for a night that none of them will soon forget in his own words , hammond offered those taking a beating were getting one last beating before they left at around 6 30 pm the soldiers discovered the first sign of what was to come one of them found that the wire outside the major line of defense had been cut and a path cleared in order to crawl under the wire the soldier alerted hammond he ordered the men to fix the wire without using any flashlights i thought that if we repaired \( the enemy s \) entry point without their knowledge , we could fix them and destroy them so we were waiting for them , hammond later said later in the evening the security patrols saw lights on the mountain that surrounded their position at 11 pm , the team increased their security posture intelligence had informed the unit that there was a 30man anticoalition militia accompanied by a local taliban leader , conducting cross border operations further , there had been a confirmed attack in the area just the previous day , where militia members had killed four teachers for daring to instruct girls in basic literacy as terrible as this seems , it is one of the main tactics of terror used by the enemy we face every day here in other words , it is an unfortunate factor of this war that many of us have gotten used to the challenge for the platoon in this instance was that many of the afghan soldiers normally based in the fob with their american counterparts had been sent away to hunt for the men who had murdered four teachers , leaving the fob with much less than its usual line of defense but being in a reinforced fob , surrounded by hesco barriers \( dirt filled four foot wide walls \) the platoon thought we were safe it was about 2 am when those not pulling security were brought to full alert with a startling alarm clock mortars were being walked into the fob the entire compound was manning security positions within five minutes while the first two mortar rounds fell short of their target , it did not take long for the enemy to adjust his fires i was just outside the tactical operations center when the third round came in about sixty meters from my location the flash surprised me , said hammond the overpressure from the blast definitely impacted the first sergeant and i but no one was hurt , he concluded but the men were ready for this attack and quickly moved to their designated positions with five hmmwv s \( high mobility , multiwheeled vehicle , commonly referred to as hummvees \) in position , the gunners rapidly got into position behind their crew served weapons , the m240b and the ma deuce , 50 caliber machine guns hammond , an expert marksman , moved to a position between two of the vehicles on the perimeter with an svd dragonov rifle in hindsight , he said it seemed like a good thing to bring his men were very glad for his foresight the weapon , a sovietera sniper rifle is incredibly accurate once zeroed when wielded by a sharpshooter of his talent with a rifle , the 40yearold lieutenant said plainly , when you re fat , you need to be a good shot , because ya ain t going to be able to run away he continued i went to the hesco wall and started firing upon the taliban positions based on the muzzle flashes that we could clearly see up on the mountainside i had the 1sg right next to me so i was spotting the positions with the tracer fire and enabling the secfor guys to direct their fire , he said the dragonov was loaded with tracer rounds , thus enabling others to target their fires on where the fireworks are going the problem , which soon became evident , was that in helping to pinpoint the enemy positions , the hammond also gave away his own location for the mortar men in the hills , which really wasn t a good feeling , he said the only protection available for the lieutenant and his senior noncommissioned officer was the hesco barrier to their immediate front with enemy fire cracking over their heads and all alongside them , the gunners of the machine guns began to synchronize their fires , maintaining the rhythm and keeping the enemy s heads down the enemy finally got a bead on the position of the de facto platoon leader s position , and brought a mortar round six feet in front of his position violently thrown to the ground , the lieutenant and his first sergeant were temporarily deafened by the ringing in their ears and disoriented by the thunderous pounding in their heads i was trying my best not to vomit , said hammond , reflecting the common feeling soldiers experience when bombarded with danger close mortar fire the disorientation is so strong that it makes you feel like an astronaut in training it is an act of extreme will not to lose control had it not been for the fourfoot thick protection of the hesco , the two of them would likely have not lived to tell their story hammond recovered to his fighting position not typically an illtempered or foul mouthed man , i just started swearing at them with every curse in the book , as if they could hear me from 800 meters away , he recalled once hammond had spent his ammo , he quickly became an ammo bearer for the other gunners over the course of an hourlong engagement , the soldiers defending the fob spent 4 , 000 rounds after almost exactly an hour , the fire stopped and the lights disappeared from the ridgeline it seemed to the platoon that the threat had retreated east , in the borderlands between afghanistan and pakistan they maintained their full security posture for about an hour , and conducted an aar \( after action review \) of the activities , checking equipment and each other for potential injuries amazingly , no one was injured none of the platoon members slept after the engagement after ensuring the security of the fob , they headed back to kabul via jalalabad , leaving around 9 am at around 4 in the afternoon , the group returned to camp alamo here in kabul where we learned the story of the previous night s activities the story of shawn hammond is an interesting one to me because it is an example of the stories that are rarely told it is the story of those members of the individual ready reserve , for all intents and purposes , members who are names in a database available for duty at the order of the president of the united states these are men and women who had served in active or reserve forces , then returned to civilian life there are many members of the irr active now , having been called to service in this conflict some have found loopholes to get out of returning to service or taken advantage of opportunities to resign but the great majority of them have answered the nation s call and mustered out for duty lieutenant hammond was not planning on valorous deeds when he answered the call he initially tried to explain to the army his extenuating circumstances but when his orders came , he met the challenge and got to work his story is just one of many from this front , the place where the global war on terror began afghanistan is turning a page in its history and no matter how many naysayers or realists there are that call for more troops and more resources , i can tell you that this nation is already succeeding due in part to the efforts of citizensoldiers answering the call of duty
the competition to redevelop the 77acre nassau veterans memorial coliseum site in uniondale , and in the process to create a new suburban center in nassau county , has taken on a new look in the last week but the eventual picture will not include charles b wang s 60story lighthouse tower two of the four proposals for the site underwent major revisions most notably the withdrawal of plans for the tower by mr wang , the owner of the new york islanders and a founder of computer associates of islandia , and scott rechler , the chief executive of reckson associates realty of melville mr wang and mr rechler told nassau officials of their concession in a letter tinged with bitterness the tower would have been the centerpiece for what they called the lighthouse project , a 1 billion commercial , sports and residential makeover of the coliseum property at the same time , and in response to a dec 23 deadline that the county set for final offers from the competing developers , the new york mets development corporation expanded its plans with a proposal to knock down the 34yearold coliseum and replace it with a new arena as part of a broader 15 billion project the mets' proposal also includes a station for a lightrail spur none of the three proposals competing with mr wang s and mr rechler s include a tower , though all envision multistory buildings mr wang had campaigned across the county to build public support for his tower , which he referred to as a lighthouse he had promoted it as a presence that , besides being the tallest structure on long island , would give both the nassau hub and the island a soaring new sense of identity critics said the tower was grandiose , presumptuous and an affront to the lowslung suburban horizon the proposal lost much of its momentum when the county executive , thomas r suozzi , said during his reelection campaign that he was not in favor of the idea he had previously urged mr wang to come up a plan that would revive the coliseum s sagging fortunes in their letter , dated dec 22 but not released by the county until wednesday , mr wang and mr rechler said that although they had argued repeatedly that the project needed a distinctive icon , they were not willing to allow the tower to be the political football that keeps the lighthouse project from becoming a reality for the benefit of long island accordingly , the letter continued , the lighthouse vision will no longer contain the tower instead , we will work with the town of hempstead to develop an appropriate icon for the project the letter did not say what would be appropriate , and the project s spokesman , chris botta , said that mr wang had not specified whether it needed to be a tall structure mr wang had previously expressed frustration with the slow pace of county action his letter accused the county of allowing the coliseum , the home of the islanders , to become one of the worst venues in the country and the last choice in the new york metropolitan area for concerts and other events the wangrechler plan calls for renovating and enlarging the coliseum the letter also called the coliseum a financial drain on an already fiscally beleaguered county and said that the islanders had lost 100 million over the last five years the letter ended with a plea that the lighthouse project be put before the county legislature for an immediate vote but the county s selection process makes that unlikely helena e williams , a deputy county executive , said the county would provide its consultants with the responses from the four development teams she said the consultants would report back by midjanuary and an evaluation team , which includes herself and two others , would make recommendations to mr suozzi mr suozzi s choice of a proposal would then go to the legislature , where public hearings would precede a vote mr botta said mr wang had made it clear as long ago as nov 10 , when the development teams made presentations to the evaluation committee and mr suozzi , that he was open to alternatives to the tower the other three development teams have visions of their own the proposal by the mets corporation and its partners , the blumenfeld development group of syosset and sterling equities of great neck , would raze the coliseum to make way for a new one and add a station for a lightrail spur connecting the site to the long island rail road s hempstead or mineola stations the plan also envisions a hotel , retail stores , a convention center , housing and a minor league baseball stadium a pedestrian bridge over earl overton boulevard and a walkway would connect hofstra university to the site the university president , stuart rabinowitz , has endorsed the group s overall development plan polimeni international of garden city and the cordish company of baltimore have proposed a 725 million center for county offices , apartment buildings and condominiums and 150 million in coliseum improvements the fourth bidder , engel burman of lynbrook and kabro associates of woodbury , has proposed an 800 million project for office buildings and up to 800 condominiums in four 15story buildings that would include units for the elderly their plan does not address the coliseum

the bagger is writing this on i95 , a meat grinder of a freeway that is as far from the glitz of the oscars as can be imagined he has spent the weekend in dc , where readers will be stunned to learn that absolutely no one is talking about the oscars when he mentioned that he had just interviewed a woman in new york who is the midst of a major campaign , they were pretty sure that he meant hilary clinton many of the people who knew the bagger from his days as a real journalist in the district asked him what he was doing for a living the bagger , shamed by his lack of policy cred , suggested that he was busy consulting on a number of major projects given the web surfing habits of his dc posse , he s pretty sure they will be none the wiser but you don t love the bagger because he is smart or weighty you love him because he embraces his inner oscarninny with every fiber of his being while the people around him were bracing for the findings of the bipartisan iraq study group , the bagger was focused on questions of real public moment for example , will eddie murphy come all the way back and end up with a statue in his hands , and what language will penelope cruz dream in next \?
today i m going to talk about the two things closest to my heart the marine corps combat art collection and my daughter on friday i checked in off of postdeployment leave for two weeks i had made the rounds of family and friends my daughter is a freshman at a large university in boston , and my leave happily coincided with her spring break being with her was the highlight of my time off i don t know who was more concerned this past fall and early winter , her or i she was fearful about my being in a war zone , and i was in an absolute panic about her debut into the world of complete independence while i was half a planet away we re somewhat adept at being apart since second grade , when her mom and i divorced , she s had a primary residence other than mine for most of her childhood she lived nearby , so we spent every other weekend and each wednesday evening together we worked on many science fair projects and book reports and enjoyed holidays and summer vacations at the jersey shore when she entered tenth grade , she and her mother moved to maine there was still thanksgiving and the shore , but the geographical separation was hard , at least for me since 9 11 she s endured four of my deployments she wanted to spend her break with me and i was thrilled she didn t want to hear gory war stories , and i didn t quiz her about the usual messy freshmen year indiscretions or if indeed there had been any indiscretions we did a lot of shopping , and i was happily surprised by the eclectic mix of music on her ipod before she went off to college , when we took road trips i had to endure listening ad infinitum to two cd s american idiot by green day and good charlotte s first album now , her ipod is loaded with over 2 , 000 tunes , none by those two groups we listened to everything from sara brightman singing andrew llyod webber showtunes and artsy kate bushesque stuff to nowclassic songs from 1960 s \( the byrds \) and 70 s \( the romantics \) she loves turn , turn , turn and was amazed to learn that the lyrics by pete seeger come from the book of ecclesiastes in the bible driving down from boston we sang in unison , that s what i like about you i m looking forward to turning her on to the real kate bush and eclectic stuff like the german group kraftwerk now , some history behind the marine corps art collection there are approximately 7500 pieces of art in the collection the works go all the way back to the founding of our republic and include everything from the first painting showing a united states marine to rare recruiting posters a good portion of the collection comes from the combat art program from combat artists , both civilian and military fielded by the marine corps the program dates back to a wwi marine officer , john w thomason , an infantry officer who sketched for his own edification and turned his drawings and combat experience into a powerful illustrated book titled fix bayonets ! between the two world wars lt john capolino produced historical paintings , primarily of current and past marine corps battles and operations during wwii , the korean war and the vietnam war , the combat art program produced thousands of images , both sketches and finished work , for the collection wellknown living artists that have sprung from this tradition include harry jackson , howard terpning and henry casselli  following the vietnam war the combat art program became a function of the historical division and was staffed by reserve marines there are currently two official combat artists , myself and maj alex durr , who s presently enroute to iraq major durr has a web site at www alexdurr com \) this coming november the national museum of the marine corps will be opening at quantico , va , and the artwork will be available for public viewing a show of my artwork is scheduled to be exhibited at the james a michener art museum in doylestown , pa in july 2007 why does the marine corps have an active fine art program \? this question is often posed to me with a raised eyebrow , and is difficult to answer the martial reputation and public perception of the marine corps is a powerful one , and in most of our minds heavily weighted in a direction away from anything remotely associated with art and culture admittedly , we marines are often the culprits in perpetuating the popular image of the gruff antiintellectual warrior but in truth , the marine corps at its center is concerned with excellence and the values that inform and animate a free and open democracy in a free society art can exist for its own sake in a military organization , which in many ways is a distinctly closed and undemocratic culture , the challenge to keep democratic values and attitudes alive is critical nations have succumbed to internal coups because their military culture lost sight of what they swore to defend in the first place one of the many ways the marine corps nurtures a healthy devotion to the core values of our american republic is through its combat art program as i mentioned in my first post , marine artists are sent into harm s with one basic order do art this official directive has no subject matter , medium , style or quantity attached the marines simply makes it possible for the combat artist to create from one of the most elemental visual sources people and places in times of war we marines who ve been honored with the chance to be combat artists are completely free to follow our own artistic sensibilities

there are 108 licensed dogs in this village of 4 , 800 , but as so often happens elsewhere in the county and in communities far beyond , none of them are free to roam unleashed on public property that , however , is about to change the village is officially opening its first offleash , fencedin dog park today in a quarteracre plot at the corner of north evarts and winthrop avenues , a former staging site for transportation workers just off interstate 287 elmsford s mayor , robert williams , a selfdescribed dog lover who does not own a dog at the moment \( his last one , a shih tzu , died about a year ago \) , said the park was right in the middle of the village , which is nice , but it s also close to 287 , so it wo n't bother the people who say that dogs bark too much twothirds of the park s area is reserved for large breeds , while the rest is for small ones , he said the process of creating the dog park seems to have unfolded with none of the squabbles and controversy that have mired them elsewhere in pound ridge , dog owners have lobbied the town unsuccessfully for three years to designate a leashfree play area for dogs in greenburgh , the town board has not approved a proposal to construct a dog park , mainly because of liability concerns , said paul j feiner , the town s supervisor mayor williams said he was not worried about lawsuits in elmsford the village s insurance company will treat the dog park just like every other municipal park , he said if something happens to a dog or to a person , he said , it should be handled the same way as we handle a kid who falls off a swing the town s insurance rates will not rise because of the dog park , he said the village will ban violent dogs and allow only those who have had their shots to enter the park , mayor williams said he said the police would conduct spot checks of vaccination tags there are two other dog parks in westchester county , in ossining and in white plains , county officials said in white plains , which opened its dog park off belway place in 2004 , liability is assigned to the dog owners , who also play a role in keeping the park clean , said arne abramowitz , the city s commissioner of recreation and parks it s pretty much selfpolicing , mr abramowitz said if you do n't clean up after your dog , people will say , 'this is not appropriate , ' or 'this is gross and you should n't do it' the dog park has also become a popular spot for singles , especially on fridays , when dog owners meet and make dates for the weekend , he said mayor williams said that dozens of residents in elmsford had asked officials over the past two years to create a dog park last winter , the town picked the site , fenced it in during the spring and installed benches , a water fountain and garbage cans to collect dog waste , at a cost of less than 5 , 000 angela white , 37 , has two labrador retrievers , biscuit and donut , whom she keeps on a leash when she takes them for a walk ms white said that she , her husband , martin , and their two children planned to celebrate donut s 7th birthday today by taking the dogs to the park for their first free run since puppy school the dogs love icecream cake , so we 're going to have to bring a cake down , she said it should be a little party for our family , but if other dogs feel like it , they 're welcome to join in photo play angela and martin white with their 5yearold son , anthony , and their labrador retrievers biscuit , jumping , and donut in elmsford s dog park , which officially opens today \( photo by alan zale for the new york times \)
the yankees have full control over the future of gary sheffield , their right fielder of the past they only wish they had control of daisuke matsuzaka , the pitcher they hope will be their ace of the future major league baseball closed its offices last night without hearing from matsuzaka s japanese team , the seibu lions , who have been notified of the amount of the highest bid for his negotiating rights but patrick courtney , a spokesman for the commissioner s office , said baseball officials were awaiting a call from the lions at any hour the lions were expected to accept the bid when they do , the team that made it will be notified it could happen 10 minutes from now or four days from now , randy levine , the yankees' president , said yesterday at a news conference on staten island i ca n't comment on any of the specifics the rules of the japanese posting process make it a confidential process the team that wins matsuzaka s rights with bids possibly reaching 20 million or more will have 30 days to negotiate a contract with his agent , scott boras the yankees and the texas rangers have acknowledged that they bid the mets , the boston red sox , the chicago cubs and the arizona diamondbacks are other possible bidders matsuzaka , a 26yearold , hardthrowing righthander , went 175 with a 213 earned run last season he could be the best available starter in a winter with a relatively thin class of freeagent pitchers the yankees expect to resign mike mussina , with negotiations on a twoyear contract resuming today or tomorrow they know they will have three other starters back next season chienming wang , randy johnson and carl pavano but the health of johnson and pavano make signing matsuzaka imperative johnson had back surgery last month , and general manager brian cashman said the yankees were not counting on him to be ready by opening day pavano , who missed last season with a variety of injuries , is working with a trainer in arizona we have a huge investment in carl , cashman said yeah , he is one of the five we are going to have to count on him , no doubt about that cashman later conceded that he could not necessarily depend on pavano , underscoring the yankees' need for depth in their rotation it was still a more comfortable topic for cashman than the latest rant by sheffield , whose 13 million option was exercised sunday at a restaurant opening wednesday in manhattan , sheffield claimed he was better than his teammate bobby abreu and said middlemen a reference to cashman had prevented him from talking with the yankees' principal owner , george steinbrenner unable to become a free agent , sheffield wants a twoyear contract extension but his contract allows the yankees to trade him , and they intend to do so cashman said he had had good dialogue with sheffield but he would not comment further levine had more to say bottom line nothing but a lot of noise , levine said of sheffield , adding later , if he decides to play with us , or we decide to trade him , then we will trade him or he wo n't be playing baseball i think it is obvious to everybody that he does n't have a notrade clause and he is trying to pretend that he does i do n't blame him for trying to provide himself with leverage , but the truth is he has none sheffield has also referred to steinbrenner s declining health , although the general partner steve swindal , who is steinbrenner s soninlaw , disputed that mr steinbrenner s health is fine , swindal said , and brian is in charge of the baseball operations and that is who players and their agents should be dealing with cashman listed several areas of need , including backup catcher , a righthandedhitting first baseman , a lefthanded reliever and a utility infielder he said other teams now understand he intends to keep third baseman alex rodriguez i have n't received many lately , cashman said , referring to trade proposals for rodriguez everybody believes we are not going to trade him , and we are not , but it did n't stop teams from calling staten island partnership the yankees announced a partnership with mandalay baseball properties to jointly operate the staten island yankees of the new yorkpenn league the yankees want to make more money from the team , which they believed had not generated adequate profits we are trying to turn this situation around , randy levine said glavine a free agent pitcher tom glavine filed for free agency yesterday and would not exercise an option to return to the mets next season for a 75 million salary , his agent , gregg clifton , said yesterday glavine , who went 157 with a 382 era this season , had to decide by today about his option the mets have until nov 20 to decide on their option to bring him back in 2007 at 14 million

throughout history , art has surged forth in most all times and places , fulfilling , it would seem , some basic human will to create to that extent , art remains the same animal it was centuries ago i was reminded of this not too long ago , in new haven , while viewing several art projects in alternative spaces , mostly by younger local artists none of these exhibitions has any commercial imperative , the artists motivated instead by the simple giddy pleasure of making my first stop was grand projects , an artistrun garagecumgallery in the suburbs where nathan lewis is exhibiting a 53foot long wraparound wall painting the painting , which is really a kind of art installation , combines imagery of power transmission towers with pop cultural references it is an absurd fantasy landscape mr lewis , a new haven resident , hit upon the idea of using industrial towers in his paintings a couple of years back after finding a plastic tower on the side of the road he was teaching art history at the time , and made the association between industrial towers and famous towered structures , like mosques and the milan cathedral mr lewis sees the towers in his work , he says , as pedestals for figures of authority but they are also , more broadly , symbols for institutions of power towers that lean or sway are often meant to symbolize unstable or fallen institutions , while towers that remain erect symbolize more forthright , stable or stillevolving ones pop culture references and appropriated imagery surround the towers among them are images taken from the internet , advertising and television , interspersed with those the artist made or took himself , including some photographs of actual industrial towers and mounds of industrial debris from the ongoing demolition of the new haven coliseum the dialogue between the industrial towers and cultural imagery pretty well defines the piece it is about the relentless march of time , history and the rise and fall of civilizations just as the foundations of one civilization are laid on the left side of the mural , to the righthand side the foundations of another begin to crumble , war and die it is the order of things by and large , the questions mr lewis seeks to address in this mural are those that have for millenniums remained unanswered these questions , which have long haunted artists , cluster about the nature of the human condition and our place in the universe this is partly what keeps art fresh , but also what makes it the same mr lewis has another work on display at installation project space , a new , nearby project gallery established by the artist janet van horne the piece is an untitled photographic collage , one of several works on display here made in response to an unusual curatorial experiment each artist was invited to make an artwork from a pile of lumber in the gallery , document it , and then dismantle whatever they made the subsequent documentation of the works is displayed on the walls mr lewis , curiously , chose to lay out the lumber on the floor of the gallery in a spiral , photograph it , and then cut and combine the photographs to make an elongated towerlike montage of his imagery the result is a new and independent work of art , although one that reminds you in some ways of his mural the use of montage , for starters , along with the haunting symbolism of towers other artists included in the exhibition pursued different tactics hanni bresnick , collaborating with her mother , anna bresnick , decided to photograph clumps of scrap lumber thrown into the air , while colleen tully took images of lumber arrangements and manipulated them postproduction to make more interesting , abstract imagery ms van horne , who also participated in the project , painted over her documentary imagery , which to my eyes adds little to the overall work and yet it does n't really matter what these works look like , for the project is more about plumbing one of the enduring mysteries of human life the artistic impulse , the source and soul of creativity there is something weirdly primitive about the experiment that grabbed me what i liked is how different are each of the artists' responses to the same set of materials , how each has produced a work that is alien to its neighbor this points to something fiercely individual about the human spirit , and our immense capacity for creativity nathan lewis is at grand projects , 61 lyon street , new haven , though jan 31 information \( 203 \) 4154605 or www grandprojects com the wood pile

to the editor re the system s broken \( column , oct 30 \) bob herbert is absolutely right the rhetoric and sound bites have reached ludicrous levels it is only and always about democratic or republican , with demonization and extremism on both sides large amounts of money are wasted on idiotic campaigns , and the real problems of real people are not addressed perhaps a first step in fixing the mess would be to eliminate party affiliation in voter registration let us all just be voters who are in no one s column and must be persuaded by intelligent and civilized presentations of ideas and programs we 've got to stop the political tribalism that has taken over the democratic process of our republic ! andrea cukor berkeley , calif , oct 31 , 2006 to the editor bob herbert discusses the fact that many americans are disenchanted by politics some do n't like the shallow nature of political discourse but politicians would n't talk down to us if we were n't so easily manipulated and reluctant to educate ourselves some do n't vote because they think that their vote wo n't have any effect , or they do n't support any particular candidate for them , the shortterm action is simple vote for a third party , or write in none of the above imagine the message that politicians would receive if the americans who do n't vote took the trouble to go to the polls to express their anger it s a much more powerful message than what they now give , which is i do n't care while the government bears a great responsibility to fix the system , the american people share much of the blame ashvin shah amherst , mass , oct 30 , 2006 to the editor reading bob herbert s column about the disengagement of average americans from the political process , i agreed with him through his analysis of the problem and the implications for our country until he got to a solution that americans' estrangement from politics could be fixed with a series of highprofile , nationally televised town hall meetings gathering typical americans in charged , televised exchanges using the townhall format is a recipe for more of the same superficial political exchanges the initial impulse to get more people across america talking is the right one but are we willing to do the hard work to make things right \? that means encouraging americans from all walks of life to get out of their houses and talk face to face with other community members in nonpartisan dialogue forums , in public meetings or in more informal gatherings these may be low profile , but this is what americans are yearning to do the last thing we need is another national tv spectacle ruth a wooden president , public agenda new york , oct 30 , 2006 to the editor i agree with bob herbert s description of the profound cynicism in america concerning politics and our electoral process this civic cynicism , however , breeds nonparticipation in the electoral process , and that only helps republicans why else would officials of the ruling party be in the forefront of every single effort to suppress voting rights \? they know that low voter turnout is good for them , and they will continue to do all they can to make sure that the system stays broken peter house seattle , oct 30 , 2006

two weeks before the government shut down a web site holding an archive of iraqi documents captured during the war , scientists at an american weapons laboratory complained that papers on the site contained sensitive nuclear information , federal officials said yesterday two documents were quickly removed the bush administration set up the web site last march at the urging of congressional republicans , who said giving public access to materials from the 48 , 000 boxes of documents found in iraq could increase the understanding of the danger posed by saddam hussein but among the documents posted were roughly a dozen that nuclear weapons experts said constituted a basic guide to building an atom bomb they were accounts of mr hussein s nuclear program , which united nations inspectors dismantled after the 1991 persian gulf war the site was shut down on thursday night after the new york times asked questions about the disclosure of nuclear information and complaints that experts had raised yesterday , federal officials said they were conducting a review to understand better how and when the warnings had originated and how the bureaucracy had responded the house democratic leader , nancy pelosi of california , called the posting of the weapons information a serious security breach , and other democrats called for an investigation the republican congressman who had led the campaign for the creation of the web site , peter hoekstra of michigan , questioned whether the government had received any serious warnings about the site , and said he had always stressed the need to take whatever steps necessary to withhold sensitive documents the complaints two weeks ago by the american weapons scientists , as outlined by federal officials yesterday , indicated for the first time that warnings about the site had come from the government s arms experts , as well as from international weapons inspectors a senior federal official , who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the subject , said scientists at the lawrence livermore national laboratory in california last month had protested some of the weapons papers on the site to the national nuclear security administration , an arm of the department of energy that runs the nation s nuclear arms laboratories the objections never perked up to senior management , the official said they stayed at the midlevels managers at the security administration passed the warning to their counterparts at the office of the director of national intelligence , which oversaw the web site , the official said as a result , a nuclear weapons expert said , the government pulled two nuclear papers from the web site last month he said the dangers of the documents had been recognized at livermore and in the wider community of government arms experts those two documents were on everybody s list , he said the first known protest about the site came last april , when united nations weapons inspectors lodged an objection with the united states mission to the united nations over a chemical weapons document , diplomats said it was removed after the site started posting nuclear documents in september , concern arose among united nations weapons inspectors in vienna and new york earlier this week , two european diplomats said that weapons experts at the international atomic energy agency concluded that they should warn the united states government of the dangers of posting the documents they said that olli j heinonen , head of safeguards at the agency , conveyed those concerns last week to the american ambassador to the agency , gregory l schulte but matthew boland , mr schulte s spokesman , said yesterday that the ambassador had received no warnings asked about that , one of the two european diplomats raised questions about whether mr heinonen had followed through even so , intelligence officials in washington said they were exploring whether the government had received warnings from united nations inspectors an official of national nuclear security administration said his agency would review the documents to the best of his knowledge , he added , none of them had been reviewed by his agency , which is the government s expert on nuclear secrets
a pair of ducks sat on the muddy shore of the neck river in madison last tuesday , oblivious to the environmental destruction taking place just under their feet vegetation in the salty marshes near long island sound is dying off , putting plants and animals at risk and causing the shore to erode scientists call it sudden wetland dieback , but they are not sure how it started and what they can do to end it to be sure , the problem is still relatively small , and it takes an expert to notice it the marshes at the neck river looked perfectly serene last week a family of ospreys had built a nest on a wooden post in the middle of the grass seagulls rested on a dock birds called to each other there were at least a half dozen different songs in the air none sounded like complaints but there it was , on the far side of the river from an old boat dock the dieback stretching from the water s edge a few feet onto land , it looked like male pattern baldness in reverse the land near the shore was bare , but higher up it was filled with grass and other plants these are very important areas where we 're seeing vegetation lost , said ron rozsa , a coastal ecologist for the connecticut department of environmental protection the problem is that various marine organisms depend on the cordgrass near the shore for shelter and sustenance small shrimp and fish and certain kinds of insects live there bigger fish , in turn , eat them without the cordgrass , those animals go away or die meanwhile , where grasses have ceased to grow , the soil begins to collapse , putting even more of the marsh in danger mr rozsa said there are about 13 , 000 acres of salty and partly salty marshes in connecticut he has recorded dieback from old lyme to as far west as milford he said he thought the phenomenon began in 1999 and it is not just occurring in connecticut scientists have noticed bare wetlands throughout new england , and even near orient point , on long island a similar effect was recorded in a handful of southern states , including louisiana , georgia and texas scientists in louisiana have linked it to a fungus , but connecticut is still testing to determine what causes the grass by the shore to die , mr rozsa said so far , scientists have just been floating theories , including blaming flying dust from sudan susan c adamowicz , an estuary scientist with the united states fish and wildlife service in maine , has worked to pool information about dieback in different states , but she said it was still disparate and incomplete there is no money to fully document it by taking lowaltitude aerial photographs , for instance and there is no organized plan to track it , just a few scientists with increasing concerns they held a conference on the problem this past may and keep in touch through an email group but some worry that they are facing too big a danger for halfmeasures it s not thousands of acres yet , dr adamowicz said , but it s scary because we do n't know what it is or how to stop it photo danger alert bare shore at the neck river signals a phenomenon scientists consider a peril to salt marsh life \( photo by thomas mcdonald for the new york times \)
robert altman has never won an oscar , something that seems a little hard to fathom after a career that included nashville , short cuts and gosford park the academy is trying to remediate history a bit this year by giving the 80yearold director an honorary oscar for his lifetime of work , which includes 86 movies the bagger visited with mr altman this summer on the set of prairie home companion , where he was directing the likes of meryl streep , tommy lee jones and , of all people , lindsay lohan the bagger sort of got the feeling that mr altman could care less that none of his five nominations resulted in the ultimate prize he was shooting the whole of his movie about garrison keillor s fictional account of an oldtimey radio show in under a month as soon as a scene was set up and the actors were somewhere near their marks , mr altman would shout , let s boogie , and the film would roll
my average day is actually pretty predictable when i m not out on an operation being a creature of habit i try to stick to the routine i have found it seems the more i repeat my endless iterations of eating , sleeping , working , and exercising , the faster the calendar pages flip now , it s not as if i am hating life out here on the contrary , the opportunity to have a positive impact during a pivotal point in our history is the type of stuff dreams are made of to help capture or kill my nation s enemies is just icing on the cake however , small , achievable goals make for a happy deployment i generally wake up at 0600 and start my morning fumbling with my sleeping bag zipper in a futile effort to free myself from the green sarcophagus that kept me so warm through the night this goes on for about 30 seconds until either i get lucky and it unzips or i just slide myself out of it in a fit of frustration after that i walk the 200 meters to the shower and then return to my trailer to get dressed to an itunes playlist of my choosing , usually of the angry variety metallica , pantera , dope , korn , rammstein , linkin park , megahertz , motley crue , three days grace , disturbed not exactly easy listening next , it s time for chow , so i walk 300 meters in the opposite direction to the little vegas chow hall at the edge of camp grizzly there i dine on a traditional american breakfast of eggs , biscuits , pork , and fruit juice the eggs are a tricky subject , because as of yet i have been unable to convince the chow hall workers that i only want a small portion of eggs it appears you will either get 18 ounces of eggs or you will get none at all this is not up for discussion , and any protest you make during the serving of your eggs will only elicit another 18ounce scoop from the now quickly depleting vat in front of you after finishing breakfast and discarding 15 ounces of eggs into the trash i return to my humble abode to take care of whatever business i might have before the day begins dropping off or picking up laundry , making a pot of coffee , or cleaning my living space by 0830 , i have traversed another 400 meters on foot to arrive at work there i will work until 1300 my roommate , boss , and i will then begin the long , 700meter pilgrimage back to the chow hall lunch is my shortterm goal of each day because after lunch things get much more relaxed once there , i immediately target the crystal light peach tea powder mix , and stuff at least three into my cargo pocket if we happen to go to the other chow hall on base i ll head for the nonrefrigerated liquid coffee creamer packets last , but not least , i procure a pineapple a whole pineapple this is really more for morale than consumption it was recently discovered that the pineapples offered at the chow hall are not only for decoration , but are free for the taking we re hoarding a stash of them back at work , with a monster pineapple party planned sometime in the near future if that doesn t work out perhaps we can build a unitsponsored trebuchet and host a pineapplechucking contest on a desolate portion of the base after our lunch , my roommate , who works midnight to noon , is done for the day he peels off at our trailer and i continue back to work for about an hour around 1500 , i take off to pt \( physical training , as in exercise \) but first i must return to my trailer to change clothes this usually wakes my roommate , who will then eye me with contempt for a second before dropping back into his afternoon hibernation next , i am out the door next , i am back in the door , because i forgot my room key this wakes my roommate , again , who is noticeably unhappier than before then i m off to the gym then i m back at my door , because i forgot to actually lock the door with my newly reacquired key as the bolt loudly slides into the latch i can imagine him inside the trailer pulling a blanket over his head in disgust after this complicated hullabaloo i can finally make my way to the gym , while my roommate plots my death in his dreams i have learned to modify my workout here time just doesn t allow for the program i followed back in camp pendleton i now work only one muscle group in 1520 minutes and then take off for a run i return to work about 1700 shortly thereafter my boss begins his nightly internet voice chat meeting with headquarters many comments and gestures must take place before the meeting can conclude these include the rolling of eyes , the hanging of heads in disgust , and the occasional removal of headphones due to annoying voices as this goes down i am sitting beside him checking email about 20 minutes into it he will usually remark that the meeting is killing his inner child i nod my head in agreement and we both trudge on if it goes 45 minutes or longer he may ask me to shoot him in the temple in an effort to end the pain , but i always assure him the meeting is almost over and we make it through together my boss , by the way , is the oic \( officer in charge \) of our detachment his name is captain drew fier \( pronounced fear \) and his stature matches his name after the meeting is over it s once again time for chow here we are on the lookout for crack cookies chocolate macadamia nut cookies that are addictive as crack it is at this point i must decide whether i have earned the pleasure of a crack cookie with rare exception the answer is yes after all , we don t call them crack cookies for nothing we leave the chow hall about 1945 at which point the issue of night vision becomes a problem emerging from a welllit building into the total darkness of a moonless night leaves you with the comfort factor akin to investing your retirement savings in the prophesy of miss cleo i now quickly retrieve my flashlight shifting my pineapple from arm to arm and use it for navigation , lest i stumble into a sandbag barrier finally , i make my way back to work one final time before returning to my trailer for the night around 2130 my roommate awakens , of course , but is somewhat relieved to know it s his last rousing of the night he s somewhat less relived , however , to see that it s about two hours until he has to get ready for work i crawl into my bag and read for about 20 minutes before deciding to give up the ghost by 2200 , i m asleep as visions of pineapples and crack cookies dance through my head artillery booms in the distance

taliban is not the word most kandaharis use for the militants mounting the current violence in southern afghanistan i have heard them called enemies or sometimes , more poetically , the spirits that come at night we had so much respect for taliban , said nurallah , a man who lives in a village a mile across the flat plain south of kandahar viewed from his house , the rock crests that form the city s northern bulwark cut the horizon in two , bulging solidly , creased and violetgray there were always three or four in a village , sleeping in the mosque , studying the book they had nothing the people would give them alms of bread , and they would sit of an evening and talk with us but no bad jokes or anything like that they were such clean men this is still the image the word taliban which means religious students conjures for many here and that is why the choice of the name was such a brilliant piece of psyops on the part of the organization that created the taliban movement in 1994 the pakistani military intelligence agency it was aided in its task by the credulity of many afghans , the desperation of others , and the opportunism of still others the taliban who are now gathered in a swath of villages west of kandahar contrast sharply with those nurallah remembers from his childhood far from being learned , most cannot even read kids , said a soldier who had cast an eye on the rippedup bodies his comrades were piling in a heap after american bombing ended a battle in may sixteen years old , 17 , 18 years old on a recent drive to kabul , a schoolboy i gave a lift to chattered about those who infest his village of shah jui they come down from the hills at night to collect food , 12 or 15 of them on motorcycles we give it to them we have to when abd alahad , sitting next to the boy in the back seat , asked if these taliban were men of the village , the boy shook his head they are unfamiliar to us he was not saying that the fighters were not , for the most part , afghans , just that they had come from somewhere else helmand province maybe , or urozgan he could tell by the way they talked genuine indigenous uprisings usually do not involve carefully quartering fighters away from their home villages now , as in 1994 , the arrival in numbers of these taliban resembles an invasion more than a revolt but invasion that advertises itself as such does not have a happy history in afghanistan so these recent forays have been orchestrated from across the pakistani border under shrewd camouflage it is afghans who organized , supplied and financed by others are invading their own country and so increasingly over the past three years , they have been able to secure the one asset without which they could not operate local complicity there are a number of reasons why southern afghan villagers offer a meal and a place to sleep in their mosque to a dozen armed and blackturbaned youths ideological hatred of america or christianity or western civilization is not one i have ever heard my friends here allude to kandaharis , though they believe implicitly and cleave painstakingly to the dictates of religious practice , are among the least ideological people i have encountered after surviving a communist coup and invasion , a chaotic civil war , a religiousbased revolution , and a westernled counterrevolution , all in less than a quartercentury , they are inoculated indeed , during those colorful , joyous days in early 2002 when kandaharis set aside their hardearned cynicism and mistrust and decided to throw in their lot with the karzai regime , they were anticipating the access it would give them to western civilization , which might finally hoist them up out of their decadeslong nightmare kandaharis want from their government much what we want from ours paved roads , schools , doctors with credentials so their prescriptions can be trusted not to poison patients , accountable public officials , some kind of say in the collective destiny , and perhaps above all , law and order any government , regardless of its stripes , that could provide these things would gain the adherence of the afghan people but with the exception of roads , the united statesbacked government of hamid karzai has provided almost none of these things according to friends working in kabul ministries as well as several officials here in kandahar , public office is for sale in afghanistan the highest bidder quickly makes back his investment in extracted bribes underpaid teachers often don t bother to show up at school , leaving student class monitors to lead the other children in lessons soldiers and police officers treat their fellow citizens with brutality and undisguised contempt , shaking them down at every opportunity when new checkpoints for catching taliban were set up in the villages west of town , for example , soldiers manning them systematically confiscated money and valuables from the passersby they searched we re caught in the middle , said zarghona one day plump , brighteyed zarghona , a member of my cooperative , draws her spare words up from the heart the taliban prey on us at night , and the government preys on us in the daytime nor do kandaharis feel they have much recourse from such everyday tyranny claiming they don t want to interfere , western officials are loath to demand accounts from men they helped usher into power in 2001 and the ballot box has proved of little more use to frustrated afghans during last year s parliamentary elections in kandahar , i would ask friends candidates as well as voters what they thought of the process the answer was unanimous a joke ! even winners used the word entire boxes full of ballots came in with a single name checked in the same color ink during the counting process , candidates representatives could get zeroes added to vote counts for a price kandaharis , their cynicism recovered by then , knew it would be so barely a quarter of those registered bothered to ink their fingers in this context , it is not entirely surprising that some people feel the only way to lodge a protest vote is to connive with the taliban , cooking up some extra okra , or vast , clothlike sheets of unleavened bread , and carrying the food across to unfamiliar men crouched in the mudplaster mosque especially when these men arrive in groups and armed with a police force that seems as hostile as the taliban themselves , what else are isolated , vulnerable villagers supposed to do \? of course , a few of those who aid the insurgents may be doing so for ideological reasons i suspect quite a few more are to use a local expression trying to stand on two watermelons that is , trying to maintain good relations with \( and obtain benefits from \) the government and taliban alike but it is my considered opinion that governance , that afterthought of so many exercises in nation building , is key to the security situation here if good governance had been the primary goal of the posttaliban regime , then none of the foreign troops currently out scouring the hills north of kandahar would have been needed afghans themselves would have denied militants entry to their villages
there are 108 licensed dogs in this village of 4 , 800 , but as so often happens elsewhere in the county and in communities far beyond , none of them are free to roam unleashed on public property that , however , is about to change the village is officially opening its first offleash , fencedin dog park today in a quarteracre plot at the corner of north evarts and winthrop avenues , a former staging site for transportation workers just off interstate 287 elmsford s mayor , robert williams , a selfdescribed dog lover who does not own a dog at the moment \( his last one , a shih tzu , died about a year ago \) , said the park was right in the middle of the village , which is nice , but it s also close to 287 , so it wo n't bother the people who say that dogs bark too much twothirds of the park s area is reserved for large breeds , while the rest is for small ones , he said the process of creating the dog park seems to have unfolded with none of the squabbles and controversy that have mired them elsewhere in pound ridge , dog owners have lobbied the town unsuccessfully for three years to designate a leashfree play area for dogs in greenburgh , the town board has not approved a proposal to construct a dog park , mainly because of liability concerns , said paul j feiner , the town s supervisor mayor williams said he was not worried about lawsuits in elmsford the village s insurance company will treat the dog park just like every other municipal park , he said if something happens to a dog or to a person , he said , it should be handled the same way as we handle a kid who falls off a swing the town s insurance rates will not rise because of the dog park , he said the village will ban violent dogs and allow only those who have had their shots to enter the park , mayor williams said he said the police would conduct spot checks of vaccination tags there are two other dog parks in westchester county , in ossining and in white plains , county officials said in white plains , which opened its dog park off belway place in 2004 , liability is assigned to the dog owners , who also play a role in keeping the park clean , said arne abramowitz , the city s commissioner of recreation and parks it s pretty much selfpolicing , mr abramowitz said if you do n't clean up after your dog , people will say , 'this is not appropriate , ' or 'this is gross and you should n't do it' the dog park has also become a popular spot for singles , especially on fridays , when dog owners meet and make dates for the weekend , he said mayor williams said that dozens of residents in elmsford had asked officials over the past two years to create a dog park last winter , the town picked the site , fenced it in during the spring and installed benches , a water fountain and garbage cans to collect dog waste , at a cost of less than 5 , 000 angela white , 37 , has two labrador retrievers , biscuit and donut , whom she keeps on a leash when she takes them for a walk ms white said that she , her husband , martin , and their two children planned to celebrate donut s 7th birthday today by taking the dogs to the park for their first free run since puppy school the dogs love icecream cake , so we 're going to have to bring a cake down , she said it should be a little party for our family , but if other dogs feel like it , they 're welcome to join in photo play angela and martin white with their 5yearold son , anthony , and their labrador retrievers biscuit , jumping , and donut in elmsford s dog park , which officially opens today \( photo by alan zale for the new york times \)

an internal staff report by the united states embassy and the military command in baghdad provides a sobering provincebyprovince snapshot of iraq s political , economic and security situation , rating the overall stability of 6 of the 18 provinces serious and one critical the report is a counterpoint to some recent upbeat public statements by top american politicians and military officials the report , 10 pages of briefing points titled provincial stability assessment , underscores the shift in the nature of the iraq war three years after the toppling of saddam hussein warnings of sectarian and ethnic frictions are raised in many regions , even in those provinces generally described as nonviolent by american officials there are alerts about the growing power of iranianbacked religious shiite parties , several of which the united states helped put into power , and rival militias in the south the authors also point to the arabkurdish fault line in the north as a major concern , with the two ethnicities vying for power in mosul , where violence is rampant , and kirkuk , whose oil fields are critical for jumpstarting economic growth in iraq the patterns of discord mapped by the report confirm that ethnic and religious schisms have become entrenched across much of the country , even as monthly american fatalities have fallen those indications , taken with recent reports of mass migrations from mixed sunnishiite areas , show that iraq is undergoing a de facto partitioning along ethnic and sectarian lines , with clashes sometimes political , sometimes violent taking place in those mixed areas where different groups meet the report , the first of its kind , was written over a sixweek period by a joint civilian and military group in baghdad that wanted to provide a baseline assessment for conditions that new reconstruction teams would face as they were deployed to the provinces , said daniel speckhard , an american ambassador in baghdad who oversees reconstruction efforts the writers included officials from the american embassy s political branch , reconstruction agencies and the american military command in baghdad , mr speckhard said the authors also received information from state department officers in the provinces , he said the report was part of a periodic briefing on iraq that the state department provides to congress , and has been shown to officials on capitol hill , including those involved in budgeting for the reconstruction teams it is not clear how many top american officials have seen it the report has not circulated widely at the defense department or the national security council , spokesmen there said a copy of the report , which is not classified , was provided to the new york times by a government official in washington who opposes the way the war is being conducted and said the confidential assessment provided a more realistic gauge of stability in iraq than the recent portrayals by senior military officers it is dated jan 31 , 2006 , three weeks before the bombing of a revered shiite shrine in samarra , which set off reprisals that killed hundreds of iraqis recent updates to the report are minor and leave its conclusions virtually unchanged , mr speckhard said the general tenor of the bush administration s comments on iraq has been optimistic on thursday , president bush argued in a speech that his strategy was working despite rising violence in iraq vice president dick cheney , on the cbs news program face the nation , suggested last month that the administration s positive views were a better reflection of the conditions in iraq than news media reports i think it has less to do with the statements we 've made , which i think were basically accurate and reflect reality , mr cheney said , than it does with the fact that there s a constant sort of perception , if you will , that s created because what s newsworthy is the car bomb in baghdad in their public comments , the white house and the pentagon have used daily attack statistics as a measure of stability in the provinces maj gen rick lynch , a senior military spokesman in baghdad , told reporters recently that 12 of 18 provinces experienced less than two attacks a day gen peter pace , the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff , said on the nbc news program meet the press on march 5 that the war in iraq was going very , very well , although a few days later , he acknowledged serious difficulties in recent interviews and speeches , some administration officials have begun to lay out the deeprooted problems plaguing the american enterprise here at the forefront has been zalmay khalilzad , the american ambassador , who has said the invasion opened a pandora s box and , on friday , warned that a civil war here could engulf the entire middle east on saturday , mr khalilzad and gen george w casey jr , the senior military commander in iraq , issued a statement praising some of the political and security goals achieved in the last three years , but also cautioning that despite much progress , much work remains
to the editor i urge congress to build a bipartisan group to end any plans president bush may have to bomb iran there are many important issues being debated at the moment , but none are as essential to national security as this we cannot continue to use military force whenever we do n't like what a country is doing , even if it is truly horrible what s worse is that we seem to do so only when the supposed threat takes place in an area where we have strategic interests , like oil we have yet to take any military action to stop the genocide in darfur although diplomacy may not work with iran , bombing will make things far worse , with consequences that may include nuclear strikes , hatred of america that grows exponentially , terrorism in the united states and potentially world war iii i am 41 years old , and for the first time in many years , i am scared our government must start to think more creatively about how to solve problems to continue to use military force will never bring about true security mary goldschmidt doylestown , pa , april 11 , 2006

disease often causes a bull seyeshaped rash near a tick bite it can spread through the body if left untreated , causing arthritis , cardiac irregularities and neurological problems reported cases have been increasing over the last decade , experts say , partly because of greater awareness of the disease there s either a real increase or an increase in recognition , and it s probably a combination of both , said dr steven e phillips , the immediate past president of the international lyme and associated diseases society the disease was first identified in the 1970 s in lyme , conn , thus giving it its name another expert , eddy bresnitz , the state epidemiologist in new jersey , where 3 , 372 cases were reported in 2005 , cited the increased proximity of humans to wildlife there s more and more suburbia constructed closer to parks and areas where there s increased vegetation , he said we have more deer and more deer ticks anyone who walks through leaf litter in the woods or on the edge of fields or lawns this time of year should check regularly for the nymphal stage of the tick , said durland fish , a professor of epidemiology at the yale school of medicine the size of a poppy seed , the tick spreads 95 percent of cases , dr fish said some prevention efforts appear to be working in hunterdon county in new jersey , the rate of reported cases fell almost by half , to 268 per 100 , 000 residents in 2005 from 554 in 1996 for comparison , the rate of lyme disease nationally in 2005 was 67 cases per 100 , 000 people , and it is 274 in the 12 eastern and midwestern states where it is most common , according to the centers for disease control and prevention hunterdon experienced an increase in the number of cases in the 1990 s after the completion of a section of interstate 78 in western new jersey in 1968 led to housing construction and more people moving into deer habitat , said john w beckley , director of the county health department he said some of the recent decline in lyme disease in the county might be attributable to public health efforts that included putting signs in county parks warning visitors to check for ticks distributing fliers about the disease to doctors' and veterinarians' offices , garden centers and schools and publishing a lymeometer in a local newspaper announcing the level of tick danger each week dr andrea gaito , a rheumatologist in basking ridge , nj , in neighboring somerset county , said in midmay that she was already seeing three to four new cases of lyme a week there s more awareness , that s what brings people in early , and that s the good news , she said it makes early diagnosis and treatment so much better as a result , she said , she is seeing fewer cases of chronic lyme disease , which she estimates account for 15 to 20 percent of cases kim uffleman , 49 , of rivervale , nj , in bergen county , suffers from the chronic form of the disease , which she contracted 17 years ago nine months after being bitten by a tick , she was bedridden , and it was two years before ms uffleman , who used to run almost 50 miles a week , could leave her house without help it took her too long , she said , to find a doctor who could give her a clear diagnosis , even though she had had the classic bull seye rash i grieve the loss of my health , and that i had to raise three children while being extremely ill , she said they know nothing except for a sick mother , and that s very difficult she still has headaches , back pain , fatigue , numbness in her hands and burning pain down her arms pat smith , president of the lyme disease association , a national nonprofit group based in jackson , nj , said her group had helped develop two bills now before congress that would provide 100 million for research , education and prevention , in part to develop a definitive diagnostic test people who receive an early diagnosis and treatment with antibiotics generally recover and do not develop chronic symptoms but diagnostic tests have only been about 50 percent accurate , ms smith said , adding that she has seen an increase in chronic cases since the disease was identified , because as the number of cases grows , the number of undiagnosed , misdiagnosed and slowly treated cases has also grown some people have to go to dozens of physicians before they get diagnosed , and people are getting delayed or inappropriate treatments , she said linda davis , 42 , of freehold , nj , in monmouth county , had misdiagnoses of multiple sclerosis and fibromyalgia , among other ailments , before learning she had lyme disease in 2003 she was using a wheelchair when she finally started receiving proper treatment her sons , austin hutcherson , 8 , and myles hutcherson , 6 , also have the disease none of us had the bull seye rash , she said after receiving antibiotics , they are all doing better , though they still have symptoms austin has gastrointestinal problems , and myles has chronic fatigue we try to keep everything normal , she said they 're always playing outside most people do n't even know they have lyme disease ms smith said the lyme disease association was also raising money for an endowed research center at columbia university devoted to chronic lyme disease and supported research into the genome of borrelia burgdorferi , the bacteria that causes lyme disease researchers at the university of medicine and dentistry of new jersey in newark are determining the genetic structure of 17 strains of the bacteria , with help from researchers at the institute for genomic research in rockville , md , stony brook university and the university of utah one new jersey researcher , dr steven schutzer , said , knowing the genetic sequence will help in diagnostics , and possibly different kinds of therapeutics despite concerns about the disease , mr beckley , the hunterdon county health officer , urged people to enjoy the outdoors you can go on as many hikes as you want through the woods , but stay on the path , he said if you must go off the path , you should tuck your pants in your socks , he said , and use insecticides or insect repellent and check for ticks on yourself , your children and pets after being outside photos kim uffleman , shown with her dog , topaz , has had chronic lyme for 17 years a sign at mine brook park in flemington , nj , warns hikers

as clusters of openhouse balloons bob across the suburbs of the metropolitan area , from the new englandy enclaves of fairfield county , conn , to the saltsprayed boroughs of the jersey shore , the question remains whither the housing market \? everyone , it seems , has an answer , and those answers can be strangely contradictory and accurate at the same time if inventory is your gauge , the market is slackening if prices are your prism , it s still going strong but in interviews with more than two dozen real estate agents , buyers , sellers and economists , the consensus is that the housing market in the region remains remarkably buoyant but is coming down to earth prices are still in the clouds , but inventory is expanding and bidding wars , once commonplace , are increasingly rare if the boom is over , there is no bust in sight it s turning , said pearl m kamer , chief economist for the long island association , the island s largest business organization it s neither a buyer s nor a seller s market buyers say they no longer feel pressured to make an offer the moment they step over the doorsill \( there are even isolated reports of some sellers getting lowball offers \) brokers , meanwhile , are lecturing sellers to be more realistic about prices , and sellers are working harder to spruce up their homes a few years ago , sellers were not making their beds and leaving dishes in the sink , and buyers were still coming and buying , said cindy derose , a sales agent for hudson shores realtors in irvington , ny it is still a healthy market but it has cooled down enough that sellers just have to do a little more work , frankly of course , the real estate market in the new york city suburbs has long had its ups and downs but over time , houses there have proved to be extraordinary investments because people want to be close to the city while enjoying the relative safety and good public schools the suburbs tend to offer though the pattern of contradiction in the current market seems fairly consistent from state to state , there are differences from one community to the next , with some towns appearing almost impervious to any downturn , at least for now frank anthony , a sales associate for coldwell banker in mendham , called the current market town sensitive he compared a cape cod in east hanover that was first listed for 539 , 000 and sat on the market for 80 days with a colonial in millburn that was listed for 775 , 000 and sold in two days mr anthony says he believes the market is still hot as long as three conditions are met nice house , nice location and nice price for all the talk of a bubble , prices do not seem ready to collapse or even edge south , with the exception of houses whose price tags were plainly inflated brokers say the 1 million mark seems to be a dividing line houses priced for less sell quickly , while houses listed for more are sitting longer and , in some cases , going for less than their list prices the most recent statewide real estate data for new york , new jersey and connecticut show that housing prices continued to appreciate late last year , but at a less breathless clip than the year before according to rae d rosen , a senior economist and assistant vice president for the federal reserve bank of new york , the growth rate in the price of an average house peaked at the same moment in all three states , the third quarter of 2004 new york state saw a 17 percent increase in sales prices for singlefamily houses , over the same quarter in 2003 connecticut , 15 percent and new jersey , 185 percent by comparison , in the last quarter of 2005 , housing prices in new york rose 126 percent over the year before , 119 percent in connecticut and 146 percent in new jersey westchester county s fourth quarter witnessed a more modest increase of 6 percent and some brokers say that housing prices may be leveling off it s like going from 60 miles per hour to 30 miles per hour , ms rosen said of the rise in prices we 're just decelerating it looks like the market is moving away from its peak armed with reports of an easing market and steeped in internet research , some buyers are heading to open houses with raised hopes , expecting to find a house or a condominium they can not only afford but also actually want to inhabit some are equating a softening market with falling prices they are often disappointed there does n't seem to be any rhyme or reason to this market , said claudia denatale , who recently toured a lackluster threebedroom condominium in huntington station listed for 425 , 000 there s been so much talk about the market changing , but i do n't see anything dramatic when you talk about a drop , it should be significant what many buyers do report is greater choice indeed , inventory tight as a noose since 2000 is up across the region , sometimes markedly on long island , the number of unsold houses in january stood at 23 , 470 , a 67 percent jump from the year before inventory in connecticut also rose in fairfield county , the number of houses for sale at the end of last year was 35 percent higher than in late 2004 inventories in some communities \( norwalk , easton , new canaan and darien \) were up more than 50 percent
to the editor readers of the review of catherine merridale s ivan s war \( april 9 \) are no more knowledgeable about why we should care about these men , the veterans of the red army in world war ii , than they were before they started it not once in her review does sheila fitzpatrick mention what we in the west owe them quite simply , the defeat of the wehrmacht nazi germany s war with the soviet union was fought chiefly on land , and by all measures firepower , casualties , scale it dwarfed the allied campaigns in europe and north africa western military historians are unanimous that the red army was responsible for at least 75 percent of all german losses in all theaters in both men and materiel it should also be remembered that by the time the allies landed on the beaches of normandy and opened a true second front , the wehrmacht had been in retreat since losing the critical tank battle of kursk to the red army in july 1943 , almost an entire year earlier none of this is mentioned in the review , which does , however , speak of the rapes and atrocities committed by soviet soldiers when they invaded germany all of that is true , but it is also true that it was the ordinary red army soldier , the ivan so disastrously underestimated by the german high command and so callously expended by his own , who changed the course of history we can only hope your readers go to merridale s splendid book to get a balanced portrait of these men , who saved this planet from fascism john garrard carol garrard john garrard is a professor of russian studies at the university of arizona the garrards edited world war 2 and the soviet people and wrote the bones of berdichev the life and fate of vasily grossman , about the red army s leading war correspondent
to the editor i am the mother of a 16yearold young man on the autistic spectrum although i do not agree with cammie mcgovern s hypothesis linking parental determination to achieve a cure to the tragic events she describes , i know many parents , including myself , who have hung onto hope that a certain treatment plan or therapist or school placement will somehow result in making my son normal none have , but max has developed beautifully and has made jumps of progress throughout his life , and i am proud of the young man he is today i have been blessed with many people who have recognized that emotional support for me and my family is perhaps the most important ingredient in this equation and who have provided that support to us , from pediatricians to therapists to teachers and , most important , friends if i die tomorrow , i am comfortable in the knowledge that max will live as independently as possible and will always be in touch with people who love him and appreciate his differences government and philanthropy , take note it is a whole lot easier to accept the absence of a cure when you know that your child will be embraced by others , despite his differences parents of children on the autistic spectrum need help developing these strategies as well barbara coccodrilli carlson brooklyn , june 5 , 2006 the writer is a former special education teacher
the academy of motion picture arts and sciences named crash the best film of the year sunday , turning its back on brokeback mountain , a film about the love affair between two gay men , which had dominated virtually every other movie award in the runup to the oscars ang lee , however , was the academy award for best director for brokeback crash , a film from the director paul haggis about a series of tense racial encounters in contemporary los angeles , appeared to gain momentum late in the oscar race , perhaps as a hometown favorite among academy voters the academy also honored some of hollywood s favorite actors as philip seymour hoffman was named best actor for inhabiting the role of truman capote and reese witherspoon won the best actress award for her performance as june carter cash in walk the line the 78th academy awards , like the year in film , seemed preoccupied with political and moral subjects george clooney won the oscar for best supporting actor for his performance in syriana as a cia agent caught between terrorists and his corrupt bosses and rachel weisz was named best supporting actress for her performance in the constant gardener , as a muckraking activist in kenya whose victimization by an evil pharmaceutical company rouses her emotionally deadened diplomat husband into action mr clooney , who acknowledged that we are a little bit out of touch in hollywood , said that once in a while that was probably a good thing and he returned the academy s compliment we were the ones who talked about aids when it was just being whispered we talked about civil rights when it was n't popular , he said i'm proud to be part of hollywood , proud to be part of the community and proud to be out of touch backstage moments later , mr clooney mused that hollywood was about two years late getting around to wrestling with the social and political issues confronting the nation it wo n't last very long , but we 've done this on and off , he said we did it in the 30 s , we did it in the 50 s , we certainly did it in the 60 s and 70 s , and we 'll probably continue to do that , which is reflect society , not truly lead it mr hoffman , accepting his oscar , congratulated his mother we are at the party , ma , he said a radiant ms witherspoon , too , thanked her parents it did n't matter if i was making a bed or making a movie , they never hesitated to tell me how proud they were of me , she said an exception to the dominance of political movies was the winner for best documentary feature , the march of the penguins the surprise hit bested a field that included documentaries on the scandal at enron and on a hardfought mayoral election in newark with jon stewart , of the daily show , as its host , this oscars telecast was bound to scald a little , and mr stewart had what were no doubt welcome barbs for republicans , perhaps less welcome ones for democrats , and plenty at the movie industry s expense he said that the singer bjork could not attend she was trying on her oscar dress , and dick cheney shot her he suggested that casting their academy ballots may well have been the first time many of you have ever voted for a winner and , in introducing terrence howard , who played a pimp in hustle flow who aspired to be a rapper , mr stewart defined a pimp as an agent with a better hat in fact it was the rap song of mr howard s character , it s hard out here for a pimp , by the memphis group three 6 mafia , that won the oscar for best original song mr stewart s narrow and young viewership on the cable network comedy central made him relatively unknown to the worldwide oscars television audience , but his court jester s combination of sarcasm and flattery seemed to work with the hollywood royalty in the room he said mr clooney s good night , and good luck was not just a movie but how mr clooney ends all his dates he assured steven spielberg that after schindler s list and munich , i think i speak for all jews when i say , i ca n't wait to see what happens to us next and mr stewart mocked both the show s theme , a return to glamour for too long hollywood has done without and the movie industry s obsession with piracy , pointing to its victims in the kodak theater there are women here who could barely afford enough gown to cover their breasts , he said while 2005 s movie calendar was short on polarizing events no one tackled the passion or excoriated the bush administration the way mel gibson and michael moore had the year before it was teeming with modest movies making small statements about important subjects the nominees for best picture , all but one of them from studio specialty divisions , alone bore evidence of hollywood s sudden case of seriousness capote and good night , and good luck cast a critical eye on the roles and responsibilities of journalists , crash explored racial animosity and challenged preconceptions , munich took on middle east violence , and brokeback mountain illustrated the pointblank impact of intolerance the lone bigstudio picture , munich , was made for some 75 million , more than twice the combined budgets of all four other nominees
this week i spent a happy tuesday afternoon doing one of the things i most like to do i was teaching or trying to teach a student how to write success in this area comes hard the occasion for the lesson was a final paper that displayed a range of organizational and grammatical problems i always begin on the level of sentences , but early on , it became clear that this student , who had turned 31 the day before , didn t have a firm grasp on what a sentence is i gave him my standard mantra a sentence is a structure of logical relationships but that didn t help what did help and usually helps , i find is a return to basics so basic that it is almost an insult i asked him to write a simple threeword english sentence he replied immediately jane baked cookies give me a few more with the same structure , i said he readily complied but one of his examples was , tim drinks excessively the next 40 minutes were spent getting him to see why this sentence was not like the others \( a kind of sesame street exercise \) , but he couldn t do that until he was able to see and describe the structure of sentences like , jane baked cookies i pointed to baked and asked him what function the word played he first tried to tell me what the word meant no , i said , the word s meaning is not relevant to an understanding of its function \( meaning is always the enemy of writing instruction \) i want to know what the word does , what role it plays in the structure that makes the sentence a sentence and not just a list of words he fumbled about for a while and finally said that baked named the action in the sentence right , i replied , now tell me what comes along with an action someone performing it , he answered and in the sentence , who or what is performing the action \? jane , he said happily great ! now tell me what function the word cookies plays progress immediately stalled for a long time he just couldn t get it he said something like , cookies tells what the sentence is about no , i said , that s content and we re not interested in content here \( content is always the enemy of writing instruction \) what i want to know is what structural relationship links cookies to the other parts of the sentence more confusion i tried another tack what information does cookies provide \? what question , posed implicitly by another of the sentence s components , does it answer \? it took a while , but that worked it answers the question , what was baked \? he offered yes , i said , you ve almost got it now explain in abstract terms that would be descriptive of any sentence with this structure , no matter what its content or meaning , the structural logic that links a word like baked , a word that names an action , to a word like cookies more fumbling , but then he said cookies is what is acted upon by god , he got it ! it was only then that i told him that in the traditional terminology of grammar , the thing acted upon is called the object had i given him the term earlier , he would have nodded , but he wouldn t have understood a thing now , he had at least the beginning of an understanding of how sentences are constructed and what work a sentence does it organizes relationships between actors , actions and things acted upon we still had to deal with tim drinks excessively , but at least there was something to build on does excessively name what is acted upon by the action drinks \? no , he replied what , then does it do \? a relapse into content it tells what s happening that s what drinks does , i reminded him what information , in relation to drinks as a word with a specific function , does excessively provide \? it was coming more quickly now it tells us in what way he drinks , he said yes , the function of excessively , and of any other word occupying the same structural slot , is to tell you something about the manner in which an action is performed oh , he said , an adjective no , an adverb , i replied , but the term is less important than your understanding of the structural role does that mean , he asked , that the adverbial role can be played by more than one word , by many words \? now we were rolling i drove home the point of the lesson so far by asking him two simple questions how many sentences , with different contents , are there that display the structures actoractionacted upon or actoractionmanner of action \? an infinite number , he replied how many forms of the two structures are there \? only one , he said now you know , i told him , that form comes first , content second if you grasp the abstract structural form of sentences like these , you can produce millions of them you can organize any content whatsoever by imposing on it the logic of these forms the next exercise was considerably more sophisticated , but he completed it more quickly write a sentence that begins with the phrase even though no problem at all he produced a bunch of them , including , even though i stayed up all night , i wasn t tired how many even though sentences exist out there , i asked again , an infinite number and how many forms \? one now came the hard part describe that form without reference to any particular content describe , that is , the structure of every even though sentence ever written he quickly saw that the answer lay in the relationship between the two clauses \( which he called phrases \) , but he had a hard time saying what the relationship was he came up with the idea of contradiction but agreed that contradiction was too strong he thought about it some , and settled on a word he was familiar with as a law student the second clause , he said , is a rebuttal of the first almost there what does it rebut \? it rebuts , he replied , what you would expect to follow from the first clause you mean , i said \( offering more help than i should have , but the afternoon was disappearing \) , that the second clause undoes in some way the expectation produced by the first he acknowledged that this is what he meant what if the sentence read , even though i stayed up all night , i was tired oh , he replied , that wouldn t be a good even though sentence because the second part would say exactly what you would have expected it to say how about if the sentence were just , i stayed up all night i wasn t tired what would the difference be \? he got it immediately you wouldn t know from the beginning that the expectation produced by the first part is going to be disappointed isn t a sentence that begins with notwithstanding somewhat like an even though sentence , he wondered you bet ! end of the second lesson , except for my pointing out to him that while he always knew how to generate even though sentences and was capable of identifying misuses of the form , he now was able to describe the form and understand precisely how it works my assumption in all of this and it is not an assumption i have yet proved empirically is that this analytical alertness to form , this ability to recognize forms and know when they are properly or improperly deployed , would translate into a greater alertness to the operations of form in his own writing before he left , late for dinner , i gave him what was in effect a final exam for the day you now know , i said , that one basic english sentence form is a structure of relationships in which words and phrases fill the slots of actor , action and thing acted upon what words and phrases , i asked him , fill those slots in this sentence \? helping old ladies cross the street prevents accidents he regressed and told me that the action in the sentence was helping no , you re making the mistake \( which many people make \) of thinking that when you identify the part of speech a word or phrase is , you ve identified its function these are two entirely different matters it is true that helping is a verbal form , but it is not the sentence s verb what about the actor \? old ladies , he replied \( as students always do \) same mistake , i told him old ladies is a noun phrase , but that fact tells you nothing about its function you re doing content again who or what is doing the acting \? ah , he responded , helping is doing the acting yes , even though it is a verbal form , it functions as the subject , a term , i hastened to add , that has nothing to with what the sentence is about subject is an entirely formal notion , and refers only to logical relationships , not to content now it went quickly if helping is the actor , what s the action \? prevents , he replied right , and what s being acted upon \? accidents you can go home before he left , however , i gave him an assignment take jane baked cookies or some other sentence of the same structure and build it up and out into a sentence of at least 100 words without losing control of the sentence s basic structure that is , you should be able to describe the relationship between the words and phrases you add and the sentence s core structural logic , a logic your additions and elaborations must honor and preserve the hard part will not be doing it , but explaining to me and to yourself exactly what you did explaining , that is , the functional role of everything you add the next day i spoke with him on the phone , and he told me that he woke up in the middle of the night and began to work on producing the baggy monster sentence i had requested moreover , he said , he was excited and happy to be doing so even though it was anything but easy happy birthday ! the large point i want to make is a point i tried to make in a new york times oped piece of last year the focus of writing instruction should be form , and only form the moment an idea or piece of content is allowed to take center stage \( except as an illustration of an abstract formal operation \) is the moment when the game is lost some readers of that oped piece were properly skeptical and feared that i was urging a series of arid exercises that could not possibly engage the interest of any student i have not found this to be true there is nothing arid about this way of teaching writing , although i acknowledge once again that the question of whether or not it actually does teach writing remains open it should be noted that none of the more substantive , contentbased approaches to the task seem to teach writing at all we ve now had decades of composition courses in which students exchange banal opinions about the hotbutton issues of the day , and student writing has only gotten worse doesn t it make sense to think that if you are trying to teach them how to use linguistic forms , linguistic forms are what you should be teaching \?
a raft of writers have come to the defense of ian mcewan , the english author who has been accused of copying phrases from a 1977 memoir for his 2001 bestselling novel atonement , but none more surprising than the famously reclusive thomas pynchon an article today in the daily telegraph , the london newspaper , says that mr pynchon sent a letter in support of mr mcewan , who has acknowledged using the memoir , no time for romance by lucilla andrews , as a source for his novel the letter argues that contemporary accounts are required resources for historical fiction for mr mcewan to have put details from one of them to further creative use , the letter , which was posted on the telegraph s web site , says , acknowledging this openly and often , and then explaining it clearly and honorably , surely merits not our scolding , but our gratitude a spokeswoman for penguin press , mr pynchon s publisher , said she had not heard about the letter a message left with mr pynchon s agent was not returned campbell robertson
first , i will continue along that theme i started yesterday i will no longer make any predictions on the other hand , it is a bit too easy to point out that way back in hungary in august when asked who i thought would win the title , i said fernando alonso yesterday it was in despair at what i thought was an evil turn in the championship that i predicted disaster at the first corner and a michael schumacher victorious and here we are the next day and schumacher is the one who had the disaster and alonso proved that he is a mean and wicked driver \( in the slang sense \) who is equal to the man he may supplant as king at the next race \( equal on the track , i mean \) and i continue to hope that my other observation , repeated several times on this blog , comes true again that invariably in recent years when it has appeared that the leader of the championship has been unjustly penalized , he goes on to win anyway i will now return to the more lighthearted and informative weekend roundup notes bit i have done a few times over the season  french television commentators reported this weekend that pierre dupasquier , the legendary director of michelin motorsport who retired last year , said that he did not know what had got into the minds of the renault team or even michelin , presumably when in china they changed only the front tires on alonso s car he said that he would never have advised such a change , that the front tires are far too important in terms of the balance of the whole and that all tires had to be changed or none at all dupasquier said they had occasionally , but rarely , opted to change only the rear tires , but that they were less important for the driving balance of the whole my friend and colleague agn s carlier just sent me the news that dupasquier will be awarded the legion d honneur by the french sports minister , jeanfran ois lamour , in the first week of december at michelin s headquarters in clermontferrand , not long before the fia prize ceremony in monaco probably the only people who do not miss dupasquier in formula one are the bridgestone teams and even they probably miss his important influence and great personality inside the paddock  agn s also provides an interesting quote from a vice president of toyota , kazuo okamoto , about the new toyotaowned fuji international speedway which will host the japanese grand prix starting next year we have the contract for five years we will not allow any f1 grand prix to come back to suzuka during this period that we consider as an exclusivity , even if it is called grand prix of asia or grand prix of the pacific  finally , this bit from agn s as well , which shows that toyota still has a great sense of occasion toyota , agn s reported , set up a shop in the public area at suzuka where you could have your nails done up with the panasonic toyota red logo the queue was huge and the shop was the most popular of all the merchandising stands

barbaro , a dark bay who wintered in florida , is trained by a relative newcomer to thoroughbred racing who has an olympic background lawyer ron is a chestnut who will arrive in kentucky by way of louisiana and arkansas his trainer is a lowkey 71yearold still seeking his first victory in the kentucky derby after 53 years in the business brother derek is a californiabred , californiaraced bay whose trainer has not missed a beat after being paralyzed in a july 2004 motocross accident the three favorites for the kentucky derby on saturday seem to have little in common , that is , until examining their records none have been beaten this year it s going to be an awful lot of fun when they get there , when they finally meet , said michael matz , the trainer of barbaro and an accomplished equestrian who won a silver medal at the 1996 olympics that s what horse racing is about , is n't it \? i do n't think it s just up to those three horses there are a lot of other horses that could run good , and i think that s the exciting part when it s way up in the air , nobody knows who s going to win the threesome is a combined 10 for 10 this year , with each horse dominating the derby preps in his respective region of the country throw in the lightly raced but talented showing up , who is unbeaten in three career starts , all of them this year , and there are four horses in the derby who have not lost in 2006 you have to go back to the 1978 kentucky derby to find anything comparable that is the year affirmed , alydar and sensitive prince came in with unblemished records as 3yearolds affirmed went on to win the triple crown i think it really is going to be tougher to win this derby than most because there are a lot of horses that are coming into it that are undefeated , said lawyer ron s trainer , bob holthus , who has not won the derby in four attempts there are some who are undefeated lifetime and that s not usually the case i think smarty jones was the exception to that this year , there seems to be a very strong field , and a lot of them have good records of the socalled big three in the derby , lawyer ron was the least likely to sweep a series of preps he struggled so much last year that holthus dropped him into a maiden claiming race , which he lost by a neck he did not get things turned around until holthus got him onto dirt tracks lawyer ron had made seven of his first eight starts on the grass or the synthetic polytrack surface at turfway park he started off his 3yearold campaign with an eightandaquarterlength romp in the risen star stakes at louisiana downs and has since won three consecutive kentucky derby preps at oaklawn park when we finally got him on the dirt , he just matured into a racehorse , holthus said he s been a man ever since brother derek was a quality 2yearold who capped his 2005 season with a victory in the grade i hollywood futurity but he has been even better as a 3yearold he began this year with a victory over the 2yearold champion stevie wonderboy in the san rafael stakes and has since won the santa catalina and the santa anita derby he s kept developing and getting stronger and just seems to improve after every race , brother derek s trainer , dan hendricks , said from his first start , barbaro appeared to have a bright future , but as a grass horse he raced only twice as a 2yearold , winning two grass races he made his 3yearold debut on the turf in the jan 1 tropical park derby and won easily knowing that there is more money to be made and more fame to achieve in dirt races than in grass races , matz switched barbaro to the dirt for the holy bull stakes on feb 4 at gulfstream park he won that day by threequarters of a length and followed with another dirt victory , in the florida derby showing up , not expected to be among the favorites in the race , has victories in a maiden race , an allowance race and the lexington stakes at keeneland like barbaro , lawyer ron and brother derek , he has done nothing wrong this year in an unusual year , that will not be enough to make him the favorite , a role that will probably fall to brother derek i agree that our horse should be one of the favorites , hendricks said of brother derek but it s hard to separate barbaro , lawyer ron and myself , and that s what the betting public will have to do it looks like a real competitive derby
senator john mccain gave two speeches today that offered his view of what lessons should be drawn from the republican losses in last week s midterm elections lots of politicians are giving lots of speeches these days , but these were worth paying attention for three reasons 1 \) they came on the day that mr mccain filed his papers establishing a presidential exploratory committee 2 \) they were made before two conservative audiences , a segment of the republican party with which mr mccain has had sometimes testy relations 3 \) mr mccain s aides said these were speeches to pay attention to , and this early in a campaign , that is often good for us in the arizona senator s view , the outcome last week was not an endorsement of democratic policy positions the party offered none , he said but rather a deserved repudiation for a republican establishment that spent too much time in washington and became part of the status quo voters , he said , had concluded that republicans had abandoned their principles on issues like spending and were guilty of the worst sin in american politics hypocrisy , my friends , is the most obvious of political sins and the people will punish it , he said at the federalist society , a conservative legal group we were elected to reduce the size of government and enlarge the sphere of free and private initiative we increased the size of government in the false hope that we could bribe the public into keeping us in office he added we lost our principles and our majority and there is no way to recover our majority without recovering our principles first later , at gopac , the conservative political action committee , he was planning to offer an attack on earmarking watch that be a big part of any mccain campaign for the white house as well as renew his call to send more troops to iraq , a reiteration of one of the more unorthodox positions mr mccain has adopted in this campaign without additional combat forces , we will not win this war , he said in remarks prepared for delivery mr mccain said he would ask a young marine to go to iraq to fight a war that he said was just what i cannot do is ask him to return to iraq , to risk life and limb , so that we might delay our defeat for a few months or a year that is more to ask than patriotism requires
to the editor re religion trumps regulation as legal exemptions grow \( in god s name series , front page , oct 8 \) surely , there are deeply reflective and soulsearching conversations going on around the country , as there are in my house as a country unabashed by our faith , we must also remember the spirit of our founders , who provided for that faith to flourish these many years your diligent reporting has not led us to any easy reconciliation of these matters of national , spiritual and political conscience you have simply helped set the terms for engaged citizens to pursue this needed dialogue andrew zitcer philadelphia , oct 11 , 2006 to the editor your series about religious accommodations in the law \( front page , oct 811 \) paid too little attention to the principled justifications for many of these accommodations and exemptions consider the tax benefit for clergy housing , discussed in the last installment \( religionbased tax breaks housing to paychecks to books , oct 11 \) even without this special provision , some clergy \( like catholic priests \) who live in employerprovided housing would be entitled to exclude the cost of that housing under general principles of tax law that have nothing to do with religion our legal tradition , however , rightly resists treating some religions more favorably than others simply because of formal theological differences among them hence , the parsonage exemption extends to all clergy the treatment that some clergy would deserve anyway the series also suggested that religious exemptions are part of an agenda to weaken the separation of church and state to the contrary , it has often been strict separationists on the supreme court , most notably william j brennan jr , who insisted for many years over the dissents of william h rehnquist and others that such exemptions were often constitutionally required the bottom line is that not all religious accommodations are alike some exemptions deserve closer , more critical scrutiny but most either seek to alleviate specific , profound conflicts between secular law and religious belief , or to guarantee aspects of constitutionally protected institutional religious autonomy , or to promote the equal treatment of different faith traditions these justified exemptions are not just favors or breaks , nor do they even come close to threatening the separation of church and state rather , they reflect and enforce the deepest implications of that separation perry dane wynnewood , pa , oct 11 , 2006 the writer is a professor at the rutgers school of law , camden to the editor if those pushing for taxes to be applied to taxexempt nonprofits get their way , it will ultimately cost americans far more than the present arrangement one of the reasons taxes are higher in many european countries is that they do not have the same vigorous nonprofit sector america has taxing nonprofits in america will eventually kill this sector , and the government will take over the provision of the services \( at a higher cost \) , or america will become a nation with a much more primitive quality of life monte sahlin burtonsville , md , oct 11 , 2006 to the editor re where faith abides , employees have few rights \( front page , oct 9 \) and the rabbi who lost his job after more than 30 years of service because of a diagnosis of parkinson s disease the current congregational president is right that religious institutions have to provide protections by contract but members of the clergy are in a difficult position when it comes to advocating for themselves , for they must step out of their roles as spiritual leader and giver to protect themselves and their families as a negotiator who represents clergy members in their contract negotiations , and as a member of a rabbinic family , i have come to believe that ministers and rabbis should seek , and their congregations should welcome , representation in negotiation , which helps protect the clergycongregation relationship martha hausman newton , mass , oct 11 , 2006 to the editor civil courts denying catholic nuns the right to sue for wrongful dismissal from church institutions are only part of the story \( front page , oct 9 \) for nearly two millenniums , nuns have n't received equal treatment even under church law nuns by definition are lay people who share the specific rights of laity but none of the ecclesiastical authority of ordained priests and bishops all the while , they have worked largely in church institutions controlled entirely by male clerics their male superiors could , and did , hire and fire a nun who felt mistreated might appeal her fate , but her peers , nuns , have no final say in the matter this paradox has produced controversies and protests against alleged arbitrary rule though nuns carried the major workload of american catholicism for decades , they were n't supported financially by the bishops or dioceses as ordained men had always been nuns earned their own keep , sometimes barely so when their numbers began dropping rapidly and the numbers of retired nuns grew sharply , scarce funds grew scarcer only after the desperate plight of many of these retirees made headlines did the hierarchy get involved on a limited basis

when modern art first arrived en masse in america , back in 1913 , with the armory show in new york , many of the artists were decried as lying dirty tricksters those young europeans called it art , but american critics and the public thought it was just nonsense every generation of artists has its own avantgarde , even if the historical notion of an avantgarde as an oppositional force against an entrenched orthodoxy is no longer applicable the uncritical absorption of most contemporary art into the mainstream scene has meant , in effect , that the once oppositional has become the establishment being avantgarde , these days , is not so much about making art in opposition to a dominant and domineering academy , which , strictly speaking , would mean returning to recherch \? tyles like portraiture or landscape it is more elusive and intangible , and often about a certain skepticism and ironical attitude toward authority and accepted truth for example , there is a small but effective group of artists whose work is simply to give stuff away for free food , art posters , etc many people have a hard time accepting what they do as art , for the artists do n't play along with the economic logic of the system you make , you show and you sell but in so far as their work seeks to undermine consumer culture , it might rightly be considered avantgarde counterfeiters , like zo \? heehan salda \? who recently had an exhibition of her reverse shoplifting at real art ways in hartford , are in an even more precarious position , for their activities frequently skirt the boundaries of the law but in both cases these sorts of artists are engaged in activities that , in intent , if not name , approximate something of the old avantgarde similarly , nate larson s artworks , showing at real art ways this month , may also be referred to as avantgarde his exhibition , charlatans and tricksters , consists of a series of narrativebased quasidocumentary blackandwhite photographs of the supernormal more accurately , they are forgeries of socalled paranormal events much of photography s credibility as a popular art form relies on its promise of visual truth , embodied in the axiom that the camera never lies seeing , you might say , is believing but the camera does lie , and frequently , and it is from this starting point that mr larson begins to craft his elaborate photographic fictions his images , radically , work a tension between a desire to believe and the skeptical rational mind mr larson s photographs are meant to be read in an order , from left to right , like language but it does not really matter how you look at them each depicts the artist in white shirt and striped tie posing as a sort of everyman experiencing supernatural occurrences the experiences range from being stalked by a shadow person to taking psychic photographs each of the 12 display images is a composite of several images relating to the experience much like a performance artist , mr larson treats the documentation of the experience as the artwork each of these composite images tells a little story , showing or telling us how and often where the socalled paranormal events took place in this way , he creates the pretense of providing factual information none of this , of course , is real , although that is hardly the point we believe it is real , given the apparent authenticity of the images and their documentary presentation but simultaneously our mind knows that the things we are looking at are invented it is this disconnect of image and reality that makes these photographs so fascinating mr larson is not the only artist to stake out this territory a recent exhibition at the neuberger museum of art in purchase , ny , surveyed a genre of new photography characterized by fabricated melodrama setup situations in which the artist or actors feign emotional intensity for the camera formally , mr larson s photography fits very much within this emerging tradition paranormal photography also has myriad historical precedents we might point to spirit photographs by late 19thcentury artists in england and france , many of whom were in fact reallife tricksters and charlatans mr larson is just pretending , his psychicallyattuned photographs surveying the limits of belief and truth nate larson charlatans and tricksters is at real art ways , 56 arbor street , hartford , through jan 29 information www realartways org or \( 860 \) 2321006 photos blackandwhite photographs of the supernormal by nate larson now at real art ways in hartford include telepathy , upper left , shadow person , above and knife eye

he said that s unbelievable i ca n't believe in this day and age it s something that has come up i'm driving and thinking about it , and it makes me mad the object of cashman s anger was the talk last week about omar minaya , the mets' general manager , and his growing collection of hispanic players it seems that some people have taken exception to minaya s acquisitions , charging that because he is latin , he is latinizing the mets it s funny , but white anglosaxon general managers have not been accused of americanizing their teams a survey of a halfdozen general managers found none who thought minaya had sought only latin players i deal with him a lot , bill bavasi of seattle said i have n't made a deal with him , but he s come after me for sexson , and at various times he s been interested in reed he s probably happy with his catching , but he 'd probably have been happy if johjima had visited new york johjima was planning on going there , but we made the best preemptive strike we could first baseman richie sexson and center fielder jeremy reed are white americans kenji johjima is a japanese catcher whom the mets were interested in before he signed with the mariners , and the mets traded for paul lo duca , an american catcher would you blame him if he had interest in felix hernandez \? bavasi said , referring to his sensational 19yearold venezuelan pitcher i'm a guy who worked my tail off to get carlos delgado minaya beat bavasi to delgado , one of six latin players the mets have traded for or signed this winter but just as carlos beltran was the best hitter and pedro mart \? z the best pitcher available last winter , delgado was the best hitter on the market , via trade or free agency , this year in other words , minaya went after the best players available , and they just happened to have been latinos omar s a talent guy , said pat gillick , the philadelphia phillies' general manager , who recruited a lot of latin players when he worked for the toronto blue jays he sees talent , and he goes after it minaya has gone after it with fred wilpon s money as diligent and as shrewd as he may be , minaya could not have acquired his latin stars if wilpon had n't been willing to subsidize his efforts unlike arte moreno , the angels' owner , wilpon is not hispanic if he did n't like having these latin players on his team , they would n't be there he approved the expenditures but wilpon wants to win , and minaya has put together a team that has a chance to win his arsenal includes mart \? z , beltran , delgado , jorge julio , julio franco , jose valentin , xavier nady and duaner sanchez it also includes billy wagner , a virginian , whom minaya preferred as the closer over the hispanics jose mesa and octavio dotel it does not include the cuban danys baez in setup relief because minaya refused to give up the indianan aaron heilman for him minaya also let roberto hernandez , a latino who was the mets' setup man , go as a free agent minaya , major league baseball s first and only latin general manager , could have signed a latin catcher , ramon hernandez or bengie molina , but he chose to trade for lo duca instead but when minaya traded kris benson to baltimore for julio , none of those developments mattered benson s irrepressible wife , anna , said minaya wanted to create an alllatin team sports talk radio shows picked up on the idea and made it a hit topic of discussion last week it sounds like talkradio fodder , mark shapiro , the cleveland general manager , said at this time of year , they 're looking to fill time i know omar well i respect him greatly he s driven to win he s not driven to getting any type of players but a winning type of players he s tireless , creative j p ricciardi , the toronto general manager , said the charge that minaya wanted only latin players was ludicrous and unfair i 've known omar for a long time , ricciardi said we both played in the minor leagues we started scouting together i 've seen omar draft a lot of different types of players i do n't think any of us are stupid enough to sit here and say , 'i'm going to sign white players or spanish players' there are not enough good players to do that you ca n't be in this job and have a narrow mind cashman echoed ricciardi s views , saying general managers did not operate the way critics said minaya did we 're required to put the best team on the field , and we 're going to be judged on those decisions , cashman said i think it s a lot ado about nothing it s unfortunate in the past two years , the detroit tigers signed three premier latin players ivan rodriguez , carlos guillen and magglio ord \? but general manager dave dombrowski said he never heard anyone accuse him of wanting to latinize the tigers we 're focused on trying to win , he said when you 're trying to win , you 're trying to get the best players possible it does n't matter where they come from minaya said he did not care where his players came from , either
george will joins the chorus against the lineitem veto \( which president bush has asked congress to give him \) in his washington post column it would aggravate an imbalance in our constitutional system that has been growing for seven decades the expansion of executive power at the expense of the legislature this ongoing development has been driven by wars hot and cold , and by today s , which is without a foreseeable end will also suggests that the idea is unconstitutional and , on top of that , wouldn t do anything to reduce spending \( and might even make it worse \) in timesselect , bruce bartlett agrees no one should delude themselves into thinking that the lack of a presidential lineitem veto is all that stands between us and a balanced budget the lineitem veto has proven to be a surprisingly unpopular idea in opinionland libertarianminded chicago tribune columnist steve chapman wrote last week that a lineitem veto by itself does nothing to curb fiscal indiscipline it s not the equivalent of pouring all your booze down the drain it s more like buying a bottleemptying machine so you can pour some of it out at some future date you get credit for taking action to reduce outlays , without antagonizing all the people who get upset when you actually reduce outlays chapman agrees with will that giving the president additional power over congress could actually increase spending suppose bush , armed with a lineitem veto , wanted to force congress to approve more spending for , say , his medicare prescriptiondrug program one way to coerce individual members to go along is to threaten to kill projects in their home districts fortythree governors possess some version of the lineitem veto , reason magazine s brian doherty noted last month the power , extent and importance of this power in curbing statelevel spending has been studied and argued over by political scientists for years the evidence is inconclusive , with overall effects on spending estimated to be either small , nonexistent , or dependent on situations where opposing parties control the two branches and the opposition is unable to overturn the governor s vetoes doherty s conclusion the problem with checks and balances on spending nowadays is that , in the overall picture \( there will always be small individual exceptions \) , the two branches are essentially balancing in the same direction toward more spending earlier this week in the wall street journal , bartlett advanced a different case against the lineitem veto it s not necessary congress could just restore impoundment authority , which gives the president the power to choose not to spend money that he deems is unnecessary an authority that congress took away in the budget act of 1974 \( calling for the repeal of the budget act of 1974 has become something of a hobbyhorse on the right recently \) bartlett writes according to constitutional scholar louis fisher , many presidents impounded money for public works and defense projects while congress complained , it did not challenge the president s right to impound this began to change in 1972 , when richard nixon began aggressively vetoing appropriations bills to get the exploding budget under control and help ease inflationary pressures after congress overrode his veto of a water pollution bill , treasury secretary george shultz declared that nixon would henceforth impound the funds in excess of what he asked for this enraged the democratic congress in january 1973 , it began moving legislation to take away the president s impoundment power that it thought this necessary confirms that congress saw the power as constitutional otherwise , legislators would have challenged it in the courts but restoring impoundment authority wouldn t resolve the objection by lineitem veto opponents that the idea just gives the president too much power as bradford plumer writes at mother jones s mojo blog t he only real appeal of the veto lies in its political potential clinton occasionally used his power to punish uncooperative republicans by denying them local projects , as when he struck down tax breaks for idaho potato farmers , just to stick it to one of his more vocal opponents , sen larry craig this president could do the same he could , for instance , influence congressional races by denying democrats the ability to win votes back home through earmarks , while allowing republicans to pork out to their hearts content what would stop him \? there are defenders of the lineitem veto out there matthew yglesias calls it at least an okay idea , the los angeles times editorial page supports it , and the washington post editorial page says bush s specific proposal for the idea is so good that it has made the post reverse its opposition to the lineitem veto well , sort of the post says what bush is asking for isn t a lineitem veto after all , but a responsible alternative to that unconstitutional proposal we have repeatedly opposed the idea of a lineitem veto so it may seem inconsistent to warmly endorse as we do president bush s proposal this week for what he terms the legislative line item veto act of 2006 in fact , though , mr bush is embracing a responsible alternative to the lineitem veto , which the supreme court struck down in 1998 his bill raises none of the constitutional problems of the earlier law nor does it raise the same concerns about concentrating power in presidential hands mr bush s idea does not so alter the checks and balances between the legislative and executive branches under his proposal , the president could not nix part of a spending bill he could , however , temporarily freeze a spending item and request that congress rescind it congress would be obliged to act on such requests quickly , without amendment and with no possibility of filibuster if a majority of both houses of congress stood by the provision , the president s action would have no consequence if , on the other hand , the spending were a single member s pet project a bridge in alaska , say congress as a whole might not stand by it the bill , in other words , gives the president not a lineitem veto but a device for forcing individual votes on line items buried within larger spending packages

as part of our cowboysgiants lollapalooza weekend , we ll post some snippets and links of coverage from around the nation this entry focuses on the dreaded playersonly meeting a close cousin of the dreaded vote of confidence from don banks of sicom headline new york is on the brink a loss would push it over excerpt their 65 record and butt ugly threegame losing streak aside , you knew the giants had reached the desperation stage this week when the news came that they had called the dreaded players only team meeting , always the last resort of a club whose season has been pushed to the brink it s the football equivalent of whipping out the defibrillator paddles and administering a quick electric shock to the heart of a locker room if it works , you can bring a season back to life and save the day but if it doesn t , it s just another empty and futile gesture along the road to ruin if they lose , could it come unraveled for the giants as quickly as everyone has said it could \? said randy cross , the former 49ers offensive lineman and veteran nfl game analyst for cbs yeah if you re a pessimist , right now you could say eli manning has fish eyes , tiki barber is already a journalist , michael strahan hasn t even played in a month , and plaxico burress is just being plax but all of that is from the outside because if the giants win this game against dallas , 999 percent of all this stuff goes away and gets on the charter back to dallas with the cowboys if they re tied , but the giants are 40 in the division and have swept dallas this season , with the cowboys being 14 in the division , who s got the hammer now \? i m not sure if jeanjacques taylor of the dallas morning news realizes this , but he might have written himself off tom coughlin s christmas card list headline never have the giants been so vulnerable excerpt the players might rally around each other they did have a playersonly team meeting this week and play for themselves in sunday s winnertakeall battle for the nfc east title , but they re not going to storm the field and play as hard as they can to win one for tom can you blame them \? absolutely , positively not coughlin is pottymouthed micromanager with the people skills of a 2yearold he s a former parcells assistant who seemingly took all of parcells annoying traits and none of the good ones the playersonly meeting was simply one more indication coughlin has lost the team they know he can t inspire them , so they ve turned to each other taylor ends his column dallas will end the giants misery sunday
what are your chances of staying healthy for the next 12 months \? care to place a bet \? those are the questions for many of the tens of millions of working americans now engaged in the annual healthbenefits enrollment process and who for the first time have the option of signing up for the relatively new kind of coverage known as a consumerdirected health plan but because the plans can pose risks and uncertainties , many employers are still not offering them and even where the plans are available , most experts do not expect more than a small fraction of workers to choose the coverage meant to save employers money possibly workers , too , if their gambles pay off the plans dangle the lure of lower monthly premiums than conventional coverage the tradeoff is a higher annual deductible , the money the member must pay to cover medical expenses before the insurance kicks in with the new plans , the deductible is at least 1 , 000 for an individual but can go much higher in some cases , these plans also feature a health savings account that lets the employee set taxsheltered money aside to spend on medical bills , whether in the coming year or farther out in the future some versions also help members figure out the best doctors to go to and are more generous than conventional coverage in paying for care meant to keep people healthy in some cases , consumerdirected plans are the only type of coverage offered if all this sounds more complicated and risky that conventional health insurance , it is despite heavy promotion by insurance companies , corporate benefit consultants and even cheerleading by president bush , employers have been slow to push consumerdirected health plans and workers have been even slower to choose them it s a risk thing that you take , said judy rosenthal , a working mother in independence , mo , who has experimented with four plans in five years several years ago , ms rosenthal chose a 1 , 000 deductible with a relatively low 126 monthly premium for herself and her two young sons three months later , one son broke his leg right off the top , she had to pay 1 , 000 before the health plan picked up the remainder of her son s bills i got scared and went to a 250 deductible for the next year , said ms rosenthal , who works as a research coordinator at discover vision centers , an eye care chain the premium was 326 a month that year , 2003 but it kept going up to 388 in 2004 and 440 for 2005 , when she switched plans again i could n't afford that , she said so to reduce her monthly outlay , she gambled on a plan with a 2 , 500 deductible with a 230 monthly premium last year , i came out ahead , ms rosenthal said with kids , you never know during her employer s enrollment period this year , for coverage beginning july 1 , ms rosenthal signed up for a 1 , 500 deductible plan with a 32381 premium over the fourth of july weekend , one son hurt his back playing baseball ms rosenthal quickly burned through her own 1 , 500 on a visit to an orthopedic surgeon and subsequent physical therapy because consumerdirected health plans have been around for only a short time and adopted by relatively few workers , it is hard to know yet whether they are meeting the goal of making people better consumers of health care the evidence shows that greater costsharing leads to reduction in health care use and expenditures , said melinda beeuwkes buntin , an economist who led a study of the plans that was released last month by the research center rand but what we do n't know is how this will affect overall health quality and patients' health that is why , despite the prospect of saving money on their employees' health benefits , many companies are also cautious , mindful that their workers could end up worse off large employers are not rushing pellmell into these products , said peter v lee , the chief executive of the pacific business group on health , a san franciscobased employer group during the enrollment season for 2006 , only 7 percent of employers that offer health benefits made consumerdirected plans an option , according to a widely respected annual survey conducted jointly by the kaiser family foundation and the health research and educational trust , which was released in late september the report estimated that fewer than three million workers and their dependents were enrolled in such plans many consultants and insurers say the numbers are actually much higher at least twice kaiser s estimate but that would still be only a small fraction of the 70 million or so american workers covered by employer health insurance last year , the kroger supermarket chain , one of the first large companies to offer a consumerdirected plan linked to an individual health savings account , managed to persuade only 5 percent or 3 , 500 of its 70 , 000 eligible employees to sign up to attract more employees in the current signup period , kroger is adding a 500 match to employee contributions to the health savings account

readers respond to david brooks s apr 16 column ,  ed m , seattle , wash mr brooks , you have written several columns on the incompetent handling of the iraq war by secretary rumsfeld and others but you always stop short of addressing the role of president bush he is the commander in chief he can t just be a visionary without responsibility for how policies are executed only academics and columnists have that luxury secretary rumsfeld is still in office because president bush has repeatedly asked him to stay you have been strangely reluctant to address misfeasance at the top of the chain of command the buck stops here does not refer to secretary rumsfeld paul coppock , providence ri let me see if i ve got it war is unpredictable , so it s good to have lots of options and resources the military s job is to fight wars , or at least to be prepared to fight them rumsfeld , the antiorganizationman , is a genius because he streamlines organizations tragically , streamlining the military means it is less good at fighting wars , because when streamlined its evergrowing budget provides it with fewer options and resources but rumsfeld would be a fabulous secretary of defense if only we never fought any wars is that about it \? jay davis , tulsa , okla some of the most educated people i know are also the stupidest , much like mr rumsfeld it is one thing to be oblivious to one s ineptitude , but to willingly reject out of hand any input that is contrary to your view is at times criminal in itself so it has been with rummy in the run up to operation easier said than done when general shinseki , et al , attempted to offer militarilyappropriate estimates for the numbers of personnel necessary to not only win the war , but also secure the peace , rummy and paul wolfowitz would have none of it their arrogance and ignorance have cost this country its moral high ground as well as tens of thousands of service personnel in many societies , an honorable man would resign his position when it is obvious to most that he is illequipped to carry out the task at hand unfortunately , we are governed by men without honor jacob shell , somerville , mass mr brooks i applaud your assessment of the obstinate failure of mr rumsfeld s iraq strategy yet your conclusion leaves me a bit confused you say that rumsfeld was prepared to fight organizations , not enemies but surely an enemy is an organization so just what organizations are you referring to here \? whom or what exactly was rumsfeld prepared to shake up \? the corporations \? biggovernment bureaucracies \? the republicans \? the democrats \? it sounds like , judging from the spirit of your column , you want to say that when rumsfeld engineered this war he was thinking entirely about government bureaucracies about corporations about the democrats about the republicans and not at all about the organizations that would inevitably rise up in iraq in other words and you seem to be just on the verge of saying this , but hesitant to move forward rumsfeld s war has been all along nothing more than the product of domestic power struggles

the ncaa released yesterday a second list of high schools from which it will no longer accept transcripts that provided easy academic solutions for highprofile athletes but its attempt to clean up the high school diploma mills has created more controversy none of the 25 disqualified schools , including the 16 announced yesterday , are athletic powerhouses only christopher robin academy in queens , where new york city students have long gained high school credits during the summer and winter breaks , would be deemed recognizable but the ncaa also announced a list of 22 schools that it had cleared for prospects for only the fall of 2006 these schools will be subject to review by the ncaa this list includes lutheran christian academy in philadelphia , where four former students told the new york times that they were not required to attend class and that their only teacher was their coach two days after the times s report , the ncaa announced it would propose emergency legislation to help deal with the problem but along with schools like lutheran that have been shrouded in controversy , the list includes some traditional prep powerhouses with strong academic traditions , like oak hill academy in virginia , bridgton academy in maine and fork union military academy in virginia its embarrassing to be on the list with some of those schools , steve smith , who has coached basketball at oak hill for 23 years , said last night in a telephone interview twentytwo schools in the whole country , and we 're one of them to me , it makes the ncaa look like it s not credible smith s main complaint came from the ncaa s not visiting his school the ncaa made visits to schools like lutheran christian and prince avenue prep in south carolina kevin lennon , the ncaa vice president who spearheaded this project , said irregularities in paperwork caused the ncaa to flag some schools despite not having visited them smith said he figured oak hill made the list because of its high ratio of division i athletes lennon said a time crunch prevented the ncaa from visiting every school i'm absolutely stunned on a couple of levels , michael groves , the president of oak hill , said last night in a telephone interview i 've never spoken with anyone from the ncaa i'm a bit outraged that i'm learning about a list from reporters that s damaging oak hill s reputation smith , who is at a nike camp in indianapolis , said he planned to visit the ncaa headquarters today to talk to officials smith said oak hill opened in 1878 , costs 21 , 000 a year in tuition and has about 50 staff members i'm sure if they come visit , we 'll be off the list , smith said but you ca n't take back what they already did to me , it s a total sham , a joke for many college coaches counting on freshmen enrolling for the fall semester from some of the more questionable schools on the list under review , the clearing of the players for 2006 offered a strong sense of relief brian nash , the basketball coach of st francis college in brooklyn , said he was happy for the incoming freshman david burton , who attended lutheran christian and had been in limbo for months the last thing i would have wanted to see is david not being able to go to college , nash said the last thing you want to do is call the kid up and say you ca n't come here the clearance of schools for 2006 also pleased don jackson , a lawyer based in montgomery , ala , who had predicted a flurry of lawsuits if the ncaa disqualified many schools with highprofile prospects jackson said he was pleased for the schools and students he had been in contact with , but he said he did not like that the ncaa had the option to deny athletes if there were any irregularities in their transcripts despite the fact that the schools are cleared , they 're still reserving the right to go back and investigate individual signees from those schools , jackson said 'that s counterintuitive if a school is clear , the recruit has been cleared despite controversy that will seemingly linger for another year , the ncaa said it was pleased with what it had done in attempting to stop diploma mills we know some places have shut down , and i 'd imagine we 've discouraged others from opening , lennon said we 've brought an appropriate light on this hopefully , more admissions offices are taking a harder look at kids who 've gone to

with the booming business of the port of new york and new jersey setting off more alarm than celebration , a group of government officials gathered here on tuesday to call for stricter international security standards to allay fears raised by a dubai company s move into american ports gov jon s corzine of new jersey reiterated his complaint that the bush administration did not consult with local officials before approving the 68 billion purchase of a british cargoterminal operator by dp world , which is owned by the government of dubai although mr corzine sued the federal government over the transaction last month , he said the deal had already produced benefits the whole debate has been very worthwhile because we 're standing here today talking about security boxes , mr corzine said , gesturing toward a monitoring device the port authority has begun testing on some cargo containers high above mr corzine s head , cranes operated by a danish company were plucking hundreds of steel containers filled with imports off the deck of a freighter flying a danish flag if not for the dubai controversy , almost all the talk would have been about the boom in business at the port last year , the port set annual records for the amount of cargo it handled \( 848 million metric tons \) and the value of those goods \( 1324 billion \) only about one of every dozen of the 28 million containers that passed through the port in 2005 was inspected the rest remained sealed as they entered the country from europe , asia , africa and south america and were loaded onto trucks and trains as port activity increases , so does the responsibility of port officials to ensure security , said anthony r coscia , the port authority chairman he said the authority had spent 70 million to improve security at the port since sept 11 , 2001 , and planned to spend 6 million more in the next two years the authority has joined a federal pilot program testing portable devices that could be attached to the doors of containers and track them as they travel the globe , logging their movements and checking for traces of radiation or carbon monoxide inside them the devices could be expensive , and the corporations carrying the goods would have to order the devices from factories and would have to pay for them so far , none have volunteered voluntary security is no security , said bethann rooney , the authority s director of port security the authority also filed a lawsuit related to the dp world deal the agency sued to break the lease on a container terminal at port newark , arguing that it had not been notified of the impending change in tenants as required by the lease a hearing on that complaint is scheduled for thursday morning in essex county superior court in newark mr coscia announced the creation of a panel of corporate executives and government officials to study port security and recommend changes among the panel s missions , he said , would be to focus on the disruption that would occur in the local economy if you had to shut this facility down even for a short time as evidence of how important the issue of port security has become , charles a gargano , the vice chairman of the authority , who rarely appears in new jersey , attended the media briefing mr gargano , an appointee of gov george e pataki of new york , will represent the authority on the panel
governors island , 172 acres of american history lying just off the southern tip of manhattan , is terra incognita to most new yorkers commuters , glimpsing it from the staten island ferry , see only an array of abandoned modern buildings and two unpromising landmarks a white ventilation tower belonging to the brooklynbattery tunnel , and castle williams , a grim 19thcentury fortification , dark red and pierced by black windows the island had belonged to the army since the 1800 s the coast guard took over in 1965 but left in 1997 , and it s been moldering ever since only within the past few months , after years of neglect and delay , has this stark backdrop to a crossharbor commute emerged as a major concern for the city deputy mayor daniel l doctoroff has labeled redevelopment of the island a top priority for mayor bloomberg s second term everyone recognizes that to achieve the island s potential , mr doctoroff said , we have to spend wisely now later this month the governors island preservation and education corporation , known as gipec , the state and city entity responsible for oversight of the island , will choose consultants to help it supervise planning for the island and on feb 15 , gipec will solicit formal proposals from interested developers some financing is finally on the horizon on jan 12 , gov george pataki announced that his 200607 budget request would include 30 million , and the mayor has asked for 30 million more in his current budget to pay for urgent repairs to the island s most frail structures these improvements , mayor bloomberg indicated in his jan 26 state of the city speech , will pave the way for a grand design , soon to materialize we will select a specific plan for the future of governors island , he said , that makes the most of its spectacular location , beauty and history of course , the money earmarked for the island so far constitutes only an installment on an estimated 400 million repair bill but an infusion of energy at gipec has begun to draw serious attention from the private developers on whom much of the island s future will depend both the agency and its supporters , keenly aware that projects will have to be practical , nonetheless want them to be worthy of the island s distinctive charisma it s a very special place , a place of beauty , a place of history , mr doctoroff said the island in the center of the world the experience of disembarking at the stone quayside after the sevenminute ferry ride from the battery maritime building on south street routinely elicits superlatives norman twain , a producer of spinning into butter , a forthcoming movie starring sarah jessica parker for which scenes were shot on the island , recalled one particularly evocative misty day i remember leaving our offices and walking outside in the rain , with a spectacular view of the skyline in the distance , mr twain said it was heaven that indeed describes the 92 northern acres facing manhattan but governors island is , in fact , a place of two sharply distinct landscapes , and the southern one is far from heavenly 80 acres of landfill , moved there between 1901 and 1912 from excavation for the city s first subway it s griddleflat and pocked with ramshackle 20thcentury military buildings , almost certain candidates for razing and redevelopment the socalled north island is a bucolic contrast its lawns , woods , rolling hills occupied by the lenape indians for hundreds of years before the dutch arrived in 1624 seem steeped in the past while no visible traces of early settlement survive , the north island is home to a dignified ensemble of 19thcentury brick and stone warehouse buildings that climb gently toward a green hillside just beyond them lies fort jay , surrounded by a dry moat and dating from 1794 even confederate soldiers , imprisoned there during the civil war , sometimes succumbed to its allure william drummond , who spent several months confined to the fort in 1862 , described it in his diary as a very fine place that commands a view of all the cities about new york and a full view of the harbour nearby , an enclave of old yellow clapboard and brick houses surrounds nolan park , a new englandlike village common beyond is the neogeorgian liggett hall , designed by mckim , mead white its tower , the island s tallest structure , crowns an immense archway that frames a vista toward the tip of the island until the opening of the pentagon in 1943 , liggett hall , built in 1929 to house an entire army regiment , was the largest structure ever undertaken by the american military but once the army and the coast guard left , the place fell asleep , as if under an enchantment lawns and victorian houses , the redbrick works progress administrationera movie theater with its gaping box office , the old officers' club with two deserted ballrooms overlooking the channel atop a bastion built for the war of 1812 a broad , empty promenade lined in places by a parade of london plane trees surrounds the island , opening a panorama of sea and air from the narrows to the statue of liberty and the towers of manhattan in the background perhaps no other place in the city offers a single view of so much of new york harbor , from the verrazanonarrows bridge up the hudson and east rivers as they diverge northward from the battery
i recently attended my graduation ceremony instead of walking across a stage , though , i walked halfway across a soccer field instead of a diploma , i was handed a single red rose and instead of my name being called out , it was my son s that was announced no 6 , midfielder paul lombardi he jogged over with the rose , leaned down to give me a hug and rejoined his team i went back to the bleachers with the other moms this ceremony is a school tradition during halftime of the last home game of the regular season , the seniors on the high school varsity soccer team put on this brief ritual a thankyou , an acknowledgment , for all those years , all that travel and all those hours on the sidelines we were retiring as soccer moms there is no bigger clich \? han soccer mom the term has a lot of pejorative connotations you know us we are those women who have nothing to do but drive our kids to practices and games , who live vicariously through our children s performance on the field , and who barrel down narrow roads in oversize vehicles while dispensing snacks and yammering on the cellphone naturally , i take exception to this stereotype i have never driven a minivan or an suv and hope to continue my adult life without ever doing so i have a career that interests me greatly and keeps me pretty busy there are only about six people who have my cellphone number , and it does n't even matter because i often forget to charge the phone , let alone turn it on what makes me a soccer mom is that i have a son who plays soccer and what makes me sad is that my career as a soccer mom is coming to an end sure , paul might play on a club or on an intramural team in college but i wo n't be there on the sidelines cheering and cheering is what i have been doing for more than a dozen years now for many suburban children , soccer begins in kindergarten , with those first american youth soccer organization teams the little boys and girls delicious in those jerseys that almost reach their knees play what i think of as swarm soccer that is , none of them has the remotest concept of playing a position they simply flock up and down the field along with the ball , wildly kicking whenever they get the chance , whether or not anyone on their team is there to receive it eventually , they start to get the hang of the game , though it does take awhile it was pretty common during those elementary school years for parent coaches to be yelling same team ! same team ! to a couple of teammates who were battling for possession of the ball there is also a learning curve for parents i do not want to admit how long it took me to master the concept of offsides by fourth grade , my son was playing on a travel team by the end of that first season , i was ready to put my odometer up against anyone s as a measure of parental devotion weekends were spent following vague directions to faraway fields the years went by , and as they did , there were lessons in the growth patterns of little boys turning into adolescents boys who had loomed over their teammates stopped growing in the seventh grade boys who were gangly and less coordinated came into their own and started exhibiting strong skills by middle school , pressure mounted for them to begin specializing in one sport , and soccer turned into a yearround proposition some quit we lost our best defender to the football team yes , i know i used the pronoun we my son s travel team stayed together until high school the moms and the dads did feel a part of it we spent a lot of time together we developed traditions every mother s day , we had a potluck brunch , and the moms would take on the boys in a scrimmage \( i recommend this to any parent who needs to be cured of poor sideline behavior you try playing soccer , and you will never again yell out instructions or criticisms \) with high school came more stressful tryouts and the inevitable cuts there were great coaches and difficult coaches there were overtime games played on artificial turf in driving rainstorms there were injuries there were marathon homework sessions that went well past midnight , because the players did n't get back from their weekday away games until 9 pm but boy , was there joy in watching them play for one thing , they got really good , and it was a pleasure to see them move the ball effortlessly up and down the field but i think what really made it special was that we watched this particular group of boys grow up together on the field a friend was recently putting together a photo album for the endoftheseason soccer dinner all the mothers rummaged through their old pictures there were gaptoothed first graders with one foot propped on a ball , and gawky middle schoolers with their arms around each other s shoulders the fourthgrade team picture was particularly poignant we thought they had really hit the big time on that first travel team the photo reveals them to be what they were smiling , skinny 9yearolds now they 're shaving their leg muscles are scary looking after practice , they work on their college applications they tower over the mothers who once helped them tie their cleats recently i tried to calculate how many soccer games i had attended , from paul s kindergarten days through the varsity playoffs hundreds my soccer mom rose sits in a vase on my desk i 'll probably press it in a book next year , i suspect there will be crisp fall afternoons that will feel hollow and lonely i know it s time for all of us to move on but it sure has been a wonderful run drawing \( drawing by alex nabaum \)

readers respond to thomas friedman s mar 3 column ,  jon orloff , bethesda , md your column on the trouble in iraq , credited to the blunders of the administration in not providing troops in sufficient quantity , stops a bit short we are already seeing a civil war in iraq it s being tamped down for the moment by us troops , but i predict it will grow increasingly out of control the people who are the nominal leaders there may or may not want a civil war , but they are being superseded by those who do , who have the power to make it happen expect more mosques to be blown up , and all hell to break loose after bob garza , penn valley , calif during the vietnam war , the united states had a draft despite the inequities of that system , a number of college students were at risk of being drafted this was one of the major reasons why the antiwar movement started i was a noncombat vietnam veteran and a college student who briefly participated in the movement until it lost its luster for me if you had a draft that spread the risk , then you would see a different reaction to this war people are not being asked to make any sacrifices because the bush administration understands that asking the american public to do something unpleasant may mean you have to be accountable m w mislove , madisonville , la i disagree with your basic tenet that we simply needed more troops on the ground i view iraq as similar to the former yugoslavia , only worse when tito died , yugoslavia came apart at the seams because of sectarian violence the problem with democracy is that you can t grow it at the end of a gun it only works if people believe in it , and it s not clear that the iraqis do they re allied to their religious and sectarian roots and that s what s driving the insurgency more importantly , americans don t support the iraq war on the notion of spreading democracy they support it because of bush s continuing threats that fighting terrorists in iraq is better than fighting them at home , and that iraq is the front of the war on terrorism despite the fact that there were no terrorists in iraq until we invaded you shouldn t reinvent history for bush he will do that himself and it will be hard to recall the truth once he starts like his claim two days after being warned that no one could have foreseen the levees in new orleans failing , or after years of having it pointed out , condi rice s claims that no one could have foreseen someone hijacking airplanes and using them as missiles margaret , vienna , va great analysis of what has gone wrong with the war however , the last paragraph misses the point americans , at least the ones i know , did not go to iraq to build a democracy we were told that the terrorists were there and that iraq had weapons of mass destruction i doubt that many of us would have agreed to put our sons and daughters in harm s way to bring democracy to a nation that everyone knew had no grassroots desire to be democratized , when it had terrorists to fight it has been nothing but a costly jingoist distraction from the real war on terror gale watts , new haven , vt while i agree with most of what you say in this editorial , i cannot agree with the last paragraph this war was not sold in the beginning as an effort to bring democracy to an area that certainly needs it , but as punishment for iraq s supposed links to al qaeda and other untruths americans would not have gone along with an invasion for promoting democracy bush only promotes it now that all the other excuses have been shown up for what they really were i think the real reason there is no strong antiwar movement is something you have brought up in the past there is no sense of shared sacrifice casualties and deaths are off the radar of most people , thanks to the management of most of the media it s some else s kid who s dying or being mangled , and that someone else is not usually prominent or important if the population of eighteen to thirtyfiveyearold americans were subject to a military draft , i ll bet there would be a protest movement shared sacrifice indeed elizabeth curtiss , burlington , vt it is clear that voters need to understand that the longterm policy commitment of regime change is nationbuilding as in the postworld war ii occupations of japan where my grandfather served , and in germany , this means a sustained , decentralized mixture of aid money and professional mentors to local leadership when a candidate says proudly , as bush did in 2000 , that he does not want to get into nationbuilding , we need to learn that this requires us to withhold our assent to regimechanging invasions we must learn this truth well enough , and in simple enough language , that the heat of moments like 9 11 brings it out in us rather than blurs or covers it martin karopkin , brooklyn , ny in today s column you suggest that there was no significant antiwar movement because we removed a dictator in iraq i think the reason there was no antiwar movement was because there was no draft , and there was no draft because , as you point out , sufficient troops were not used keeping the army small kept the losses and pain of war confined to that small segment of the population that volunteered for the military as you have often pointed out , the economic consequences of the war have been deferred the result is that , because the population has largely been shielded from the human and economic cost of this illconceived war , it has gone forward with no meaningful opposition who says this administration isn t smart \? the trouble is they know how to get power but don t have a clue as to how to use it the trouble with the rest of us is that we don t get motivated until the pain hits home fionna bright , aurora , colo there has not been a broad antiwar movement in this country because there has been no draft as for broad american support for creating democracies around the world , i believe that most americans while they do support democracy over dictatorship do not support thrusting democracy on people , especially violently i believe that if most americans knew the history of ciabacked coups and of our interventions in other countries , they would be appalled i believe that most americans rely on their televisions and local papers to tell them what is going on , and that not very many read or investigate in more depth believing that , i would assert that most americans now oppose our presence in iraq and want us to leave this year , and that that opposition is based on news and opinion available in small ways that makes it a very strong opposition i appreciate that you want to give people some credit for being deeply patriotic , but i m just not sure that s how americans support what they support it might be interesting to find out john miller , monterey , calif thank you for an informative and interesting analysis of the current situation that we face as things continue to unravel in iraq are the president and his advisors so insulated from reality that they actually believe the us can win in iraq with current troop strengths \? or are they hoping to hang on until 2008 and then say to their successors , to paraphrase louis xv , after us , the deluge \? i fear the latter scenario is closer to the truth the problem is that mr bush is not an fdr nor is he a churchill the president should long ago have exhorted each of us to face the blood , toil , tears and sweat that a victory in iraq requires a leader who asks for no sacrifice from his people will get none our generals are short of troops , yet few households have yet felt the sacrifice that this war is daily demanding from those few who are fighting in iraq our soldiers die and few pay attention for most of us , our greatest complaint these days is that the cost of gasoline is far too high it is time for america to face reality clearly , recruiting volunteer soldiers will not do the job the president must reinstate the draft and conscript both men and women he must put all healthy drafteligible americans across the sociopolitical landscape at equal risk to raise our troop strengths to acceptable levels true , a new draft law would no doubt quickly transform american college campuses into demonstration mosh pits so be it let the draft be a referendum on the war if bush can convince america s draftage youth that the war is worth fighting , he will get the soldiers he needs to win in iraq if he cannot , let him end it and admit he made a grave and costly error
correction appended welcome back to mad scientist week today , i want to look at a question i raised in my first column why is it that birds don t get pregnant \? or to put it another way , why do all birds lay eggs \? questions like this matter because the answer tells us something important about the paths evolution can take some people suppose that from time to time , evolution gets stuck that certain evolutionary directions are impossible \( or at least , very difficult \) according to this school of thought , birds can t evolve pregnancy some aspect of their biology stops them others argue that when such a phenomenon fails to evolve , the reason is not that it can t , but that it s not beneficial this view says birds don t evolve pregnancy because there s presently no advantage in it at the moment , we can t easily tell which view is correct no one has done any experiments today , i m going to propose one first , i should say what i mean by pregnancy i mean giving birth to live young the alternative is laying eggs however , different animals have different kinds of pregnancies humans , mice , dogs and other mammals of our sort make tiny eggs the young draw nourishment from their mothers as they grow in contrast , boa constrictors give birth to live young but rather than nourishing the developing embryos as she goes along , a female boa constrictor makes large eggs which she keeps inside her body until the young have finished developing here , the embryos are nourished by yolk , as they are in a bird s egg , but they develop inside their mother until they are ready to slither off into the world marsupial mammals kangaroos , koalas , opossums and that crowd do a mix of the two marsupial eggs are \( relatively \) large and yolky , but the mother also transfers nutrients to the embryo in short , there s a spectrum of ways to be pregnant and a lot of organisms have taken up the practice if you stroll down nature s maternity ward , you ll find quite the menagerie you ll find fish such as coelacanths , guppies , sea horses \( here it s the male who carries the young \) , blue sharks and smooth dogfish you ll see pregnant amphibians and a multitude of snakes and lizards mammals will be there , too \( not all of them , though three species still lay eggs the most famous of these is that fabulously strange animal , the duckbilled platypus \) birds , however , are missing of the five major groups of animals with backbones , only birds have never evolved pregnancy why not \? when i raised this question in my first column , a number of readers answered it by observing that birds fly but \( as i mentioned in my response \) the answer is not so simple bats fly yet they have pregnancy moreover , many birds do not fly big birds like ostriches and emus are grounded penguins have swapped the sky for the sea and birds living on remote islands mauritius , the islands of new zealand , hawaii , the galapagos and other distant archipelagos often abandon flight new zealand is home to flightless parrots and flightless ducks \( among others \) yet none of these has switched from eggs antarctic penguins , it seems to me , would do especially well with live birth they wouldn t have this silly business of trying to keep their eggs warm when the temperature is 50 below and they ve had plenty of time the ancestors of modern penguins abandoned flight at least 100 million years ago so , is it because they can t \? or is it that they could but they don t \? both schools of thought can make good arguments the don t school can point to all the times pregnancy has evolved fish , for instance , are thought to have evolved it about 20 times that is , if you look at the fish family tree , species with pregnancy are scattered across it , and different lineages have arrived at it independently lizards and snakes are even more pregnancyprone they are estimated to have invented it as many as 100 times in other words , evolving pregnancy doesn t look that hard to do the can t school , meanwhile , invokes turtles and crocodiles \( related to birds , they also just lay eggs \) , or complicated arguments about eggshells , or the fact that although most birds have warmer body temperatures than we do around 40 degrees celsius their embryos must develop at a lower temperature \( this isn t just because birds have to leave their eggs sometimes birds that live in hot places actually spend time cooling their eggs down , or the embryos die indeed , the embryos are more sensitive to excessive heat than to excessive cold \) pregnancy would according to this view expose the embryos to lethal temperatures but although both sides can point to this and that , neither has proof their argument is right to tell which side is right , we need to do an experiment the ideal strategy would be to try to evolve a pregnant bird but this might take a rather long time a more practical aim would be to try to discover whether the imagined constraints are real here s one way we could do that when lizards switch from eggs to pregnancy , they don t do it overnight they start gradually , by keeping the eggs inside their bodies for a bit longer and laying the eggs when the embryos are more advanced in short , the first step in evolving pregnancy is becoming eggretentive interestingly , egg retention is virtually unknown in birds in almost all species , the female lays the egg as soon as it s been fertilized so i suggest that we take a bird , such as a cuckoo , which does sometimes keep its eggs inside for longer than is usual , and see whether we can stretch out its eggretention time to do this , we d breed cuckoos as horse breeders breed racehorses except that instead of choosing the fastest animals to breed , we d choose the most retentive ones cuckoos that keep their eggs for longest before laying would be rewarded by having their chicks go into the next round if it turns out to be very difficult to shift the retention time , we d know there is little genetic variation for the trait and the constraint is real then we could start to explore the reasons why \( we could do the same type of experiment to try and raise the temperature at which the embryos can develop \) if shifting egg retention turns out to be easy say , after 50 generations we ve got healthy cuckoos that can hold an egg for two weeks then we know that holding an egg doesn t evolve because it s not useful to the animal such an experiment would be massive you d need lots of birds and lots of years it probably won t get done but just in case , here s my prediction we would be able to evolve eggretentive birds editor s note an earlier version of this post incorrectly described the type of snake that gives birth to live young is is the boa constrictor , not the python

no , this has nothing to do with peyton , archie , eli , or even cooper , the daniel baldwin of the manning family by manning up , i mean the following fantasy football experts are rarely , if ever , held accountable for their predictions from week to week they give you some fleeting startbench info on thursday or friday and then poof ! it s typically forgotten by the time the monday night football broadcast has ended , mercifully releasing the american public from the death grip of joe theismann s weekly idiocy \( how he manages to remain employed by espn or any tv network is one of life s most puzzling questions , right up there with where is jimmy hoffa buried \? and how is twoandahalf men a toprated show \? \) i don t even think there is such a thing as a fantasy football expert sure , i may have written a book on the subject , and that gives me a certain air of double secret expertness that some might not possess and i do think i know a little more about strategy and whatnot than the average mook out there that said , it s not like i graduated from the fantasy football equivalent of harvard law or johns hopkins medical \( can you imagine the classes if there were such bastions of higher ff learning \? handcuffing your injury prone studs 101 with professor fred taylor , or the psychological impact of touchdown vultures with dr leroy hoard \) rather , i m just a guy who quit his real job and created the extra time to do nothing but focus on my fantasy football team and obsess over such historically important figures as nick goings and boo williams i am no expert which is why i m about to do what no expert ever really does hold myself accountable and man up , in none other than the new york times , for the picks i blew last week and classify them as losses while , of course , dislocating my shoulder patting myself on the back for the picks i got right and calling them wins \( or at least ties \) these were the week 1 gems i listed and their results corey dillon 73 yards , 0 td not a great day , but ok yardagewise in my defense , all week the real football experts said maroney wouldn t be active hence , my call that dillon at home against the bills was a nobrainer but maroney played , played well , and even had one more carry than the starter dillon welcome to belichickville , population several hundred thousand incensed dillon owners loss deuce mcallister 90 yds rushing the good news \? deuce looked slimmer and had the lion s share of the carries , especially on the goal line the bad news \? the saints lost their two top fullbacks in the first half and couldn t punch in any of his end zone chances a line of 90 yards and two tds would have made this a win as it is , i m giving myself a tie because his yardage was nice and he looked fresh chris brown 64 yds on 16 carries , with travis henry getting the two short tds i expected more out of an allegedly healthy brown , but he tanked , perhaps due to the turf toe injury that s popped up again loss brian westbrook 132 total yds and a td \( a long td , too , if your league awards bonuses for those \) i d call that a big win thomas jones 21 carries for 63 yds , 0 td more good newsbad news good jones was clearly the 1 guy , with benson receiving half the carries \( 11 \) once the game was in hand bad jones didn t do much with those extra carries , and didn t find the end zone , although he did scamper up the gut on a 17yarder only to get tripped up on the 3 as with deuce , a td would have made this a win based on decent yardage and being the clear 1 rb \( a rarity these days \) as it stands , it s a loss roy williams 3 catches for 36 yds loss that said , this entire game was an offensive black hole all cardinals warner , edge , fitz and \( to a lesser extent , though he had a receiving td that fitz didn t \) boldin all had very nice games even terry metcalf caught 7 passes for 88 yards and a score win aaron brooks loss isn t strong enough for how bad brooks made me look so i ll label this one spayed aaron brooks took about 28 sacks before being removed for andrew walter steve mcnair 181 yds , td he looked very confident , steady , but was nothing spectacular fantasywise a rushing td would have helped but the fact that he had a td pass and didn t leave the field on a stretcher makes this a tie frank gore nearly 170 total yards and two tds i d call that a big win marc bulger jake plummer like brooks , these two liars told me we were going for a fun car ride and then going to play in the park a car ride ! the park ! yay ! but when i excitedly hopped into the back of the station wagon and we started on our way , it soon dawned on me , heyyyyy , this isn t the way to the park ! next thing you know , i m lying groggy on the vet s table and snip , snip i m neutered 3 picks for plummer 200something yards and no tds for bulger spayed ben watson 3 catches for 50 yds not many te s these days get 50 yards receiving , but a td \( preferably a long one like rookie vernon davis s \) would have made his owners much happier tie my super gem was some person named chris henry , who may or may not play professional football for a living even with houshmandzadeh out , the talented but troubled henry did nothing , thanks in part to a rainstorm and carson palmer seemingly throwing 10 passes all day 1 catch , 5 yds let us never speak of him again and here were my week 1 gimps clinton portis as with maroney , portis made a miraculous recovery by game time and got some carries 10 for 39 yds and a td but i ll call this one a tie because those are not numbers you want form a firstrounder , and hopefully you sat him in favor of a gore or a warrick dunn , who outperformed him jamal lewis 78 yards and a td loss would have looked even worse if the game was closer billick took lewis out when the game was well in hand would have probably topped 100 yards lendale white inactive and best avoided , as predicted but at least he didn t spit on anyone win steve smith ditto , minus the spitting hope you didn t take a chance on starting him just because you drafted him high and like seeing his name in your lineup win peerless price 3 catches 25 yds , 0 td now , i realize this one wasn t a stretch , but he was getting some lateweek hype as a sleeper now that he s back in buffalo problem is , as inconsistent a fantasy qb as the guy he left \( vick \) was , the guy for whom he s now running useless routes \( losman \) is even worse win david carr 208 yds , td see mcnair carr played pretty well , didn t make many mistakes , but was sacked a few times and by a few i mean five , which he should be used to by now tie darrell jackson 5 catches , 47 yds close to being a loss because he probably gained 9 points in standard scoring leagues with pointsperreception , but since those catches and yards were all utterly useless in this defensive snoozefest and since i m the judge i m giving myself a tie because all signs pointed to him playing a lot less than he did jon kitna 229 yds , 0 td as homer simpson would say , boring ! win brett favre 170 yds , 0td , 2 int sadly , this is an upgrade from the majority of brett favuhrah s games in 2005 win byron leftwich 237 yds , 1 td , 1int not that this is a great stat line , but you could have done worse than leftwich this weekend \( cough , brooks , plummer , cough ! \) loss keenan mccardell 1 catch 18 yds nailed this one until rivers gets his feet under him , stay away it didn t help that schottenhemier ran on obvious throwing downs guess he s afraid of rivers , too win and for my super gimps , i split despite his work in the passing game \( 5 catches for 45 yards \) , kevin jones was a win based on his anemic rushing line \( 14 carries for 35 yds \) julius , however , proved me wrong by rushing for 72 yards and a td loss so , what s the tally \? 10 wins , 10 losses and 6 ties not exactly the kind of football foresight that ll land me the starring role in two for the money ii an even worse movie about football gambling with generic football teams playing in generic championship games not named super bowl because nfl suits are neonazis with their licensing rights but at least i started at 500 , and hopefully the wins i provided helped you eek out some victories of your own now that i m done publicly flogging myself which is a crime in georgia , last i checked here are some gems and gimps for week 2 gems rarely will i make a waytooobvious blanket announcement like this , but i feel i have to lots of ff players out there were spooked in week 1 by bad games from their early picks and may be contemplating doing something very silly , like benching a stud so , as a public service , to start this off , i m going to simply say start all your bengal , colt and seahawk studs that means guys like reggie wayne , chad , carson , alexander , and hasselbeck should all be active , no matter how little they produced last week they re playing the browns , texans and cardinals , respectively nuff said ronnie brown the steelers buffalo ain t look for brown to have just as many tds , but to land in the 150 total yards range chris chambers buffalo s troy vincent is out for the season , weakening an already weak pass defense look for chambers to snag at least 90 yards and one touchdown from daunte culpepper he s not the vikings daunte anymore by a long shot , but he bounces back this weekend to the tune of 260 yards and a couple of tds on the downside , fans will have to witness him doing that bizarre handrolldancething baltimore defense anyone playing the alreadyreeling raiders makes a great start lots of picks lots of sacks lots of blood marc bulger going to the rams well again despite being burned last week but don t underestimate how the niners can cure a quarterback s ills bulger gets 300 yards and 2 scores vernon davis on the flip side of the rams game is davis , who will be a major factor in the niners playing catchup all day long he ll have some drops he s a rookie but his bigplay ability can t be denied 57 catches , 6080 yards and a td corey dillon again i stick my hand back in the fire , but so be it dillon , even if maroney splits carries , will find the end zone at least once against the woeful jets chester taylor minny s oline looked world class on monday night and the fact that he ll keep getting 25 carries bodes well chester drops 140 total yards and a td this week andre johnson with an uncertain , threeheaded running game , houston will be throwing all day against the colts johnson , a big guy who goes up against smallish colts corners , is the beneficiary plaxico burress you know , i almost named my new daughter plaxico that , or craphonso anyway , even against the tough eagles , plax will use that big frame of his to outmuscle guys and be eli s primary target tatum bell the other bell is banged up \( finger \) denver plays the chiefs start tatum confidently as a flex player or rb2 terry glenn the undermanned skins secondary will have its hands full with to , freeing up glenn for a big game great flex player this week tony gonzalez again , not hard to recommend starting gonzo but some owners may be freaking over the ghoulish specter of damon huard under center for the chiefs but don t fret huard targeted gonzo over and over last week , and will do so again this week super gems plural of the week rod smith whatever good plays plummer has in him this week will be linked to rod smith he tends to play well against division rivals at home , and the broncos as a whole should bounce back start smith confidently as a flex willis mcgahee who cares if it s the dolphins \? mcgahee looked faster , slimmer , shiftier against the pats , and even though buffalo will likely lose on the road , wilis will get his gimps gimp is relative , but my first one to see a downturn in his production is willie parker big ben will be back , and the jags are tough against the run parker doesn t have nearly the yardage he had last week that , and najeh davenport might arrive to be the new bettis on the goal line \( although i ll have to see it before i believe it \) steve smith no change from last week avoid him if you have other options he ll be a gametime decision at best thomas jones in a change from last week , i m not high on jones detroit looked solid shutting down alexander , and jones , sir , you are no shaun alexander that , and benson is healing and will get more carries unless he can find the end zone , jones will have a rough day \( and , yes , i m using reverse psychology because i own him in my main league \) kevin jones i will announce the following reasons why jones should be avoided , and do so in alphabetical order bears defense that is all lamont jordan a high pick \? yes a high week 2 risk \? oh yes chances are , you ll have to start him , but don t expect much with that shoddy line and passing game against a defense that held carnell williams to 22 yards and , yes , i refuse to call him cadillac because that inevitably leads to maddening caddy is dented caddy is in the shop caddy has a flat sportswriter cliches randy moss like jordan , you have to start him but it seems as if he s already quit on this season and this team owner beware don t trade him or jordan because you ll never get proper value for them and they have to have some nice games at some point , but that won t be this week alex smith might be tempting to take a flier on the niners qb if you re a delhomme plummer green brooks favre owner and are looking for an alternative but despite the solid numbers he posted against the cards , this is not the week to start him most weeks aren t weeks to start him so there keenan mccardell going to the well here again until schottenheimer lets rivers throw , and rivers can prove he can throw , avoid mccardell mark brunell the dallas d will be salivating to get its hands on this aging , immobile cantaloupe of a qb and he hasn t yet grasped the new al saunders offense bad combo super gimps plural of the week eddie kennison damon huard in mile high bad very , very bad reuben droughns cleveland s running game looked pitiful against the saints , who won t be confused with the 75 steel curtain anytime soon it gets harder in cincy against the bengals be afraid that s it for week 2 i ll be back next week to take my lumps and pat myself on the back accordingly good luck \( mark st amant is also the author of \)
it began with a 15run outburst in oakland on april 3 , when the yankees seemed invincible the whole season was before them , and the yankees believed they could realize the goal on the tshirts they made for themselves that week the shirts said mission 27 , referring to the yankees' quest for a 27th world series title and their first since 2000 players wore them all year long we 've talked about it there are lots of clocks that are on , alex rodriguez said the day before the opener contract clocks , age clocks i think the urgency is at an alltime high this year , and that s good it s exciting those clocks are ticking now , louder and louder , after another swift playoff exit for many prominent yankees , time may be up the yankees could spend 30 million to pick up the options on mike mussina \( 17 million \) and gary sheffield \( 13 million \) more likely , they will let those players become free agents bernie williams also faces free agency , and he said saturday he had not decided if he wanted to retire but the most intriguing question will be the futures of manager joe torre and rodriguez torre has just one year left on his contract , and the magic he once wielded in the postseason has disappeared there are club executives who wonder if he should be back , and others in the organization who have noticed that torre has not won a pennant since the resignation of the bench coach don zimmer in october 2003 the yankees have lost their last three playoff series , and are 310 in the postseason since taking a threegamestonone lead over boston in the 2004 american league championship series torre survived that collapse , but he had almost no communication last season with the principal owner , george steinbrenner they reconciled last october and torre returned , speaking more often with steinbrenner , who kept his pledge to recede further into the background torre managed the yankees without public secondguessing by steinbrenner general manager brian cashman made moves without interference from steinbrenner s advisers in tampa , fla the partnership succeeded for a while , torre guiding the team to its ninth consecutive division title and cashman making important personnel moves but the playoff upset could disrupt everything , depending on steinbrenner s reaction at 76 , steinbrenner is more of a shadowy presence than a looming threat his soninlaw , the general partner steve swindal , is considered more rational than steinbrenner , a calming presence who has a strong relationship with torre yet it is steinbrenner who has spent more than 975 million in salaries over the last six seasons without winning a title he retains his prerogative to change his mind on the manager in that context , torre has to be considered somewhat vulnerable asked after game 4 if torre would be back , cashman said yes obviously , i have people above me , he said but the question came to me , and i'm answering it as i see it steinbrenner was in new york on saturday awaiting a possible fifth game his spokesman , howard rubenstein , said he could not reach steinbrenner for a comment on the series rodriguez has a complete notrade clause , and he reiterated after game 4 that he wanted to return as long as the yankees want him back there are four years remaining on his contract , and the yankees owe him 64 million at that price , rodriguez would be affordable to several bigmarket teams , including either team in chicago or los angeles but cashman said on saturday i'm not looking to trade alex i'm not as usual , there will be prominent starters available as free agents , including jason schmidt , barry zito and andy pettitte , the former yankee the yankees might have more interest in the japanese righthander daisuke matsuzaka , if his team allows him to become a free agent there is little flexibility in the lineup , which has no potential free agents besides sheffield if sheffield leaves , the yankees could commit to using melky cabrera as an everyday outfielder , which would allow them to rotate johnny damon , hideki matsui and bobby abreu at designated hitter the yankees also face several injury issues first baseman jason giambi said saturday that he would have surgery on his left wrist but expected to be ready for spring training randy johnson has not dismissed the possibility of back surgery , and carl pavano has said he plans to recover from his long list of ailments at a training facility in arizona it is hard to imagine the yankees relying on pavano to stay healthy , and they must make a decision on another starter , jaret wright the yankees could keep wright and pay him 7 million next season , or buy out his contract for 4 million and let him become a free agent cashman was in no mood to address those issues saturday to cashman , it seemed too early to talk about the next mission 27 i have n't looked at anything , he said in the hallway outside a quiet clubhouse i was n't prepared to be looking at this stuff , early as we are photo manager joe torre , center , and the coaches lee mazzilli , left , and ron guidry enduring yesterday s seriesending loss to detroit in game 4 \( photo by

as clusters of openhouse balloons bob across the suburbs of the metropolitan area , from the new englandy enclaves of fairfield county , conn , to the saltsprayed boroughs of the jersey shore , the question remains whither the housing market \? everyone , it seems , has an answer , and those answers can be strangely contradictory and accurate at the same time if inventory is your gauge , the market is slackening if prices are your prism , it s still going strong but in interviews with more than two dozen real estate agents , buyers , sellers and economists , the consensus is that the housing market in the region remains remarkably buoyant but is coming down to earth prices are still in the clouds , but inventory is expanding and bidding wars , once commonplace , are increasingly rare if the boom is over , there is no bust in sight it s turning , said pearl m kamer , chief economist for the long island association , the island s largest business organization it s neither a buyer s nor a seller s market buyers say they no longer feel pressured to make an offer the moment they step over the doorsill \( there are even isolated reports of some sellers getting lowball offers \) brokers , meanwhile , are lecturing sellers to be more realistic about prices , and sellers are working harder to spruce up their homes a few years ago , sellers were not making their beds and leaving dishes in the sink , and buyers were still coming and buying , said cindy derose , a sales agent for hudson shores realtors in irvington , ny it is still a healthy market but it has cooled down enough that sellers just have to do a little more work , frankly of course , the real estate market in the new york city suburbs has long had its ups and downs but over time , houses there have proved to be extraordinary investments because people want to be close to the city while enjoying the relative safety and good public schools the suburbs tend to offer though the pattern of contradiction in the current market seems fairly consistent from state to state , there are differences from one community to the next , with some towns appearing almost impervious to any downturn , at least for now frank anthony , a sales associate for coldwell banker in mendham , nj , called the current market town sensitive he compared a cape cod in east hanover , nj , that was first listed for 539 , 000 and sat on the market for 80 days with a colonial in millburn , nj , that was listed for 775 , 000 and sold in two days mr anthony says he believes the market is still hot as long as three conditions are met nice house , nice location and nice price for all the talk of a bubble , prices do not seem ready to collapse or even edge south , with the exception of houses whose price tags were plainly inflated brokers say the 1 million mark seems to be a dividing line houses priced for less sell quickly , while houses listed for more are sitting longer and , in some cases , going for less than their list prices the most recent statewide real estate data for new york , new jersey and connecticut show that housing prices continued to appreciate late last year , but at a less breathless clip than the year before according to rae d rosen , a senior economist and assistant vice president for the federal reserve bank of new york , the growth rate in the price of an average house peaked at the same moment in all three states , the third quarter of 2004 new york state saw a 17 percent increase in sales prices for singlefamily houses , over the same quarter in 2003 connecticut , 15 percent and new jersey , 185 percent by comparison , in the last quarter of 2005 , housing prices in new york rose 126 percent over the year before , 119 percent in connecticut and 146 percent in new jersey westchester county s fourth quarter witnessed a more modest increase of 6 percent and some brokers say that housing prices may be leveling off it s like going from 60 miles per hour to 30 miles per hour , ms rosen said of the rise in prices we 're just decelerating it looks like the market is moving away from its peak armed with reports of an easing market and steeped in internet research , some buyers are heading to open houses with raised hopes , expecting to find a house or a condominium they can not only afford but also actually want to inhabit some are equating a softening market with falling prices they are often disappointed there does n't seem to be any rhyme or reason to this market , said claudia denatale , who recently toured a lackluster threebedroom condominium in huntington station listed for 425 , 000 there s been so much talk about the market changing , but i do n't see anything dramatic when you talk about a drop , it should be significant what many buyers do report is greater choice indeed , inventory tight as a noose since 2000 is up across the region , sometimes markedly on long island , the number of unsold houses in january stood at 23 , 470 , a 67 percent jump from the year before inventory in connecticut also rose in fairfield county , the number of houses for sale at the end of last year was 35 percent higher than in late 2004 inventories in some communities \( norwalk , easton , new canaan and darien \) were up more than 50 percent
east pencil in the patriots , but the dolphins could erase them a personal rule is not to pick against the new england patriots until coach bill belichick and quarterback tom brady are firmly in retirement you never look stupid picking new england , winner of three of the past five super bowls but this could be the season the patriots' storied nostars system gets pushed harder than it has in a long time new england lost linebacker willie mcginest , receiver david givens and , in one of the headscratching decisions of the offseason , placekicker adam vinatieri players come and go , according to the patriots' formula , but those three were stalwarts of the championship years and when linebacker tedy bruschi broke his wrist in the preseason , another bedrock was lost for all of training camp if he is available , he will wear a cast a contract holdout by receiver deion branch means brady s favorite target is off schedule , too what does it all mean for the patriots \? certainly not catastrophe , but maybe not as easy a ride as they have had in recent years brady and belichick make the patriots contenders no matter what else happens around them just check last season s results , when a revolving door in the secondary did not keep the patriots from winning a game in the playoffs , thanks to an mvpcaliber year by brady but the slow trickling away of talent , combined with the improvement of the miami dolphins , could mean the patriots may not dominate those , of course , are the challenges belichick thrives on a relatively easy schedule means the patriots should at least equal last season s 115 record pencil them in for the division title , and for a run deep into the playoffs , until further notice the american football conference east used to be the premier division in football , but that was when the dolphins were a perennial playoff team they may be close to that again coach nick saban , a belichick friend and disciple , has been credited with turning around the laidback culture of the dolphins and while he may be making no friends , he is whipping miami into a playoff team in record time the dolphins made what might have been the most significant offseason acquisition this side of terrell owens when they plucked quarterback daunte culpepper from the vikings combine that with the sixgame winning streak to finish 97 last season with gus frerotte at quarterback and there is reason for hope in south florida if culpepper s knee is healthy \( he has looked surprisingly mobile \) and if ronnie brown takes the next step to being a premier running back \( he will have to because ricky williams is suspended \) , the offense could be more interesting than it has been since dan marino retired a favorable schedule no west coast games , and only one game in potentially bad weather should put the dolphins into position for a wild card and , if the patriots slip , a shot at the division title the rest of the division , though , is a mess the jets and the buffalo bills are rebuilding , with new coaches and questions at quarterback the jets want to be like new england , and they hired belichick s former defensive coordinator , eric mangini , to do it too bad brady stayed behind in foxborough quarterback chad pennington and running back curtis martin are the biggest questions on a team that has to restock its talent pool the bills brought back the old marv levy , 81 , is the general manager and went with youth , getting rid of several bigname veterans the future will be brighter for both teams , but rebuilding is a slow process , especially when the patriots and the dolphins are on the schedule twice a year west with new coach and better defense , chiefs may challenge for years , the kansas city chiefs' owner , lamar hunt , has been trying to get the nfl to expand the playoff pool it is not hard to understand why for the past five seasons , the chiefs have had one of the league s most thrilling offenses but they have had only one playoff appearance and one loss to show for it the playoff pool has not grown , but the chiefs made a change that could help their playoff chances herman edwards was hired as coach after dick vermeil retired edwards will demand a better defense and will import his more conservative offensive philosophy that means more touches for running back larry johnson , though the unexpected retirement of left tackle willie roaf will downgrade what was one of the best offensive lines in the nfl with the departure of the offensive coordinator al saunders to the washington redskins , the chiefs' attack may be more balanced than in recent years , and that dovetails nicely with edwards s philosophy of winning with defense and an errorfree offense the problem is that the chiefs' offensive roster is still geared to a highpowered attack no matter the talent is there to challenge the denver broncos for the division title , and the chiefs should certainly be good enough to grab a wildcard spot the broncos may not win 13 games again this season , but they should be a better team than the one that lost in the afc championship game to the pittsburgh steelers quarterback jake plummer imploded in that game , but he showed last season that he was capable of playing under control and with few errors the offense , which has always relied on a pounding running game , should be more explosive because of the acquisition of receiver javon walker the broncos could go with the undrafted running back mike bell as the starter , but almost anyone who runs behind denver s zone blocking should gain 1 , 000 yards
journalists , moral and ethical eunuchs that we are , tend to root for whatever story creates a nice running narrative to keep our beat juicy so , while the bagger was pleased that dreamgirls , which he saw last night , lived up to the awards hype , he was freaked that so many of the important oscar categories seemed to have been settled by the time the credits rolled three months before the ceremony all sorts of things can happen between now and february 25 and it s always worth mentioning that nobody knows anything still , dreamgirls is the last big hardware magnet out of the gate and admitting it is a prohibitive favorite in any number of categories takes a little of the fun out of carpetbagging last year , brokeback was the clear leader , but it was very much part of a horse race , and of course there was a surprise in the envelope jack nicholson opened , which only a few saw coming the bagger , of course , looks only at a film s apparent awards value , not its artistic merit , which he leaves to the pros think of the bagger as a monkey out a limb with a very sophisticated tenkey calculator but he is willing to bet , based on his vast history of oscar coverage okay , it was one season , but still that dreamgirls will become the film that ate the 79th annual academy awards best picture \? settled directing \? done art direction \? natch costume design \? can t touch this sound \? please adapted screenplay \? send the hardware art direction \? a lock a bunch of other categories could fall as well , including musical score , sound and film editing here is the theory of the case this is a year of excellent films , good for the industry business has been better than people think and for the schlubs in the seats but like last year , not a lot of big movies have landed instead , there are a bunch of highquality smaller ones the departed , the one big moviemovie , is a peach , but the abrupt ending will have some of the older members of the academy they are in the majority , btw leaving the theater feeling that they had been covered in blood and among the other promising films like babel , little children and little miss sunshine \( the littles as the bagger likes to call them \) , along with the queen and volver none seem big enough to halt the dreamgirls juggernaut that will develop in the coming weeks and the bagger doesn t buy the conventional wisdom that flags of our fathers will be in the mix when all is said and done dreamgirls will triumph because is a luscious parfait , with many layers of appeal it is gorgeous , the costumes alone tell a story , and it has multiple musical showstoppers , each of which really stop the show director bill condon has managed to conjure a film version of a musical that is both reinvention and homage , giving both academy hipsters and those with hip replacements a way in there is a narrative of personal empowerment a girl s gotta know who she is and in the backstory , jennifer hudson , a former american idol candidate , ambles in amidst jamie foxx , beyonc knowles and danny glover , and steals the show still , the acting awards are far tougher to call in musicals dramatic roles tend to become just connective tissue between songs there were plenty of amazing female parts this year , including ones played by helen mirren , kate winslet , penelope cruz and meryl streep but you will hear ms hudson s name and , on the male side , eddie murphy s both will probably be positioned in the supporting category as clear favorites , and be found in the same sentence so many times over the next few months that you will think they are a couple when chicago another musical where an old story was given a shiny , irresistible new dress took home six awards in 2002 , director rob marshall was not honored but this year , the bagger is guessing , mr condon will probably get much love shown he is a pressandindustry favorite , a remarkably nice , remarkably talented director with range he directed kinsey and gods and monsters and wrote the screenplay for chicago who will probably be part of denying martin scorsese one more time keep in mind that the bagger saw the film with an industry press crowd in manhattan , that island off the coast of america as spalding gray called it , so the fact that the audience was cheering and hugging itself midsolo does not guarantee similar results with real folks who live in something besides a hothouse but the bagger is betting that around christmas day , when the film actually opens , families will line up to see this movie and they will tell their friends to go , so dreamgirls will have the box office to back up the awards chatter of course , all is subject to revision and derision as the awards season unfurls there s a lot of spinning and grinning that will be offered for your consideration , but until something or someone comes along to knock it off its pedestal , the dreamgirls reign surpreme

three years into the conflict in iraq , the front line in the american drive to prepare troops for insurgent warfare runs through a cluster of mock iraqi villages deep in the mojave desert , nearly 10 , 000 miles from the realities awaiting the soldiers outside baghdad and mosul and falluja out here , 150 miles northeast of los angeles , units of the 10th mountain division from fort drum , ny , are among the latest warbound troops who have gone through three weeks of training that introduce them to the harsh episodes that characterize the american experience in iraq in a 1 , 000squaremile region on the edge of death valley , arabamericans , many of them from the iraqi expatriate community in san diego , populate a group of mock villages resembling their counterparts in iraq american soldiers at forward operating bases nearby face insurgent uprisings , suicide bombings and even staged beheadings in underground tunnels recently , the soldiers here , like their counterparts in iraq , have been confronted with sunnishiite riots at one village , a secret guerrilla revolt is in the works with actors and stuntmen on loan from hollywood , american generals have recast the training ground at fort irwin so effectively as a simulation of conditions in iraq and afghanistan over the past 20 months that some soldiers have left with battle fatigue and others have had their orders for deployment to the war zones canceled in at least one case , a soldier s career was ended for unnecessarily killing civilians we would rather you got killed here than in iraq , said maj john clearwater , a veteran of the special forces who works at the training center the troops who come here are at the heart of a vast shift in american warfighting strategy , a multibilliondollar effort to remodel the army on the fly here , the army is relearning how to fight , shifting from its historic emphasis on big armytoarmy battles to the more subtle tactics of defeating a guerrilla insurgency the changes in the army s emphasis are among the most farreaching since world war ii , all being carried out at top speed , while the iraqi insurgency continues undiminished and political support for the war ebbs at home american commanders say publicly that they still believe they can win the war , especially now with a more coherent strategy to combat the insurgency and train their soldiers to fight it the lack of such planning indeed , the refusal in the first months after the invasion to acknowledge the presence of the insurgency is at the heart of the criticism leveled recently at secretary of defense donald h rumsfeld by six former generals beneath the public veneer , some american officers say they believe that public support for the war will probably run out before the changes will begin to make a major difference the more probable chain of events , they say , is a steady drawdown of american forces from iraq , long before the insurgency is defeated education in counterinsurgency for the first time in more than 20 years , military planners are revising the army s counterinsurgency manual , adding emphasis on nationbuilding and peacekeeping subjects once belittled by the bush administration at the army s command and general staff college in fort leavenworth , kan , officers are being required for the first time to complete a course in counterinsurgency in iraq , american officers entering the country are now required to spend their first week at the sprawling military base at taji , on the northwestern edge of baghdad , attending a crash course in counterinsurgency junior officers are being encouraged to take greater initiative to adjust to local circumstances an old military tradition of chronicling the lessons learned on the front and passing them on to other units has found a vital new outlet in passwordprotected internet sites where platoon commanders and more senior officers can exchange combat experiences the aim is to see that any new techniques adopted by the insurgents , especially in mounting the roadside bombing attacks that accounted for more than half of all american casualties in iraq , are made known to all units as quickly as possible , often within 24 hours one third of the american troops now stationed in iraq have been through the course here , and entire brigades each with 4 , 000 soldiers , sometimes more are processed through here every month but it is still unclear how much effect the new training is having in the field indeed , even as the new training strategy moves forward , american units are substantially withdrawing from iraq s streets with the country sliding closer to civil war , iraqi military units , many of them of uncertain quality , are now taking the leading combat role in nearly half of iraq s territory plans are in the works to reduce the american troop commitment , to possibly fewer than 100 , 000 by the end of the year from around 130 , 000 now on some bases , far from trying out a new strategy , american soldiers are staying back more than ever , and grumbling , in some cases , that they spend more time watching videos and eating at base canteens than fighting
new approach to book club about eight years ago , toni coxburns , a white plains activist , noticed an explosion of reading groups among africanamerican women which she attributed to the increasing number of africanamerican authors being published that gave her an idea for a forum for a wider group of readers and literary enthusiasts to come together , she said , and discuss the books i thought , why do n't we get the authors to talk to everyone and share their work and their inspiration \? she approached the westchester library system , whose 38 member libraries help supply books to reading groups around the county , and suggested an event similar to the system s yearly book and author luncheon , where ideas are discussed over quiche and coffee in an elegant setting her efforts led to the annual africanamerican writers and readers literary tea , which ms coxburns said was an immediate success , attracting a soldout crowd every year since 1999 the library system will sponsor the eighth annual tea on jan 16 , martin luther king s birthday , from 3 30 to 6 pm at abigail kirsch s tappan hill in tarrytown this year s guest writers include jill nelson , author of finding martha s vineyard \( doubleday \) grace f edwards , author of the viaduct \( doubleday \) martha southgate , author of third girl from the left \( houghton mifflin \) and eric v copage , author of between father and son \( harpercollins \) information \( 914 \) 2313226 choral director dies timothy vernon , the popular music director of the choral arts society , based in briarcliff manor , died on dec 28 at age 60 the cause was pneumonia a pianist , harpsichordist and organist , he conducted many opera productions at places like the aspen music festival and purchase college , and led the yale philharmonic and other groups in the united states , canada , europe and south america he had led the arts society since 1990 penelope cassar , president of the arts society , said mr vernon was known for his sensitive and understanding approach to shaping the sound of an avocational chorus he was a superb musician with wonderful knowledge and understanding of music , she said but he was also able to direct amateurs to do more than we ever thought we were capable of doing the way he did that was by being gentle other conductors might storm and threaten , but mr vernon was the opposite , ms cassar said this man never lost his temper , she said if a chord was not correct , he 'd find a witty way of telling us we always tried especially hard for him because of his kind and nurturing manner the last time he directed the chorus was on dec 4 , she said , when the chorus performed part of the sch \? requiem for hospice patients he had a cough , and we were saying go to the doctor , but he said he wanted to get the music done , she said mr vernon was also the music director of the church of st mary the virgin in chappaqua a list of remembrances of the conductor can be found on the arts society s web site at www choralartssociety org one writer , sarah lake rodriguez , wrote , his voice always filled any room with warmth and humor bandtoband combat eight groups will vie against one another in the battle of the bands on jan 14 from 7 30 pm to midnight at the westchester county center in white plains the contestants , selected from audition tapes , are bellevue , none the wiser and tonight at ten , all from yonkers driftwood , from port chester pandora s mistake , from thornwood raging bon heures , from trumbull , conn the remedies , from bedford and the tragic , from tuckahoe the young participants musicians must be between the ages of 15 and 20 to qualify are overwhelmingly male , with only one female member in the combined group of 32 players this year about 25 bands submitted tapes , said joe lemischak , recreation supervisor for the westchester county parks , recreation and conservation department , which sponsors the event with the county department of dwi public safety and other groups there s a lot of hard rock , he said of the bands chosen most of it is original stuff the winning band receives free studio time admission is 3 \( 914 \) 8647000 roberta hershenson

in the hours after the terrorist attacks of sept 11 , 2001 , the three suffolk county radio stations owned by the morey organization began carrying the audio from wnbctv , channel 4 , in new york when the august 2003 blackout occurred , the stations switched to the audio from news 12 long island , the cable tv channel the company s stations had to turn to other outlets for news coverage because none of them wlirfm in hampton bays , wbonfm in westhampton and wdrefm in calverton have a news department the morey stations are not alone only a few of the 19 commercial am and fm stations on long island have their own news departments those that broadcast any news at all generally just take wireservice reports and read them on the air , as the morey stations did before eliminating news entirely in a format change in september only one station has a reporter working in the field walkfm in patchogue gina m degregorio , a spokeswoman for the morey organization , said we 're trying to hit a younger demographic older listeners like walk , which has a news department we 've always stayed musicfocused , and if there was any talk , it was an interview with a band news is n't something that our audience looked for if they wanted news , they would turn to wins jaci clement , the executive director of the fair media council , a notforprofit mediawatch organization , and gary lewi , a senior vice president of rubenstein associates and a former radio reporter , said that news staffs were cut out at many stations after the deregulation of radio in 1996 what followed on the long island dial reflected a national trend , mr lewi said a consolidation of radio station ownership and a massive reduction in community identity much of public affairs programming and locally originated news used to be mandated , he said when that was dropped , the industry went into a free fall , and it became an economic equation beyond walk and its lone reporter , david north , local radio news coverage is left to the island s college stations , ms clement said , but no college station blankets long island or has 24hour news david widmer is the president and general manager of the long island radio group he said his stations \( whliam and wkjyfm in hempstead , wbzofm in bay shore and wmjcfm in smithtown \) have a news director , but no reporters on the street because of the expense there is a business model involved in this , he said we are not news radio stations our first and foremost business is entertainment that is true for the morey organization , too , but john caracciolo , its president , said the company was looking at putting in a permanent link between our facility and news 12 an engineer at the station could then switch quickly to carrying the cable channel s audio feed if needed ms clement said that the fair media council had begun an effort to match long island radio stations with television and newspaper reporters on the island who could provide local news to the stations in the event of an emergency say we are expecting a hurricane , and we all needed to get off long island , she said you need to have information to tell you what to do and when to leave , and the only way to get that is through the radio ms clement said that the new york city stations would be too busy with city problems to provide extensive long island coverage bob buchmann , who was vice president for programming at wbab in babylon during the 1980 s and 1990 s , said that when he left in 1999 , they fired my street reporter , and news ended on long island except for walk it s a real sin , said mr buchmann , who is the program director of waxqfm in new york city it is a little bit sad that , aside from local news on walkfm , the only place to get comprehensive local news is either on tv or in print it comes down to format and finances , he said some stations would prefer the walltowall music approach , and they are not necessarily wrong , mr buchmann said , but it just seems there should be more than one street reporter on long island radio one station , wlngfm in sag harbor , does pride itself on covering its community its slogan is live and truly local the station does more than 250 remote broadcasts a year and 14 local newscasts each weekday morning , filled with overnight developments , local police and fire reports , and even local obituaries , said gary sapiane , its vice president onair employees also interview local residents a car fire is a big story for us , because people hear the fire whistle and want to know where the fire is , he said we have a live , instudio color weather radar , so we can watch when a storm is coming and tell people it is approaching in the next 10 minutes walk broadcasts news each morning , seven days a week , and it carries oneminute headline reports produced by newsday at 12 55 pm and 5 55 pm each weekday although there are no other regularly scheduled newscasts at walk , mr north , the station s reporter , said that someone at newsday will go on the air when a major news event breaks , and that he will go to the scene himself a decade ago , walk had newscasts regularly from 4 am to 7 pm , and had five employees in its news department , according to rob miller , the station s program director now it has just two fulltime news people , mr north and the news director , donna vaughan mr miller said the cutbacks came after research showed that the internet had become more important to people and that many offices had television sets and cable service we found that people wanted to know about breaking news , and not just a rehashing of the news from the morning , he said when big things happen , he said , our onair personalities can go on the air and relay the information but many of the island s radio stations are automated and have no disc jockeys on sept 15 , the morey organization s three stations did away with onair personalities in favor of a musiconly format , except for weekends each hour is sponsored by a single advertiser , who gets four 20 to 30second commercial breaks in the hour the new format is doing so well that the morey organization plans to sell it in other markets as an answer to satellite and internet radio because there are no disc jockeys to pay and fewer commercials to produce , mr caracciolo said , the company s expenses are reduced and the net cash is higher

many times through the years , a firsttime novelist has asked me what he or she can expect from being published how will my life change \? it usually takes until the third beer to get to this question , and i usually try to duck the true response which is that nothing really changes my publisher in new york , karen rinaldi , calls this waiting period before publication , the calm before the calm a limousine packed with scotch , thomas pynchon and cher never arrive at your front doorstep most of the people in your life don t read anything , so they probably won t read your book , and even if they do , all they re looking for is bits that sound like themselves maybe you ll do a radio interview maybe you ll do a signing and then insert image of tumbleweeds here because i started out writing for magazines , i got used to the notion of being published , whereas many writers come from university literature programs where publication ranks right up there with beatification and annunciation in terms of personal transformation should i have a really big launch party \? good god , no launch parties are a waste of money spend that money on advertising get over yourself should i tour \? well , yes if you can in the old days \( pre , say , 2004 \) one toured because it gave the local papers a chance to do something along the lines of doug was physically here in philadelphia , and because of that , we caught up with him and had a chat , which will appear in a weekend arts section , and hopefully on the front page above the fold these days when you arrive in a city , people say , oh , you we ve seen and read everything about you on google already we heard you had rice krispies for breakfast is this true \? so the economics and necessity of touring are rapidly shifting i have a hunch that soon enough touring will be an anachronism along the lines of crossing the atlantic on the queen mary people used to do that \? i ve been to only a few book readings other than my own the reason is that once i hear an author s voice reading his or her own work , i can never read that author again without that voice replacing my own inner narrator s voice i love margaret drabble , but it s so hard to read her now i heard her read from radiant way , and that was over 20 years ago , but i can t shake her voice , and it s a very nice voice , too i once went to a michael chabon reading , and he pronounced the word , saxophonist to rhyme with sarcophagus , and to this day , if i read his stuff , a voice in the depths of my subconscious shouts out every 10 seconds saxophonist ! saxophonist ! kurt vonnegut is one exception to this rule i can t imagine reading him without his signature doomsday croak bouncing about my cranium the best live reader in the world , bar none , is irvine welsh in person he s almost mute , but put him on a stage and he electrifies , and his profanities sound more like onomatopoeias than profanities the new york times won t allow me to offer examples things that can go wrong in a bookstore reading usually you can take a disaster and turn it to your advantage for example , crying babies become enthusiastic readers of tomorrow i ve found that once you acknowledge something annoying , it almost immediately loses its capacity to annoy these days i mostly do theater readings and events where nothing ever goes wrong , and it s an eerie feeling , waiting for a disaster that never comes i almost don t feel right unless someone decides to foam up an espresso right in the middle of a solemn passage

paul krugman responds to readers comments on his dec 4 column ,  phil doell , wadsworth , ohio i don t agree that iraq will fall into a huge civil war when not if we pull out iraq is like a bunch of siblings who fight continually because their parents get into their problems and referee everything when parents stop interfering , the siblings are forced to settle things on their own we should let the iraqis own their problems and stop being enablers ! during vietnam , we were told that if the us pulled out the domino effect would spread communism across all of southeast asia but it didn t happen paul krugman i hope you re right , but once hatred has been unleashed , it s hard to stop about vietnam the domino effect didn t happen , but terrible massacres , especially in cambodia , did my point is that even so , we re not doing any good by staying richard greene , hopewell , nj i ve rarely , if ever , disagreed with anything you ve written in your column , but today i do its deeply saddening , tragic , to ask anyone be the last to die in a misguided war , but its no longer just a matter of a bully s ego i ve opposed the iraq war since the beginning , but now that we re in it , we re responsible for the civil war it s unleashed and we d be irresponsible to walk away without offering those engaged in it every reasonable opportunity to back away from the destructive course on which they ve embarked i m also concerned that our failure to do that could result in intervention in iraq by neighboring countries or groups from neighboring countries , a wider regional war with its obvious negative consequences for the world economy , and the rise of more islamist governments in the region it seems to me that it would be better to set a deadline , of a year to eighteen months , for the beginning of withdrawal , rather than beginning one now , so as to offer those iraqis who are relatively moderate an opportunity to back the country down from the destructive course on which it has entered and for neighboring countries to bring pressure to bear on the iraqis toward that end a fixed time period would create pressure for this while allowing us to do what we can to facilitate the process it might also allow time for passions to subside and reason to prevail a phased withdrawal beginning immediately or soon without a deadline would allow the iraqis and neighbors to continue on their present risky course while reducing the forces we have available to facilitate a peace process however , more than your seeming support for a phased withdrawal , i disagree with your characterization of the war at this point as asking a man to be the last to die for a bully s ego unfortunately its become more than that i have another thought that i d like to see someone write about whether we should support partition of iraq is a difficult question the costs would be enormous , but those who oppose partition always assume that we would simply approve of it , walk away and let the likely ethnic cleansing proceed there is an alternative namely , providing aid for the resettlement of those who would be left behind as minorities in sunni or shiitedominated areas such an effort might provide a useful precedent for resolving other conflicts involving ethnically or religiously intermingled populations there is a potential for many such conflicts , particularly in africa paul krugman i appreciate your sentiments but my read on the news coming out of iraq is that neither the united states , nor wellintentioned iraqis , has much ability to affect events at this point us troops control the ground they stand on , and no more al maliki isn t really in charge much of shiite iraq has already been partitioned among various militias so for whom are we setting deadlines \? michael , pasadena , calif i hope the democrats vigorously challenge bush in the public policy arena and make the next two years less bad than they otherwise would be but webb s gratuitously snotty response to an innocent inquiry accomplishes nothing paul krugman that doesn t sound snotty to me it sounds like the off the cuff reaction of a father who is terrified about his son s fate \( a vehicle next to webb s son had just been blown up , killing several marines \) and bush could have just let webb s comment ride instead he snapped at him , and i don t see how webb can be blamed for getting mad l ruth , bethesda , md i almost never disagree with you , but here s a rare case while i agree that challenging us policy in iraq is a good thing , the jim webb george bush exchange is a frail reed on which to build your case as well , yours is the first account of the bush webb exchange that suggests that bush snapped at webb most accounts have suggested that webb s response , made at a white house reception for incoming members of congress , was equally impolite and impolitic i don t dispute your larger point that public challenge of the administration s policies is warranted but believe that these challenges should be made in more appropriate settings , not at social events too , senatorelect webb could reduce his effectiveness on capitol hill if he continues to make his points unduly harshly paul krugman of course bush snapped at webb what was that line about that s not what i asked if not a snippy comeback can we stop pretending that bush is a gracious , decent man , even in person \? it s common knowledge that he s nothing of the sort and full accounts suggest that webb tried to avoid talking to bush , who he understandably blames for putting his son in grave danger bush sought him out and it was just a natural human reaction for webb to forsake the niceties dan gardella , new york well , your bravo to james webb for his discourteous behavior is misplaced for the following reasons one , basic courtesy and respect for the office a person holds , if not the person holding that office , should require at least a bit of civility on the part of the newly minted senator that exchange tells us more about mr webb then it says about mr bush second , while the exchange reflects an its none of your business approach to the president that you seem to approve of , but you fail to note that mr webb s son is a lance corporal in the us marine corps and the last i looked , his commanding officer is the president of the united states , and that makes his well being very much the president s business a general review of mr webb s history postvietnam shows that , if the mood hits him , he turns quickly on his friends and bites the hand that feeds him so be careful what you wish for you may get it paul krugman from my article i d like to get them out of iraq , mr president , replied mr webb , whose son , a marine lance corporal , is risking his life in mr bush s war of choice read before you write lee lanza , malden , mass your excellent column raises the question of whether bush can be influenced by any means , short of impeachment nixon never felt he had done anything wrong , yet somehow key republicans persuaded him to resign bush doesn t care what the republican party or anyone else thinks of him , so i don t see him resigning to prevent political damage to others i am not sure that even concern for his own historical reputation would motivate him to admit any mistakes he is not a strong enough personality to deal with gray areas , doubts , or complications
i was taken in twice peter windsor of speed channel has been snagging people in the paddock in budapest to ask them who they think will be world champion , fernando alonso or michael schumacher he stopped me and i had a little think about it and said , fernando when i say that i had a think , what i was thinking about was not so much who and why , but rather whether i should say anything for at least a couple of years now i have ceased making predictions about anything ie , who will win a championship , who will win this race or that race there are far too many unpredictable factors for any reasonable , intelligent choice to be made that is to say , who s to say that michael schumacher will not be knocked off the track in budapest at the first corner and fernando wins then suddenly there will be 21 points between them \? who s to say that the inverse will not happen and there will be only one point between them \? what if it rains at all the rest of the races and some other team proves to be far better in the wet than either renault or ferrari \? \( all right , that s maybe stretching it a bit , but you never know ! \) that is why i no longer make predictions maybe that is also why yesterday frank williams refused to answer another journalist s question on who he thought would win the title no idea , williams said the journalist then said he had asked five other team principals and they had all responded michael that means that at least half the team principals are voting for michael so , why did i blurt out that alonso would win \? as i said above , i was thinking more about whether or not i should respond and when finally i thought too much time had lapsed , i blurted out alonso because that was my intuition , not a reasoned response reasoning would say that ferrari has returned and that renault is on the way down reasoning would say that schumacher will win the last title of his career and then quit the sport and ferrari will drop into a period of having to rebuild itself but how nice to go out with a bang reasoning would say fernando s and renault s minds were already wondering what next year would bring when they part ways and so they will dip in performance just long enough for ferrari to goose the championship away from them but none of these things can really be predicted i am not trying to retract what i said about my intuition on alonso i ll let it stand i suppose that in the end it takes a little bit of guts to make a prediction since one can look foolish if one is proved wrong , and maybe that s the real reason i have stopped doing it the other way i have been taken in is by deciding to continue this trend of asking other people who they think will win the title i m not going to ask anyone in the paddock , but would any of you like to risk a prediction \? if things really come down to the wire , i may do a well reasoned and researched story about it within the next couple of races but in the meantime , with ferrari looking strong and only 11 points between them , who do you see as winning the title , alonso or schumacher \?
the mystic aquarium and institute for exploration is going into the restaurant and bar business next month , a forprofit subsidiary of the aquarium s parent organization will open the first of three restaurants called the blue turtle in the connecticut post mall in milford the other blue turtles are scheduled to open this fall in the shoppes at buckland hills mall in manchester and the westchester mall in white plains , ny the blue turtle , despite its name and its owner , will not have an aquatic theme , nor will the target audience be families the restaurant , aimed at customers 21 to 45 years old , will have computer games built into the bar , virtual reality games and simulators large flatscreen televisions will also enable people to play games against one another or watch sporting events the menu will include hamburgers , ribs , steaks and pasta and while the snack bar at the aquarium does not sell seafood , the blue turtle will salmon , lobster , calamari , shrimp and clam chowder will be served the move is part of a plan by the aquarium , a nonprofit education and research organization , to bolster its revenues so that it can offer new exhibits and improve its financial health annual attendance has remained flat at about 700 , 000 the aquarium has lost money over the last few years and has struggled to pay off the remaining 19 million in longterm debt for the renovation and expansion that was completed in 2000 we 're responding to the realities of the marketplace today , which tell us that a standalone education and research center will have a hard time making it , said steve coan , the chief operating officer of the aquarium tim mullany , the aquarium s chief financial officer , said the longterm plan was to open at least two new blue turtles between boston and washington each year he said that opening in the westchester made sense because the area s average household net worth and mall spending was second to none mr mullany and mr coan have compared the blue turtle to dave buster s and the espn zone , large entertainmentfilled restaurants in urban centers the blue turtles will be in 13 , 000squarefoot spaces in suburban shopping malls the restaurants have been designed by the cunningham group , a minneapolis firm that created the rain forest cafe and themepark attractions like the back to the future ride at universal studios in florida and in california the only mention of the restaurant s connection to the aquarium will come on the menus , which will say that the proceeds benefit the sea research foundation , the parent organization jim farrell , vice president for operations for the connecticut restaurant association , said he was surprised that the restaurant s connection to the aquarium would be so subtle you would think they would play that up a little more , he said cross marketing is such an important aspect of doing business today mr mullany , who is also chief executive of the mystic entertainment company , the subsidiary set up to run the restaurants , said the aquarium s board of trustees wanted to keep the two entities separate the aquarium has its own mission , and they did n't want to do anything to affect that brand , he said we also wanted a generic concept we did n't want to become a theme restaurant in the connecticut post mall , the restaurant will be on the second level it will be about 100 feet from the mall s food court and take up two store spaces , one of which is vacant and another that most recently housed a women s apparel store the buckland hills restaurant will be in a section of the former sears store , while the one in white plains will be on the foodcourt level the milford and manchester locations will have outdoor patios art butterfield , a senior leasing manager for the westfield group , which owns the connecticut post mall and 66 other shopping centers , said that he could see the blue turtle becoming a national chain malls are very interested in having the first showing of a cuttingedge restaurant , he said it s a completely new idea there s plenty of demand for something like this mr farrell called the blue turtle a bold move for a nonprofit institution , but said he understood that such organizations had to look for new sources of revenue to survive if they do it right and put it in the right place where the market is , they 'll get people in there , he said it s a great concept we 'll see if the public latches on to it but the one thing the public will not see is an actual blue turtle according to the aquarium , blue turtles do n't exist we 're creating the species , mr mullany said photo the blue turtle will open next month in the connecticut post mall in milford , but the restaurant will not have an aquatic theme \( photo by thomas mcdonald for the new york times \)

ashley kahn was in one of those sublime yet ridiculous situations a few years ago when he stumbled upon his writerly epiphany he had spent most of the previous dozen years as a road or tour manager for rock acts and he happened to be in memphis helping run a tour for britney spears i had taken some of the dancers over to graceland for a tour during the afternoon and , at the same time , i was editing a piece on the 40th anniversary of 'kind of blue , ' one of miles davis s masterpieces , he said so there i was on the cellphone on a bench at graceland trying to explain modal jazz to an editor while britney s dancers were , i do n't know , crying at elvis s grave it was pretty funny right then and there , he knew it was time to get off the road and into his head that moment led to his first book , kind of blue the making of the miles davis masterpiece \( da capo press , 16 \) , and now mr kahn has finished his third jazz book this decade , happy to be nesting in his fort lee apartment office instead of traveling that book , out this month , is the house that trane built the story of impulse records \( w w norton , 2995 \) impulse was one of the top jazz record labels of the postworld war ii era the book recounts how impulse , a subsidiary label of abc , was able to survive and thrive in the rockrecord heyday of the 1960 s and 1970 s , despite concentrating on complex avantgarde jazz impulse s bestknown artist during the 1960 s was john coltrane , clearly one of mr kahn s heroes his philosophy was part of his sound , mr kahn said of coltrane mr kahn s second book in his current trilogy was a love supreme the story of john coltrane s signature album \( penguin , 15 \) his music was sincere , autobiographical , he said he was someone who was forever humble , forever trying to move the music forward he did n't buy into the limitations of category and genre in fact , music and life were one in the same for him this whole story of impulse is a window on a time when that was able to be , when people were searching for ways to connect jazz , classical , rock , whatever mr kahn bought his first copy of a love supreme when he was 16 in his hometown , cincinnati i picked up a mott the hoople album that day , too , so i clearly was n't a jazz purist , he said jazz , for me , flowed into my awareness like all genres did i did n't explore rock and then move into jazz as some kind of grownup thing i just listened to what i liked , and discarded what i did n't mr kahn went to columbia university , he says , to learn to write then did so , about music after graduating in 1983 , he took a range of jobs in the music business , moving to new orleans for a few years and then coming back to new york to work for the city in its central park summer concert series by his late 20 s , mr kahn was managing musical tours , first with the south african a cappella group ladysmith black mambazo , then with their american benefactor paul simon , then with singers like cassandra wilson and peter gabriel it was a wonderful time , but after a couple of years , i got tired of the road and the bus , he said the whole charm and glitz of the road eventually wears off , even with good people and good destinations i worked with great music and i looked forward to every show , but not every night is saturday night and not every morning should feel like monday morning , which it got to be all along , he tried to write freelance articles on music some were published in rolling stone and downbeat , and eventually rolling stone editors asked him to help update the magazine s jazz and blues album guide it was the doorway i was looking for to get back into writing , mr kahn said , especially the book side of things some of mr kahn s writing in the house that trane built is admittedly breathless but what albums ! he wrote of the two mr coltrane made for impulse in 1964 both were of lasting , iconic stature both sounded a tranquil departure from his frenetic path of development , a stylistic resting point that seemed to reflect a calming satisfaction with his personal life mr kahn agreed that he effuses a bit , but said it is difficult to explain music without the presence of the music itself music writing has the odd impact of isolating itself , he said it is talmudic in some ways it is like taking the torah and protecting the words it is difficult to be both hip enough for musicians and open to the layman it should be open to everyone , including people who do n't read cd reviews mr kahn often does his best work on pieces for morning edition on national public radio , which are archived on the npr web site \( www npr org \) there , he gets to direct listeners to the music , which then is a showcase for his pieces , which are mostly on jazz musicians who are not anywhere near as famous as mr coltrane one of his recent stories , though , was on the avantrock group the flaming lips i love that format because you get to play the music , not just write about it , mr kahn said you get to go straight to the moment with the flaming lips , not just tell people about them despite having an urban bent , mr kahn loves the idea of living in fort lee , across the george washington bridge from manhattan you have the exotic sort of atmosphere you get in manhattan , he said i live with a lot of the asian community , so i go to all the korean and japanese restaurants what i associate with manhattan is right here , the multiethnic community plus , i can get to the best jazz clubs in the world in new york in 20 minutes , and i am 30 minutes away , at rutgers in newark , from the best jazz archive in the world , the institute for jazz studies , without which none of my books would be possible plus , i can afford a twobedroom condo here with parking , and my view is of manhattan , he said how can you beat that \? mr kahn s summer will include some new writing and his other love , softball i am single and healthy and in two leagues , said mr kahn , who said he plans to write a book about landmark hollywood movies and their impact on the broader culture my saturday game is writers i prefer the left side of the infield shortstop and third base i think i am pretty good in that crowd , and i bring the best music photos ashley kahn , who lives in fort lee , has written another book about jazz the house that trane built the story of impulse records is out
thirteen years ago , the village of garden city rode to the rescue of the old cathedral school of st paul s on stewart avenue , sparing the ruskinian gothic brick landmark from demolition by buying the former boys' prep school and its grounds for 85 million now the village is faced with having to play a decidedly less heroic role in the narrative of saving st paul s after a long search for a way to preserve and reuse the deteriorating building without burdening taxpayers , the village has been told by its consultants that it cannot be done the only feasible option , the consulting report said , was to sell the building , most likely to a developer who would gut it and build luxury condominiums inside the shell the report , by the firm of k backus associates , was presented to village trustees dec 15 backed by an overwhelming yes vote on a bond referendum , the village bought the 48acre property in 1993 from the episcopal archdiocese of long island most of the grounds were quickly turned into a park with public athletic fields but the school building , listed on the national register of historic places , has been left in limbo , as one proposal after another for putting it to some combination of public and private use foundered on the same problem that led the archdiocese to close the school cost the school was built in 1883 by cornelia m stewart as a memorial to her husband , alexander t stewart , one of the wealthiest people of his time , who founded and laid out garden city in the middle of the 19th century on vast stretches of farmland he had acquired northwest of hempstead the school building was in poor condition when the village acquired it and has deteriorated since then as it lay vacant , its walls crumbling and its mansard roof sagging and leaking the village has done minimal maintenance , patching holes in the roof , sealing broken windows and lighting the exterior at night but even that has cost 100 , 000 a year estimates for rehabilitating the building to meet modern building codes start at 32 million tearing it down would be expensive , too , running to perhaps 6 million preservationists say razing st paul s would be a great loss it s a remarkable building , said charla bolton of the society for the preservation of long island antiquities i do n't know of another building of that style , magnitude and that quality on long island the building s quality and deteriorating condition led the new york state preservation league to include it on its 2003 seven to save list of historic buildings that are most threatened many local people , too , would hate to see it go when a landmark is removed , suddenly it s not the same place anymore , said john ellis kordes , the village historian it s not just a building coming down , he said you 're actually changing the character of the village one warmish sunday recently , peter bonchonsky and his two sons strayed away from the park s playing fields to examine the buildings up close , as they have often done for years they hunted for decadesold graffiti scratched into corner bricks by st paul s students here s one from the 1800 s , mr bonchonsky said , to shouts of where \? from his sons c n 1893 , he read aloud we love the building , mr bonchonsky said it enriches us so much just to be at the foot of it over the years , several ideas have been advanced to adapt parts of the building for public use as a library , perhaps , or an assistedliving facility or village hall none have yielded a plan that would insulate village taxpayers from any net cost , a condition the village has insisted on the report by k backus said that such a plan was not possible if the trustees adopt the firm s recommendations , the village will try to sell the school building and the nearly 10 acres of land immediately around it while the village could impose some restrictions in the sale , such as limiting development to the current eshaped footprint of the building , the consultants' report said that developers would not be attracted to buy the property if any interior spaces had to be preserved it would be pretty much a gut rehab of the interior of the building , but not the fa \? e , said robert schoelle , the village administrator that would mean the removal of the school s chapel , which preservationists had specifically wanted to save local civic groups and preservationists expressed disappointment with the report , saying that there ought to be room in the building for both public and private uses , paid for with creative financing we 're not resisting the idea that there could also be private enterprise within the space , said edmund keating , who lives about a mile from st paul s we just think this is too precious a property , too precious a building , to turn over to a private developer to build 75 private highend condominiums mayor gerard lundquist said the building would be sold for market value mr schoelle said the village would employ k backus to market the property to developers in the spring , for a fee of 155 , 000 the consultants' report did not assess what the property might bring in a sale , but estimated that once it had been converted to condominiums , it would yield about 10 million in property taxes over 20 years local preservation groups said that they planned to sue the village to stop a sale , arguing that the marketing arrangement with k backus is illegal , according to the groups' lawyer , michael ciaffa of meyer , suozzi , english and klein ms bolton , of the antiquities preservation society , questioned the consulting report s conclusion that the whole interior had to be gutted and converted to private use i was n't totally confident of the numbers , ms bolton said of the report she cited as a model the centuryold main street school building in port washington , which has been successfully converted to a mixture of public uses by theater and community groups on the lower floors and senior housing above peter negri , a former village trustee who once proposed relocating the village s public library to st paul s , said that two local committees concerned with st paul s had joined forces to draw up an alternative plan for public and private use to sell the property , the village would need approval from the state legislature and the governor in a form known as a home rule bill kemp hannon , who represents garden city in the state senate , said the village had never asked him to introduce such a bill i 've been waiting and waiting , and saying you should come up with some general agreement with the community , so we can go forward , mr hannon said such a bill would have to be detailed and comprehensive , he said we want to make sure there are no windfall profits , no crossing of the expectations of the community , mr hannon said this is a public trust photos the fate of the cathedral school of st paul s has been undecided for years as several proposals to rejuvenate the deteriorating building have foundered over cost a consultant s solution sell the school \( photographs by phil marino for the new york times \)

as the mets charged into this year s postseason , their cityskyline logo suddenly appeared on magazine covers , on pencils displayed near grocery checkouts and on bumper stickers sold at gasoline stations but just a few months ago and for many years before that , through thick and mostly thin there was hardly a trace of mets gear to be found my son james and i would trudge from store to store in search of a mets backpack or even just a lunch box , deliberately ignoring the racks and rows of yankee tank tops , change purses and dog sweaters last year , the manager of a large , local sports warehouse truly trying to help asked , have you considered rooting for the yankees \? james , who was 6 at the time , and i had a long , silent , thoughtful ride home even then , of course , metsemblazoned tchotchkes and memorabilia proliferated online and a few clicks did bring us the coveted backpack but seeing that favorite team s logo out in the world , as yankee fans always do , validates that loyalty , makes it seem meaningful and widespread , which is important for a child this year , of course , meaningfulness does n't need a logo but it does need a perspective as both james and i know , this thrilling season would never be so truly , so characteristically amazing without the struggles that preceded it and i do n't mean the team s struggles before he started first grade , james had already learned that it s tough to be a mets fan , especially in yankeeland here in south orange , nj , trickortreaters often resemble the yankees' starting lineup yankeesthemed parties , with the birthday boy in the derek jeter role , are not unusual our daughter s american girl doll wears a yankee uniform \( a promotional giveaway from a game she attended \) even our local history looks toward the bronx babe ruth and lou gehrig played an exhibition game here in 1929 now the town team wears shirts that say , south orange where legends played in big letters across the back ambitious batters , from tball firsttimers to college varsity veterans , aim at an apartment building on a town thoroughfare , hoping to break a window as legend says gehrig did still , we never wavered even as children , the fans i know accepted the mets as their destiny like being lefthanded , it s occasionally inconvenient , but it s a way of life for me , it s a familial trait i was raised national league by a mets father and a phillies mother when the family landed in northern new jersey , my brother and i gravitated toward shea stadium , where i learned to count change at the concession stand and to score a game correctly , filling in the spaces with satisfying k s when the opposing team s batter struck out my father took us to several seasons' worth of mets games , enough to establish a lifetime loyalty to the team even as their fortunes waxed and waned , and i lived in many places , i answered questions about team preference with , mets , of course if i had carried a backpack , i would have wanted a mets logo on it , which is why i 've been willing to travel hopefully from store to store each year , much as the mets approach those first road games each season the peculiar pull of this team is the repeated disappointment that punctuates its bigleague credentials i 've always seen myself in the players the way they blow opportunities , make spectacular errors and sometimes , just barely , catch a break they either do n't deserve or deserve more than any other team in the world that s baseball s equivalent of missed deadlines , bills paid late , children s homework hastily done and the occasional glorious day when either none of that matters or all of it does on the best of good days , i'm willie randolph , my children are a welltrained team , and my suburb is a soldout night game at shea more often , my met life is a rainout followed by a grueling doubleheader on the road and bad news about the pitcher s throwing arm my high school buddy , a queens transplant , and i used to listen to mets games on a transistor radio in his yard when his mother sent us outside to weed the vegetable garden i remember lying in spring s damp grass , which dried to nothing in the heat of late summer and revived for the playoffs even then , back in the 1980 s , it was an apt metaphor for the mets' seasons this year , for the first time in recent memory , i look forward to reading the sports pages after the mets swept the division title , their logo swept the stores with equal bravado , often replacing large yankee displays entire windows of sportinggoods stores in new york city are now filled with mets gear mets tshirts are being advertised in south orange advertised ! at several stores , along with enough backpacks for every child in the tristate area i see myself less clearly in this success story , but that s ok if my mets have a golden season , there s reason to think that i 'll have the same so i'm feeling an unfamiliar exuberance in gleeful anticipation of dare i say it \? a world series title , i decide to buy some party clothes , a new tshirt for myself and a hat for james as a veteran fan , though , my exuberance is tempered , just slightly , by experience browsing through the array of mets gear , i choose a backpack that i hide from james it s for next year just in case we 're all disappointed and it s back to the same old and the mets logo vanishes from sight like a foul ball into a fan s mitt because being a mets fan means celebrating victories a stolen base , a favorable call at third or a division title when we can , and pragmatically planning for errors it s the lesson of the legacy it s the hardwon wisdom that distinguishes us from fans of that other new york team it sets us apart well , that and the backpacks drawing \( drawing by alex nabaum \)
we 've lost our power where i live , there is nothing spiritual , psychological or political about these words they are dire , referring to a physical circumstance they mean that a utility pole or tree has fallen somewhere , wires are down , and the house has no electricity tropical storm ernesto in september was the cause of our most recent power failure , and while it lasted a mere 13 hours , shorter , more spontaneous power failures that seem to occur in the absence of any weatherrelated event have become routine in our area as well there is something about a house without power it has no hum , none of the soft background noises of the furnace , pump or refrigerator , none of the chirping of the computer , phone and fax that subtly reassure you that life is going on a silence and stillness , an invasive quiet , or maybe disquiet , settles in and with it comes uncertainty , because when the power is to be restored is as unpredictable as when it may go later , sometimes much later , comes that slightly magical moment when the house springs back to life , lights on , all the appliances resuming their improvisational rondeau part of the relief of coming through a blackout lies in knowing we have just endured an excursion to some province of uncertainty in his essay selfreliance , ralph waldo emerson observes that with consistency a great soul has simply nothing to do while i lay no claims for my soul , i know that a blackout is a genuine cure for consistency routines are upended , schedules are thwarted , work remains undone still , we manage to manage , bearing out another of emerson s assertions , which is that we thrive by casualties but whether our casualty lasts for three minutes , three hours or three days , it still always raises the question of whether to get a generator so far , we have n't not that we do n't think about it with winter upon us , i leaf through homeequipment magazines and tool catalogs and review my options with the obsessive fascination of paris hilton eyeing the runway during fashion week smart homeowner magazine assures me that power failures lasting more than 24 hours have tripled in this country since 1978 , presumably on account of our ravenous energy consumption and wornout infrastructure and i learned from a phone call to the new york state public service commission that while the frequency of power failures in the state has leveled off in the last five years , their duration has increased the web site for a manufacturer of generators went so far as to track the path of hurricane florence churning its way up the atlantic , all but promising me a blackout in my immediate future generators fall into two categories , standby and portable , the chief difference being that the first comes on automatically within seconds of a power failure while the other needs to be switched on manually standbys are generally installed permanently on concrete pads outdoors , while portables are just that \( all of them , though , must be operated outside , as they produce carbon monoxide fumes \) my head is turned by a standby liquidcooled number that runs on natural gas and has something called an ultraquiet whisper test feature , but its price tag of close to 8 , 000 seems extravagant , and i know i could get by just as well with a lowrent option priced under 1 , 000 with a sixgallon fuel tank , it provides continuous power for 10 or 12 hours if the power failure lasts longer , you can just refuel the one i would probably settle for lies somewhere in between , a portable unit with a 16gallon fuel tank that costs 2 , 000 there is something reassuring about knowing that it can generate electricity for a full 24 hours without refueling there is no such thing as too much power , says its ad copy , underscoring its dependability and like anyone newly infatuated , i reconsider my future , in which our old clapboard farmhouse becomes some epicenter of power and productivity yet for all the lust i try to summon up for one of these , no one i know who has a generator loves it all that much for all the security it offers , it s a piece of equipment that seems to elicit nothing so much as ambivalence it is an essential evil , says anne kreamer , a former neighbor of mine in dutchess county who bought a generator for her house there its smell , fumes and noise are all loathsome , but i would do anything not to have my pipes freeze years earlier , she and her family had come home one frigid night after a power failure to find the interior of their house encrusted with glaciers a generator , she says , is lifesupport for the house it s not about a freezer full of rotting meat it s for the pipes and she made it a point never to turn on the generator during summer blackouts the windows are all open , so with all the noise and fumes of the generator , it s like sleeping next to the bqe instead , she would light the coleman lanterns and just make do that ambivalence makes sense to me it is , after all , at the root of my own indecisiveness , which i know is not just about the house , but about whether owning a generator signals efficiency and resourcefulness or coddled incompetence i also know that the purchase of a generator that offers 3 , 000 hours of uninterrupted power is only partly about excessive cold or heat , a refrigerator full of spoiling food , empty faucets , the darkness , the silence what it is most about is the acknowledgment that we 're on our own indefinitely continuity and constancy are at the core of our sense of security today , and i suspect that unexpected disruptions whether they are a few dropped minutes of cellphone service , the unannounced arrival of an electronic worm or a twoday power failure undermine it deeply which brings me back to emerson , who urged his readers to become conversant with the unexpected the world uncertain comes and goes , he said in a simple statement that implies gracious acceptance of that fact i consider as well the stamina that his particular brand of thriving takes and try to imagine whether i can summon up a similar resilience but then , i remind myself , emerson never had the option of owning a guardian quietsource that promised him power anytime , anywhere drawing \( drawing by matt collins \)

as clusters of openhouse balloons bob across the suburbs of the metropolitan area , from the new englandy enclaves of fairfield county to the saltsprayed boroughs of the jersey shore , the question remains whither the housing market \? everyone , it seems , has an answer , and those answers can be strangely contradictory and accurate at the same time if inventory is your gauge , the market is slackening if prices are your prism , it s still going strong but in interviews with more than two dozen real estate agents , buyers , sellers and economists , the consensus is that the housing market in the region remains remarkably buoyant but is coming down to earth prices are still in the clouds , but inventory is expanding , sales volume declining and bidding wars , once commonplace , increasingly rare in short , the boom is over yet there is no bust in sight it s turning , said pearl m kamer , chief economist for the long island association , the island s largest business organization it s neither a buyer s nor a seller s market buyers say they no longer feel pressured to make an offer the moment they step over the doorsill \( there are even isolated reports of sellers getting lowball offers \) brokers , meanwhile , are lecturing sellers to be more realistic about prices , and sellers are working harder to spruce up their homes a few years ago , sellers were not making their beds and leaving dishes in the sink , and buyers were still coming and buying , said cindy derose , a sales agent for hudson shores realtors in irvington , ny it is still a healthy market but it has cooled down enough that sellers just have to do a little more work , frankly of course , the real estate market in the new york city suburbs has long had its ups and downs but over time , houses there have proved to be extraordinary investments because people want to be close to the city while enjoying the relative safety and good public schools the suburbs offer though the pattern of contradiction in the current market seems fairly consistent from state to state , there are differences from one community to the next , with some towns appearing almost impervious to any downturn , at least for now frank anthony , a sales associate for coldwell banker in mendham , nj , called the current market town sensitive he compared a cape cod in east hanover , nj , for 519 , 900 that has sat on the market for 80 days with a colonial in millburn , nj , that was listed for 775 , 000 and sold in two days mr anthony believes the market is still hot as long as three conditions are met nice house , nice location and nice price for all the talk of a bubble , prices do not seem ready to collapse or even edge south , with the exception of houses whose price tags were plainly inflated brokers say the 1 million mark seems to be a dividing line houses priced for less sell quickly , while houses listed for more are sitting longer and , in some cases , going for less than their list prices the most recent statewide real estate data for new york , new jersey and connecticut show that housing prices continued to appreciate late last year , but at a less breathless clip than the year before according to rae d rosen , a senior economist and assistant vice president for the federal reserve bank of new york , the growth rate in the price of an average house peaked at the same moment in all three states , the third quarter of 2004 new york state saw a 17 percent increase in sales prices for singlefamily houses , over the same quarter in 2003 connecticut , 15 percent , and new jersey , 185 percent by comparison , in the last quarter of 2005 , housing prices in new york rose 126 percent over the year before , 119 percent in connecticut and 146 percent in new jersey westchester county s fourth quarter witnessed a more modest increase of 6 percent and some brokers believe that housing prices may be leveling off it s like going from 60 miles per hour to 30 miles per hour , ms rosen said of the rise in prices we 're just decelerating it looks like the market is moving away from its peak armed with reports of an easing market and steeped in internet research , some buyers are heading to open houses with raised hopes , expecting to find a house or a condominium they can not only afford but also actually want to inhabit some are equating a softening market with falling prices they are often disappointed there does n't seem to be any rhyme or reason to this market , said claudia denatale , who recently toured a lackluster threebedroom condominium in huntington station , ny , listed for 425 , 000 there s been so much talk about the market changing , but i do n't see anything dramatic when you talk about a drop , it should be significant what many buyers do report is greater choice indeed , inventory tight as a noose since 2000 is up across the region , sometimes markedly on long island , the number of unsold houses in january stood at 23 , 470 , a 67 percent jump from the year before inventory in connecticut also rose in fairfield county , the number of houses for sale at the end of last year was 35 percent higher than in late 2004 inventories in some communities \( norwalk , easton , new canaan and darien \) were up more than 50 percent
senate democrats on thursday angrily accused the bush administration of mounting a public relations campaign to defend the national security agency s domestic surveillance program while withholding details of the secret eavesdropping from congressional oversight committees an annual hearing on national security threats , led for the first time by john d negroponte , director of national intelligence , was overtaken by acrimonious partisan debate about the program in response to the democrats' complaints , republicans and top administration intelligence officials said the real problem was leaks about nsa eavesdropping and other classified matters senator john d rockefeller iv of west virginia , the senate intelligence committee s ranking democrat , compared the administration s public disclosures of limited information about the nsa program in the six weeks since it was first disclosed to what he described as a similarly misleading use of intelligence before the war in iraq i am deeply troubled by what i see as the administration s continued effort to selectively release intelligence information that supports its policy or political agenda while withholding equally pertinent information that does not do that , mr rockefeller said another democrat , senator dianne feinstein of california , said the administration had engaged in consistent stonewalling to prevent the intelligence and judiciary committees from carrying out their oversight duties senator carl levin of michigan , suggested the administration s public accounts of the eavesdropping program were contradictory , noting that president bush had described the agency s interception , without court warrants , of a few messages , while michael chertoff , the homeland security secretary , had referred to thousands of messages but none of the republicans on the panel joined the democrats in their criticism and in a statement issued later , senator pat roberts , the kansas republican who is chairman of the committee , accused mr rockefeller and other democrats of derailing the discussion about security threats with their concerns about the eavesdropping program i am concerned that some of my democrat colleagues used this unique public forum to make clear that they believe the gravest threat we face is not osama bin laden and al qaeda , but rather the president of the united states , mr roberts said there is no doubt in my mind there are marching orders to the minority members of this committee to question and attack , at every opportunity , the president , the vice president , the secretary of state , attorney general and now members of our intelligence agencies at the fourhour hearing , mr negroponte and other senior intelligence officials made clear that the decision to limit briefings on the eavesdropping program to just eight members of congress the leaders of the senate and house and the heads of the intelligence committees from both parties had been made by president bush and vice president dick cheney he also objected to the democrats' characterization of the program this was not about domestic surveillance , mr negroponte said it was about dealing with the terrorist threat in the most agile and effective way possible while the senate judiciary committee has scheduled a public hearing next week to explore legal issues surrounding the nsa program , the entire senate intelligence committee has not yet been briefed on it mr roberts tried to head off the democratic attack by announcing that the panel would be briefed in closed session on the program on feb 9 by attorney general alberto r gonzales and gen michael v hayden , principal deputy director of national intelligence in addition , he said , the committee would hold a closed business session on feb 16 to discuss whether to hold further hearings or open an inquiry into the program , as mr rockefeller has urged mr roberts and other republicans said that the most serious issue was the unauthorized leak of sensitive information on intelligence porter j goss , the cia director , concurred , asserting that leaks had done very severe damage to national security and declared that the leakers would be found i 've called in the fbi , the department of justice , mr goss said it is my aim and it is my hope that we will witness a grand jury investigation with reporters present , being asked to reveal who is leaking this information mr negroponte s recitation of a 25page prepared text on threats to the nation , including al qaeda as well as nuclear weapons programs of iran and north korea , contained few surprises he called terrorism the preeminent threat and warned of the consequences of failure in the effort to create a stable iraq we assess that should the jihadists thwart the iraqis' efforts to establish a stable political and security environment , they could secure an operational base in iraq and inspire sympathizers elsewhere to move beyond rhetoric to attempt attacks against neighboring middle eastern nations , europe , and even the united states , said mr negroponte , a former ambassador to iraq but as soon as senators were permitted to question mr negroponte and other spy chiefs who flanked him , an emotional debate ensued over the conduct of the intelligence agencies and the proper degree of public and congressional knowledge of their activities president bush approved the eavesdropping without warrants shortly after the 2001 terrorist attacks , but since the program s existence was revealed in december by the new york times , some legal experts and members of congress have asserted that it violates the foreign intelligence surveillance act in a pointed exchange , senator russell d feingold , democrat of wisconsin , asked mr negroponte whether there were any other intelligence collection programs that had not been revealed to the full intelligence committees mr negroponte replied , senator , i do n't know if i can comment on that in open session in other action on national security , the senate voted 95 to 1 on thursday night for a second fiveweek extension of the antiterrorism law known as the usa patriot act the extension , which was approved by the house on wednesday , now goes to president bush to be signed into law it gives negotiators until march 10 to work out a deal
from the general manager s box on the loge level at yankee stadium , brian cashman noticed something odd in the top of the sixth inning yesterday the yankees' pitcher was about a foot shorter than he should have been it was scott proctor , not randy johnson , who was warming up on the mound to face the kansas city royals johnson had thrown 87 pitches , and the yankees were leading by only three runs cashman waited an inning , then called the trainers in the clubhouse they said , 'it s not a medical issue , ' cashman said i said , 'ok' it was a suspiciously early exit for johnson in an eventual 93 victory , but apparently there was no reason for alarm asked if he would make his next start wednesday in toronto , johnson responded sarcastically i would suspect it , he said , unless i get hit by a car or fall down the steps manager joe torre said that ron guidry , the pitching coach , told him johnson was stiff during yesterday s game , although torre said he did not know where johnson initially scolded reporters for getting the story wrong , but then admitted to some stiffness sort of just a little tired , stiffness in the shoulder , if you want to call it that , he said , adding a disclaimer that seemed to amuse him the right shoulder johnson , a 42yearold lefthander , generally bristles at any suggestion of a physical problem of all he has accomplished , he is proudest of his durability he made 34 starts last season , he reminded reporters only two american league starters made more johnson said there was nothing wrong with his back or his knee , two areas where he receives regular treatment he had dominated the royals through four innings , allowing a single and no other base runners , and the bases were empty with two outs in the fifth then the royals strung together three singles , including two by lefthanded hitters , a sure sign to johnson that his slider was losing its sharpness johnson had thrown more sliders than usual , catcher kelly stinnett said , and none of his five strikeouts came on fastballs guidry said that the long second inning , when the yankees sent seven hitters to the plate and scored three runs , had taken something out of johnson his arm angle was dropping in the fifth , and guidry knew he was finished just general tiredness , guidry said sometimes you go through that when you start off a season and you 're starting to throw a lot of pitches you might run into a game like this early in the season it just catches up to you , the long spring and everything else guidry referred to johnson s pitch counts in his first two starts 106 over seven innings on opening night and 97 in a completegame loss last saturday johnson , who flopped in his playoff start last fall before a strong relief outing , is conscious of saving pitches when he can i do n't need to go out there every time and pitch seven , eight innings because you might like it , he said i might like it , but i also realize that the innings and the pitches that are going to be mostly counted on from me are going to be late in the year so as much as i want to get my arm where it needs to be that s what spring training is for there s a time and a place to go out there and throw innings and pitches that time , it seemed clear , was not in the second week of april against a team as bad as the royals yesterday marked the 14th straight royals loss at yankee stadium , the longest losing streak for an opponent in the bronx since the cleveland indians lost 22 in a row from 1960 to 1962 it probably did not hearten kansas city fans when george steinbrenner , the yankees' principal owner , paid their team a backhanded compliment as he left the ballpark they 're a good team , steinbrenner said they are not going to lose 100 games the royals walked 17 yankees in the first two games of this series , and pitching to them yesterday was not a much better strategy the yankees walked only three times , but hit three home runs gary sheffield , jason giambi and johnny damon damon connected off jimmy gobble with two on in the eighth inning earlier in the atbat , he had accidentally flung his bat into the stands behind the home dugout he did not ask the fan to return it i figured , if i threw it up in the stands , it deserved to stay there , damon said it was damon s first home run as a yankee , and it reached the third deck in right field that was the spot where his last yankee stadium homer had landed , for the boston red sox in game 7 of the 2004 american league championship series yesterday s homer put the game well out of reach , and helped the yankees extend their own major league record until this season , according to the elias sports bureau , no team had ever scored at least nine runs in its first four victories of a season the yankees have scored that many in all five games they have won we know we ca n't rely on scoring all those runs , derek jeter said we know it s great to have some guys that are swinging the bats well , and we 're going to score but it s not going to happen all season that may be true , but for now , the yankees will take it they left for minnesota with a fourgame winning streak , a lineup of bruisers and an ace starting pitcher who just might be as healthy as they say inside pitch kelly stinnett caught randy johnson for the second start in a row , and manager joe torre said he would stick with that arrangement for a while it s not an issue , said jorge posada , the regular catcher torre noted that johnson won with posada on opening night , but said it would be easier to schedule posada s off days if stinnett catches johnson every time for the first time in his 19year career , johnson has not allowed a walk in his first three starts tanyon sturtze was booed loudly after giving up a leadoff homer in the eighth yesterday , just as he did in the seventh inning tuesday i did n't even hear the fans , sturtze said they can do whatever they want after the homer , torre jogged from the dugout to reassure sturtze , who has an 810 era i have a lot of confidence in him , torre said photos randy johnson , talking with catcher kelly stinnett in the fourth inning , left the game after five innings , having thrown 87 pitches \( photo by g paul burnett the new york times \) \( pg d1 \) johnny damon gave the yankees a 92 lead in the eighth inning with a threerun

a severe tornado took central westchester county by surprise on wednesday afternoon , appearing suddenly over the hudson river and carving a narrow path of destruction through sleepy hollow and the hamlet of hawthorne in mount pleasant the tornado emerged over the river shortly before 4 pm and quickly moved east , snapping and sheering trees along the way , knocking down power lines , destroying businesses , and tossing at least two cars into the air it crossed directly over route 9a and the saw mill river parkway , and both were temporarily shut down four people were taken to hospitals with injuries , but none were hurt seriously county officials said it was amazing that more people were not injured the police initially received reports that many people were either missing or trapped in buildings that had partially collapsed , but those reports turned out to be false , said andrew j spano , the county executive i think we were extremely lucky , he said all along highways and roads in the towns that were hit , hundreds of downed trees created hurdles , and countless power lines lay on the ground , in some cases in flames county officials said their priority was to clear away that debris and try to protect the dozens of businesses that had been damaged , including california closets on route 9a in hawthorne , which had two exterior walls ripped off some of these buildings are just wide open , said louis alagno , the chief of police of mount pleasant the tornado stunned people in westchester not only because of its ferocity but also because of its rarity the last serious tornado to hit the hudson valley was in 1989 , but that was in orange county , on the other side of the river some county officials said they were so surprised on wednesday that at first they thought the tornado reports were a joke this is an anomaly , at least to us , mr spano said i 've lived in westchester all my life , and i have never seen a tornado man is convicted in mall murder one year after concetta russocarriero , a legal secretary and mother of two , was found stabbed to death near the galleria mall in downtown white plains , a homeless sex offender was found guilty of her murder the man , phillip grant , 44 , who told police he stabbed ms russocarriero on june 29 , 2005 , because he wanted to kill a white person , was convicted tuesday of murder as a hate crime and criminal possession of a weapon the 12 jurors took less than four hours to reach a verdict , after a monthlong trial in the westchester county courthouse in white plains this is a victory for all of us , said michael russo , 24 , the younger of the victim s two sons mr grant , who is black , was the first person convicted of murder as a hate crime in westchester county on the morning of the murder , he later told police , he was paranoid that a group of white men were plotting to harm him , so he hid in a garage stairwell with a knife and waited for hours until a white person walked by ms russocarriero , 56 , was stabbed twice in the chest as she walked to her car about 1 pm , and mr grant was arrested minutes later about a block away throughout the trial , lawyers for the defense argued that mr grant was delusional and suggested that the authorities had pressured him into making a false confession when the verdict was read , mr grant stared calmly at the jury before he was handcuffed and led away he faces 20 years to life in prison when he is sentenced on sept 11 but according to legal experts , mr grant will probably never be released if the state legislature passes a measure designed to keep violent sex offenders confined in institutions even after they are released from prison a bill to create the measure passed in the state senate and is being considered in the assembly it is known as connie s law , in honor of ms russocarriero owners vacate xrated shop in nyack many residents of nyack were celebrating last week after their nearly sixmonth struggle to force an xrated video shop out of the village came to an end a notice was put up in the store last week indicating that the space would soon be vacant most village residents took that as a sign that the owners had decided to leave nyack , a small , artsy town that sits along the eastern edge of rockland county the store , fama dvd and video , has fueled a firestorm in the village ever since the nyack planning board voted in january to approve it the store is on route 59 , just around the corner from a hospital , a middle school and several bus stops the area is zoned for adult businesses worried about the type of people the shop would attract , hundreds of residents attended town hall meetings to complain and lash out at officials catholic citizenship , a civic group , filed a lawsuit against the planning board and the actor stephen baldwin , a resident of nearby grandview , photographed people as they entered the store one morning and threatened to publish their pictures in newspapers in april , a justice of the new york state supreme court ordered the store to close until the village conducted a proper study of the socioeconomic impact it would have on the neighborhood the owners of the shop were required to file another application with the planning board if they wished to reopen , but they never did , said kathy harahan , a senior clerk with the village neither quintus algama nor leslie fernandopulle , the owners , responded to telephone calls seeking comment but walter r sevastian , the village lawyer , said their intent was clear they have left , he said photos blown down walls were damaged at california closets in hawthorne \( photo by alan zale for the new york times \) phillip grant

east to hold off redskins , manning and giants must improve this may be the nfl s deepest division , with any team capable of making the playoffs the washington redskins have the veteran talent to unseat the giants as the division champions acquiring antwaan randle el and brandon lloyd will strengthen a washington receiving corps that features the electric santana moss and the dependable tight end chris cooley assuming clinton portis recovers from a preseason shoulder injury , the running game should be potent the redskins traded for t j duckett as insurance in case portis has problems recovering the defense is solid , anchored by linebacker marcus washington and safeties sean taylor and adam archuleta teams coached by joe gibbs almost always finish strong , and the redskins should manage at least 10 victories , enough to return to the playoffs the giants have super bowl aspirations , but that may be a stretch the offense has superb talent , with tiki barber at running back , plaxico burress at wide receiver and jeremy shockey at tight end but it will be difficult for the giants to repeat as the division champions unless quarterback eli manning raises his game look for more teams to key on barber , daring manning to beat them the carolina panthers did that during the playoffs last season and defeated the giants , 230 defensively , the giants addressed their needs during free agency , acquiring linebacker lavar arrington and defensive backs sam madison and will demps arrington was once one of the league s most feared linebackers , especially when he rushed the passer the giants hope arrington will boost an already formidable pass rush , led by defensive ends michael strahan and osi umenyiora if they perform as expected , the giants could create nightmares for opposing quarterbacks but sooner or later , barber and strahan will slow down , and if manning remains inconsistent , the giants may have another short run in the playoffs , if they get there at all by the middle of last season , the philadelphia eagles were a disabled , dysfunctional team their quarterback , donovan mcnabb , was lost to a hernia injury terrell owens was off the team after feuding with mcnabb and alienating the coaching staff and the front office by the end of the season , the eagles were 610 , their worst record since 1999 the eagles are unlikely to reach miami in february , but they look poised for a bounceback season mcnabb is healthy , free of t o and eager to prove he is one of the game s top quarterbacks without owens s bigplay ability , philadelphia will revert to its dumpandrun offense with mcnabb throwing highpercentage passes to running back brian westbrook , tight end l j smith and wide receiver donte' stallworth defense is where the eagles should improve significantly the acquisition of defensive end darren howard will aid the pass rush , which is anchored by defensive end jevon kearse more pressure on the quarterback should help philadelphia s veteran secondary of safeties brian dawkins and michael lewis , and cornerbacks lito sheppard and sheldon brown look for the eagles to win at least eight games , and , with a little luck , challenge for the division title jerry jones , the owner of the dallas cowboys , gambled by signing owens even if owens behaves and contributes , the cowboys have a suspect offensive line and an inconsistent running attack bill parcells is a great coach , but the cowboys have not won a playoff game during his three seasons in dallas in a weaker division , the cowboys would fare better but in this division , they could finish in last place west postsuper bowl stumbles will end with the seahawks the seattle seahawks are well aware that the past five super bowl losers have missed the playoffs the next season but seattle has the talent to avoid the postsuper bowl blues matt hasselbeck is not a glamour quarterback , but he is a winner he does not overwhelm opponents with arm strength , but he almost always throws accurately he is also a master at buying time in the pocket coach mike holmgren has developed hasselbeck into a franchise quarterback , as he did with brett favre in green bay shaun alexander was the nfl s best running back last season , scoring a record 28 touchdowns and rushing for 1 , 880 yards , and the seahawks rewarded him with a lucrative contract some expect alexander to lose his edge with a bigger bank account , but losing to pittsburgh in the super bowl gives alexander and his teammates motivation the defense should be as solid as last season s seattle has two talented young linebackers , lofa tatupu and leroy hill both were superb as rookies , and they ignite a defense that is aggressive and smart the seahawks have one of the league s biggest homefield advantages they play in a loud stadium , and they often face teams that have traveled through several times zones with its talent and experience , seattle is poised to make another super bowl run the arizona cardinals have reason for optimism , with a new stadium their new running back , edgerrin james and their splendid wide receivers , anquan boldin and larry fitzgerald but the cardinals still have holes , particularly on the offensive line
to catch up , read the live playbyplay here that s the game a smashing contest , with both sides playing attacking , if sometimes sloppy , football the scoreline was unfair on japan , who were equals to australia for much of the match as for the technical difficulties here , i can only hope they were caused by millions of people around the world simultaneously trying to access the ramblings on soccer of a man in his pajamas in brooklyn heights watching spanish tv i ll be back tomorrow for franceswitzerland , and come back in an hour for jeff z klein with the united states s opener 91 goooooooooooool ! australia 3 japan 1 now that was hard on the japanese left short at the back , they couldn t deal with aloisi , who dribbled past komano , his one marker , and easily converted his oneonnone 89 goooooooooool ! australia 2 japan 1 what a comeback for australia ! it s cahill again he gets the ball just inside the area , gets a moment to set up , and shoots the ball hits the left post , then caroms to the right post before settling in the net it s a game of inches 87 both sides are playing for a winning goal just three minutes left , but they might get one 84 goooooooooooooool ! japan 1 australia 1 off a neill throwin , the ball caroms around off several players on both sides then finds it way to the feet of substitute cahill , who sends it in once again , good substitution 83 another good free kick chance for australia , and chipperfield finds a way around the wall , but is saved 80 japan is starting to get some counteattacking opportunities now , but their crosses haven t been on target and so they haven t been turning them into many good shots 77 here s the pattern of the game you mostly haven t been reading about narazaki boots a long ball , australia works it forward , harried quite effectively by the japanese midfield they manage to get it near the area , only to be frustrated b y a bad pass or good defensive play 75 sub australia aloisi for wilkshire another striker on as the aussies go for broke 69 a dangerous free kick to the australians , dead center just outside the area viduka blasts it in past the wall , but kawaguchi is right where he needs to be 64 i d say the man of the match award so far is between nakamura and error establishing a database connection 62 sub kennedy for moore that s a forward for a defender as australia look for an equalizer 60 a good spell of possession earns japan a corner , which is cleared 57 chipchipchipperfield puts in a decent cross from the left , but viduka s header pops directly up in the air just after , moore earns a yellow 56 right back tsuboi of japan is down with an injury a genuine one substitution japan will bring on moniwa to replace him 54 substitution tim cahill , top scorer for everton in the premier league this season on for the inaccurate bresciano good move it s followed by a speculative shot by emerton that s well wide 53 a good run down the left from komano followed by a shot from nakata that doesn t have enough on it 49 so far japan is in a more defensive shape this half perhaps there were some words of caution from zico at halftime the second half begins a bit about goalscorer nakamura he plays for celtic after a spell with italian minnows reggina and was player of the tournament at the asian cup in 2004 technical update we ve actually got a nytimescomwide problem , which a full team of crack support staff is now working on apologies for any past \( or future \) slowdowns halftime a great first half here as both teams attack relentlessly only some poor finishing has kept us from a three or fourgoal half and we are still welcoming your emails at the \( apparently functioning \) worldcup nytimescom minutes 2740 recap japan scores , 30 seconds later kewell sends one just over , i notice something s wrong and make some frantic phone calls , both sides continue their endtoend action , miyamoto gets a yellow , grella gets a yellow , australia gets a few more chances , including another miss by marco bresciano who is missing an awful lot , the site comes back up 40 as you may have noticed , the entire blog crashed for 10 minutes there right after the japan goal perhaps it was caused by all your f5 s anyway , a quick phone call to the tech guys and we re back in business 26 goooooooooool ! japan 1 australia 0 shunsuke nakamura lobs one in from just outside the box two japanese forwards and two australian defenders leap for it , keeper schwarzer flaps at it ineffectively and it sails over all of them and into the net ! 25 viduka gets the ball with his back to goal and executes a cheeky back heel to an onrushing bresciano , whose shot is stopped by a diving kawaguchi almost one for the highlight reels 22 best chance in a while for japan star winger alex creates it with a run into the center he finds takahara in a good position just outside the box , but he sends the shot wide 21 australia has a nice sustained possession , but it ends with harry kewell falling down , perhaps nudged by komano 18 much like bastien schweinsteiger of germany , australia s left back scott chipperfield has been adopted as a favorite by the univision announcers , who refer to him variously as chip \( pause \) erfield , chip , and chipperchipperchipper 14 another sequence of chances for australia ends with bresciano sending a shot over good action so far at both ends 13 fukunishi takes the first of this year s cup s signature shots the bomb from distance it goes over 11 nice work on the right by yanagisawa earns a corner for japan , but it s cleared 9 takahara s rooster cut gets the early prize for hairstyle , but you have to admire nakazawa s floppy mop too 6 two great chances for viduka ! he s released on the left by a nice header from bresciano keeper kawaguchi can t get a handle on his first shot but manages to block the rebound viduka maybe should have scored , at least on the second chance japan deals with the subsequent corner 4 wilkshire clatters into japan s brazilianborn winger alex are the roughandready australians sending a message early \? referee essam abdel fatah rushes over to urge calm kickoff we re under way and japan earns an early free kick it s off the aussie wall pregame thoughts g day and welcome to the new york times playbyplay coverage of the world cup i m victor mather here to call australiajapan , which is about to kick off in kaiserslautern hit f5 or refresh to get the updates and feel free to email your thoughts to worldcup nytimescom the australians are in the cup for the first time since 1974 , when they lost all three matches without scoring a goal but this year s team is considerably stronger and rates a slight favorite today with the bookies most of the australians are good enough to play in top leagues in europe , and the team even plays most of its friendly matches in europe , rather than making its players fly all the way back down under japan advanced to the final 16 last time with home field advantage , but they may find the going harder this year only seven of the team play outside of japan nevertheless , the team s coach , zico , that wonderful brazilian player from the 70 s and 80 s , has his team playing with spontaneity that can be fun to watch this is likely to be the last ever world cup meeting between these teams at the group stage australia qualified for the cup as the representative of oceania , but beginning next time they will be part of asia , and asian teams can t be drawn into the same group under the current rules there has been a bit of bad blood in the buildup to the match the head of japan s football association said that australia is guilty of a lot of dirty fouls australia coach guus hiddink fired back , saying i m getting very angry when people suggest that we have a good team they like to fight every team must fight in my opinion , the bbc reported the book on both these teams is that they may be somewhat weak at the back so let s hope for a goalfest !

for all the hype about the 1960s being a time when politics and music merged into a great shining sword that thwarted racism and ended war , few of the era s protest songs have retained significant power outside of their initial context yet fortunate son has lost none of the ferocity with which it was initially written and recorded sure , it s great to hold hands and sing we shall overcome together , but angry times call for angry songs , spelled out in blunt language and bold colors i t s enough of a middle finger to be rightly labeled as punk s cool uncle the very fact of its continued political relevance only makes it sound even more livid , foaming at the mouth over how little has changed these last 40 years
after growing mushrooms in the town of franklin for more than 25 years , franklin farms has announced that it will move most of its operations to pennsylvania in june and lay off most of the company s approximately 380 employees the company said it reached an agreement with the giorgio fresh company in reading , pa , on march 31 to grow and package its mushrooms the company said it would continue to produce organic mushrooms at franklin farms wilhelm meya , the owner of the company , said he was moving most of the business because of the high costs of transportation and energy this is not a major agricultural area , he said , referring to connecticut we have to import the materials that we use to grow the mushrooms a long distance and the high cost of diesel fuel has made that expensive also , my energy costs have doubled in two years from 2 million to 4 million mr meya said most of franklin farm s employees would be laid off in early june he said they had been offered jobs in pennsylvania , but none accepted he said a few would remain to run the organic operations , but he did n't know how many following a meeting with mr meya on monday , gov m jodi rell said in a statement that she was upset that the company did not consult with the state before deciding to move corporations are obviously free to make their own business decisions , she said however , i am extremely disappointed that franklin farms did not contact the state at the start of the negotiations to see how we may have assisted in keeping the business and jobs in eastern connecticut even if energy costs were given as part of the reason , this was a done deal before anyone could intervene james watson , a spokesman for the state department economic and community development , said the state could have offered franklin farms lowinterest loans and grants to modernize its equipment but mr meya said it would not have made a difference our system is very energydependent , he said we sometimes burn 30 , 000 gallons of oil in a week , and the state cannot control how much a barrel of oil costs he said the equipment used at giorgio fresh was more energy efficient richard matters , the first selectman of franklin , said the town would lose about 90 , 000 a year in taxes because of the move he said it would also affect other businesses naturally , the workers at the farm spend money at the convenience stores and the gas stations , mr matters said it s going to have a trickledown effect franklin would offer tax credits to a company willing to locate there , mr matters said mr meya said he would work with local and state officials to find a business that could move into the part of the farm left unoccupied he said deciding to move was a difficult choice the hardest thing is what this means for the employees who have worked with me , and were so dedicated , and built the franklin name up , he said it s not a pleasant ending for anyone who worked there the state department of labor was expected to send a team to franklin to help the workers find new jobs and offer job training photos franklin farms has announced that it will move most of its operations to pennsylvania in june , though its organic mushrooms will still be produced in franklin \( photographs by thomas mcdonald for the new york times \)

at 8 30 on a recent morning in west windsor , nj , ken anderson was sitting behind the wheel of his car , waiting patiently for a train to pull into the princeton junction station from new york he was not picking anyone up in what has become part of his daily hourlong commute into manhattan , mr anderson was staking out reverse commuters so he could grab a parking spot there s usually one or two people who get off the train and into their cars , and when one of their spots opens up , i make my move , said mr anderson , 34 , of hightstown , nj , who works as an accounts payable supervisor at atari to have any chance for a parking spot , you have to get here before 6 30 in the morning or after 8 for me , parking every day is an adventure earlier that morning , kristan flynn , a 34yearold research associate who lives in princeton , five miles from the station , sped into the parking lot on her bicycle no place to park , she said even the bike racks are nearly all full more than 7 , 000 people board commuter trains each day at the princeton junction station , but there are only enough parking spaces for about half of them , according to new jersey transit for mr anderson and the 3 , 767 other commuters who have applied for a permit through the west windsor parking authority , the wait can be as long as seven years , officials said another 2 , 833 from west windsor are on a twoyear waiting list for parking lots reserved for township residents commuters do n't have many alternatives at nearby stations thirteen miles to the south , the daily lot at the hamilton train station is filled by 6 30 am , and there are no available permits a few miles south , in trenton , the parking garage operator says the 90amonth specials are all taken , leaving commuters the option of paying 8 a day or 135 a month at a time when gov jon s corzine is pushing for the construction of another commuter rail tunnel under the hudson river , at a cost of 72 billion , transit and local officials have yet to address a longstanding problem even now there are not enough parking spaces and the problem is not unique to new jersey parking is a scarce commodity at many rail stations along the tracks operated by metronorth in westchester county and connecticut and by the long island rail road in nassau and suffolk counties in westchester , there are about 26 , 000 parking spaces for 75 , 000 commuters on long island , almost half of the parking lots are more than 95 percent full if we 're growing the commuter rail system , we have to grapple with how we are going to get people to the trains , said jon orcutt , the executive director of the tristate transportation campaign in new york , a mass transit advocacy group it s a major planning issue with towns across the metropolitan area yet , commuters without parking permits find themselves caught between municipalities reluctant to build parking garages and state transit agencies , like new jersey transit and new york s metropolitan transportation authority , which operates metronorth and the long island rail road , that have failed to keep up with the growing demand the names of many commuters still dreaming of a permit to call their own are on waiting lists longer than their vehicles in the meantime , people find themselves paying hefty fees at private lots and , at princeton junction , even offering nearby homeowners 100 a month to use their driveways gone are what transportation officials call the kiss and ride days , when wives dropped husbands off at the station and picked them up at night for many families , the parking crunch has created a hardship , particularly for those working parents who ca n't drop their children off at day care centers before 7 am or who would like to put their child on the school bus come september , but ca n't afford to wave goodbye because parking spots vanish just after dawn those who live too far to walk to train and bus stations have come up with assorted strategies , including getting there by bicycle , inline skating , even skateboards in new jersey and across the region , municipalities own and operate most of the parking lots at train stations this means that residents usually get parking permits before nonresidents it also means that municipalities can restrict the expansion of parking lots and throw up obstacles to proposed parking garages , often out of concern that additional spaces would attract more commuters from outside the community , leading to more traffic adding a big monolithic structure like a parking garage makes people from small towns feel like the bigcity boogeyman is coming , said darius sollohub , a professor at the new jersey institute of technology who heads the infrastructure planning program at the college s school of architecture it makes them feel that they have become too urban , that they are a city now and no longer a town , mr sollohub said it goes against the reasons for why they moved to a small town in the first place

for women who want a drug to ease menopausal hot flashes but do not want to take hormones , certain antidepressants and other medicines may help , researchers are reporting but those medicines have side effects , little is known about whether it is safe to take them for a long time and they do not work as well as hormones given the drawbacks , the nonhormonal drugs are not optimal choices for most women , according to an article being published today in the journal of the american medical association that conclusion would seem to leave no optimal choice for most women , a vexing predicament for those who have been searching for a safe alternative to estrogen , and who are tired of being told to sip ice water , dress in layers and turn up the air conditioning researchers estimate that 50 percent of women have hot flashes during menopause and that 20 percent of those affected seek treatment the flashes a sudden sensation of being overheated , with sweating and facial flushing can occur repeatedly , day and night they can disrupt sleep and persist for years , sometimes even decades hormones , once popular , fell from grace in 2002 when a large government study found they increased the risk of blood clots , strokes , heart attacks and breast cancer before that , doctors had freely recommended hormones , knowing they would ease menopause symptoms and believing they would also help prevent heart disease and other chronic ailments the 2002 study shattered those beliefs sales plummeted as the number of users dropped to 57 million in 2003 from 91 million in 2001 dr jeffrey tice , an internist at the university of california , san francisco , who wrote an editorial accompanying the study , said with hormones , we really were thinking we were preventing a lot of diseases and it was good for the long term maybe we were brainwashed by the industry paying people to tell us that in medical school now , other drugs have come into use for hot flashes , but not much is known about their effectiveness or longterm safety until recently , there was little interest in studying them rigorously , because hormones worked so well for most women there s a lot of hype around trying things that we have n't proven effective and , sadly , we have n't proven they 're safe , said dr heidi d nelson , the first author of the journal article and an internist and professor at the oregon health and science university the report is based on a review of 43 studies of various nonhormonal drugs being used for hot flashes most were originally approved for other purposes the drugs include the antidepressants paxil \( paroxetine \) , effexor \( venlafaxine \) , prozac \( fluoxetine \) and celexa \( citalopram \) , the blood pressure drug catapres \( clonidine \) , and the seizure drug neurontin \( gabapentin \) some came into use for menopause because women taking them for other reasons told doctors the drugs seemed to diminish their hot flashes the researchers also examined studies of nonprescription extracts from soy and red clover , which contain plant estrogens called isoflavones and are marketed as a natural treatment for hot flashes none of the drugs or extracts are approved by the food and drug administration to treat hot flashes only hormones are approved for that purpose but doctors are free to prescribe medicines for any use they see fit , and many recommend the drugs or plant products for hot flashes , based on study findings and their patients' experiences the researchers found that on average , antidepressants and catapres each appeared to reduce hot flashes by about one per day , and neurontin by about two per day for women with a lot of hot flashes , that is not a very impressive performance , dr nelson said , but she added that the drugs may also lessen their severity estrogen , by comparison , gets rid of two to three flashes a day , and also makes them milder , dr nelson said though hormones cause small increases in the risks for breast cancer and heart disease , a short course may still be the best choice for women with very severe symptoms , she said , though she added that women who have had breast cancer should definitely not take hormones all the nonhormonal drugs have side effects the antidepressants can cause headache , nausea , dry mouth , dizziness and insomnia or sleepiness catapres can cause some of the same symptoms and also constipation neurontin causes sleepiness , and soy extracts can produce gastrointestinal troubles among the antidepressants , paxil seemed to have the strongest evidence of benefit there were only two studies for effexor , just one of which suggested it might help for the other antidepressants , prozac and celexa , and for the plant extracts , there was no statistically significant evidence that they worked for hot flashes but i would n't want any drug company to get an edge , dr nelson said it s just where we are today it s not the end of the story she took a cautious view because she and her colleagues found that there was relatively little reliable data on using the drugs for hot flashes of 10 studies on antidepressants , for instance , the researchers judged only two of the studies to be good , and the rest fair or poor the poor rating often meant a study , even though well conducted , was too small or too short to be conclusive if there were only 20 women in the study , how do we say it s appropriate for all the women in the country \? dr nelson said now we know what we need , she said more bigger studies on more things in the meantime , both dr tice and dr nelson said that for women who find their symptoms intolerable and want treatment , they would favor antidepressants over hormones but dr tice warned that the drugs should not be used long term i would n't encourage the mindset of putting women on these drugs thinking they 're going to be on them for life , he said , adding that patients should try the drugs for a few months and then try to stop we hate to medicalize a natural process , dr nelson said , but she added that severe symptoms should not be dismissed we want to take it seriously , but not everybody needs to be on prescription drugs for it

darryl strawberry , one of the mets stars of the 1986 world series champions , threw out the ceremonial first pitch thursday night in game 1 of the national league championship series against st louis at shea stadium mookie wilson , another hero of that series , is scheduled to do the same thing before game 2 on friday night strawberry stood well in front of the mound to get the ball to the plate on the fly in a news conference the previous day , strawberry was asked how much he misses playing and what parts of the game he missed most none , strawberry said there comes a point in time when it s over it s over but strawberry also said he fondly remembered that we were the most hated team in the national league everywhere we went and that the mets were kind of proud of that back then , when they had a reputation for rambunctious behavior when someone suggested to strawberry that the mets had taken the city s attention away from the yankees who were eliminated by detroit in the first round strawberry disagreed well , i don t want to stretch it that far just yet , said strawberry , who also played with the yankees the mets are definitely in the position to win new york city back in that wilson s son , preston , was the starting left fielder for st louis , strawberry recalled young wilson as a boy around his dad in the mets clubhouse you used to always see preston running around , strawberry said you kind of looked and you knew this guy would some day be a ballplayer he was a good kid i know , for him , coming here probably means more to him than a lot of the other cardinal players coming here , because he walked up and down these halls for a long time
the controversy over the plot twist in the new season of survivor on cbs , dividing the competing teams along racial lines , took its toll on the show s appeal to advertisers , judging by the commercial lineup in the premiere episode on thursday before the episode ran , many major national marketers that had bought commercial time during previous seasons of survivor said they would not return the list included campbell soup , cocacola , general motors , home depot , johnson johnson , procter gamble and united parcel service none of them attributed their withdrawals to the racebased format and friday , after the episode ran , j c penney said in an email message that its current fall fashion campaign would not appear during survivor the episode on thursday had no sponsors in important categories like automobiles , financial services or soft drinks one wellrepresented category was movie studios they often have fewer qualms about program content than mainstream marketers the studios included columbia , mgm , touchstone \( walt disney \) and warner brothers the single largest sponsor seemed to be reckitt benckiser , which ran spots for the cleaning products easyoff , electrasol and lysol mars ran the same commercial for pedigree dog food twice there was also a spot for the burlington coat factory warehouse corporation , known for buying spots in shows that other advertisers shun wellknown brands advertising in the episode included cingular cellphones , colgate toothpaste , energizer batteries , gap and victoria s secret , radio shack and taco bell there were at least a dozen promotions for cbs shows , but it was hard to determine if that was more than usual with the new fall season starting this week

readers respond to thomas friedman s may 5 column ,  eli fisk , los angeles if only the ill effects of 70 per barrel oil on were confined to the petroist states you mentioned politics in the us also seem to be less transparent , less sensitive to opposition voices , less open to a broad set of interactions with the outside world and less focused on building the legal and educational structures for longterm growth and competiveness in a flat world matt stillerman , ithaca , ny your first law of petropolitics appears to be at work in the us we certainly have experienced the whole suite of symptoms , and the root cause is , plausibly , the desire for assured supplies of oil consider your litany of woe 1 free speech and a free press subpoenas for reporters , and now the threat of prosecution for espionage ! the right of people especially government employees to speak out has been seriously curtailed through fear and coercion 2 fee elections florida , november 2000 case closed ! ! ! 3 freedom to assemble new york during the republican national convention 4 government transparency way too many examples 5 an independent judiciary the supreme court selected bush and thus can hardly be considered independent scalia s failure to recuse himself in the case against cheney is just perfect 6 the rule of law 750 signing statements , in which bush asserts his intention to disregard the law he has just signed lack of habeas corpus in guantanamo extraordinary rendition 7 the freedom to form independent political parties and nongovernmental organizations you can form these organizations , but you will be spied on ! our nation should focus on promoting freedom and democracy right here it appears to be eroding fast peter graven , portland , ore the price of oil should now be a daily preoccupation of the secretary of state , not just of the secretary of energy this phrase seems a bit ironic considering what troubles we ourselves get into in securing our oil supply and therefore its price i think you make a great connection regarding the power these countries receive from the money they earn from energy sales which leads to a question does being an environmentalist mean hoping to increase the cost of energy as a means of discouraging its use and to include its externalities , or does it mean decreasing demand and therefore having the price of energy decrease which strips power from these countries \? interesting conundrum richard e fertel , west caldwell , nj the days of cheap oil are over forever the petroist nations will continually test the upward price they think we are willing to pay for oil there is a point beyond which , the alternate energy technologies become economical and fall into place these nations know this and will keep the price of oil just below this point and keep us addicted forever if they can we must bite the bullet and develop alternate energy sources right away america , europe and developing countries must not have to kowtow to tinhorn dictators dripping with slimy fossil fuels american sons and daughters should no longer be put at risk to subsidize cheap suv gas let s make the switch to alternate energy now let s use our technological muscle to render petroist oil as worthless as petroist sand dwight thurston , canton , conn you lump chavez of venezuela in with actual bad regimes such as sudan s and nigeria s please make a list of the transgressions of sudan , nigeria and venezuela compare them the worst chavez has done is offend the united states government , as distinct from its people , and the transnational corporate interests that benefit from the recent version of globalization what s bad about wanting your own country s resources for your own country , or about not liking the neoliberal trade policies that ruin your country , or about being tired of having the us government , the world bank , the imf , the cia , and transnational corporations essentially dictate the politics and economics of your country \? you d be cranky too dan deluca , new york i think the correspondence between shrinking democratization and the price of oil is just a manifestation of the resource curse democracy is fragile it requires really strong institutions , both governmental and nongovernmental in particular , a strong , watchdog press all those petrodollars around dramatically increase the incentive for corruption , which naturally weakens the institutions and none of these petroist countries of which you speak had strong and noncorrupt institutions to begin with interestingly , mexico is a big oil producer , but its democracy appears to be stronger than ever is it just that their institutions have finally matured \?
the bagger was reading comments and trying to decide which is more annoying someone who makes a living blogging through a thirdperson persona , or otherwise smart , insightful rugrats \( the bagger s term last year for those underemployed folks who read and respond to him \) who resort to the affectation of one would in their comments one would hope such people would go back to grad school the bagger is a bit owly this morning because yesterday he filed items from a cab , a starbucks and a park bench doing real work , as opposed to sitting in his basement stroking his nonexistent beard , fatigues him and causes a loss of perspective the bagger has assisted in the manufacture of both jelly beans and hydraulic tube assemblies to earn a living typing , no matter where it occurs , is a good gig and being an oscar ninny has its benefits but going with the rapaciously dark mood today touch of crabbiness for a moment , he would like to say that all those other ninnies who responded to the golden globe nominations by tilting their heads upward and screaming the sky is falling ! are missing the point a few facts to consider journalists are always subject to pressures , threats and blandishments , and no group is worked over more thoroughly than the hollywood foreign press association \( for a nice tour under the hood of the awards , click sharon waxman s globe story in the times \) the nominations are the end of a long campaign that involved stars pretending to be interested in critics , some of whom file or don t reviews that are read by a small number of people in faraway lands in that sense , the globes are less a measure of excellence than campaign efficacy is it just a coincidence that the five winners in the dramatic category had the same press person the amazingly effective nadia bronson working on their behalf \? it is not that the fix is in , but certain tendencies are at work it is important to remember that in spite of its growing stature , the hfpa is first and foremost , casting a television show that s why you end up with a result that suggests , laughably , that leonardo dicaprio s work in the departed and blood diamond is equally deserving of a best actor nomination or that clint eastwood deserved to be nominated for both flags and letters \( as anne thompson pointed out , don t look for a repeat performance at the oscars \) and its why beyonc knowles gets tagged as the leading actor in dreamgirls , while jennifer hudson , who owns the show in more ways than one , is cited in the supporting category then , too , hfpa is often so busy facelicking those they hold dear that the movies are just trailers for their appearance of the lickees at the globes that is how a slight , earnest movie like bobby ends up being cited as one of the five best films of the year there were also results to love yesterday the ascension of babel , a serious , ambitious movie , is exciting true , some reviewers saw it as a delicate ensemble piece and others saw as a kit in need of assembly but it was good to see its ambitions and achievements noted , even if it needed the allure of brad pitt at the microphone to get there the selection of maggie gyllenhaal in the best actress category was also terrific the bagger has not seen sherrybaby something he is going to fix soon but which young actress has done more recently that ms gyllenhaal \? go to the tape stranger than fiction , happy endings , world trade center , the great new wonderful she has range , allure and chops and what about mark wahlberg , who made the cut in supporting for the departed \? you could say his turn was a parlor trick of foulmouthed surliness , but few roles this year have stamped themselves so indelibly on the bagger s memory as mr wahlberg s nastybuttrue cop which brings us to our last churlish thought people have been rightly amazed that bill condon , director of dreamgirls , did not merit a hug from the globes some people have bounced off that and suggested that dreamgirls , a luscious parade float seemingly designed to win the hearts of the academy , has faltered not so last night , an experienced oscar hand attended an academy screening of the film in new york he she it said that they had never seen such a wildly enthusiastic reception for a film in all of their days the bagger is telling you that dreamgirls was and is the belle of this year s ball and it is up to some of it s armed and dangerous opponents the departed , letters from iwo jima , the queen to knock the girls off the podium none of that changed yesterday
the following quotes were obtained in followup interviews after the poll was completed on the mark foley scandal barbara vochatzer , covina , calif i think they handled it improperly in that it s a go nowhere situation they should have just addressed the issue , said this is what he s done , he s a pervert , get him out of there but it needs to be more firmly approached and be done with it instead of this dragging it out in the press i m so sick of this , i can hardly bear it it s being dragged out for political reasons i believe the dnc will do anything they can to get people either not to vote or to vote against george bush get over it , george bush isn t running they know plenty about plenty of congressmen this is just the tip of the iceberg but the facts are , as i m reading , the people that he actually approached and got involved with , ultimately , were over the age of consent , so it s a moot point i m sick of hearing about it it s all done for political reasons and i hope this backfires in the face of the democratic party it s repulsive i didn t want to hear about clinton and monica and i don t want to hear about this i m not interested at all and it s certainly not going to turn me away from voting republican never judith hanson , leonard , tex i stand by my thought that it was badly handled i can t go into it to the depths that someone who is really into politics could , but from what i gather , as far back as 2001 , there was a problem and this problem was not unknown to the leadership but they chose , presumably for political reasons , for expediency , to hope it would go away and just keep their heads in the sand about it considering the position that foley held , and the potential seriousness , it needed to be addressed and it was not i think the total reason for that was political expediency and that offends me greatly they knew it would have harmed them in the public eye if it became public knowledge , and now it has it has cost them political ground that s inevitable because there are so many people out there that will seize on it there are the staunch republicans who will stick with the party no matter what they do but others will be swayed the leadership of this country at the higher levels , for the most part , seems to be predicated on political expediency i can t support that with facts and figures , but that s my feeling the situation should have been addressed , and it could have been addressed quietly , earlier on he could have been pressured without bringing it out in full view i think a couple of years ago they could have stopped it this hurts the country because we need to have confidence in our leadership we don t have the room to spare to waste it on things like that bill schultz , florence , sc democrat or republican , anyone that handles stuff like that tries to cover up for each other it makes no difference who is in power , democrats or republicans , they all do the same thing i know it happens there s a lot of stuff like that that s not out in the public you don t hear about it because most of the media protects the democrats they do not put all that garbage out there on them like they do on anybody that s conservative foley is just a sorry person this is coming out now because of the election every one of them knew about it but none of them wanted to say anything , republicans or democrats and the republicans should have said something and then they wouldn t have had this blowing up in their faces now richard steinbronn , andrews , nc i think the information of foley s misconduct was available long before this incident developed in the papers and had been communicated to the appropriate leadership the leadership simply failed to take action it wouldn t matter how they dealt with it so long as they dealt with it to the best of my knowledge they haven t dealt with it and they ve been running a campaign of denying it obviously you don t want to scandalize your own party of you can avoid it rosemarie cavacchioli , deer park , ny it was improperly handled that s putting it nicely but it hasn t changed how i feel i have faith in the republican party they re doing the right thing and if they did screw up they ll fix it renita seymore , hanover , pa i think they knew about it before and they covered it up because they thought it wouldn t come out to the public they were hoping no one would find out about it , ever i think it should have been dealt with as soon as they realized there was a problem it s coming out now because it s close to election time and it keeps your eyes focused on that instead of other issues they thought it would never come out if no one knows about it , it might go away no news is good news on members of congress do you think most members of congress do or do not try to follow the same rules for behavior as average americans \? donald hudson , indianapolis most congressmen believe they belong to a select group , a group that is entitled , even though we all know they are there to serve the people they use that entitlement not always for the people they are serving , but for their own benefits they use money they get for mailing lists for political purposes , for profit they use their privilege of office for sporting events how many of our congressmen take these foreign trips that don t have anything to do with the constituency they represent at home right here in indianapolis we have a member of congress , julia carson , who is a democrat , and when she was had her first office , she did a good job and served the people but when she was elected to congress , for one whole year she had the lowest attendance of any congressperson jerry lutkenhouse , groton , ny they do as they damn well please since the sixties everybody decided their own moralities it s part of the whole society thing , but they re in the vanguard of being the bad boys it s a closed club , they re not going to rat on each other the whole purpose of congress , it would seem , is to maintain its power give me thomas jefferson s idea farmers come in , serve their couple of terms , and go back they re there to serve the people and not themselves let s talk about robert byrd , what is he , 84 , and running again why \? there s nothing in the state that isn t named after him already he certainly doesn t need the money it s power initially they may say i m going to serve two terms and quit then after the second term they say , well i haven t finished the job , and four terms later they re still there and running again and collecting funds mary raines , mount vernon , ky they re all for money they re attracted to running because of that and they know they can get it money that kind of covers it nicholas brown , portsmouth , va i just think people , when they climb to high places in the world we live in , don t feel like the rules apply to them that is true not only for members of congress , but for anyone in a public office , or for executives in companies i don t think they feel like the rules of society apply to them susan sauer , cookeville , tenn maybe because they can do it maybe it s just expedient to cut corners and not have to follow the way we have to follow they think why not take advantage of it don patterson , blairsville , ga i think it s true of both parties i think we need term limits i think these guys stay so long they think they re running things they re doing it their way and i don t think they re in touch with their base like this latest scandal with foley , there s no way both the republican and the democrats didn t know it i think it s well past the time when some of these guys need to be gone i think there s an inside the beltway mentality i don t think they re really in sync with the rest of the country and they re so used to trading off and compromising and accommodating that the morals get traded too angela montoya , orting , wash they have more connections they know the other people in congress , they know the political system they can cover up things and get away with more because they know people it doesn t matter who you are , it s who you know i don t care which party it is jean fortier , chester , nh because they have power and money , they tend to think they re above the law i think that s something that happens in office , when you have all these lobbyists and special interests coming at you go to article go to complete results
in 2004 , the new york state legislature finally enacted changes to the draconian rockefeller drug laws that imposed long mandatory sentences on major and minor drug dealers the goal of these changes \( later supplemented by further minor reform last year \) was to prevent firsttime nonviolent offenders especially lowlevel dealers and addicts selling to support their drug habits from serving unreasonably lengthy jail sentences the new law , the drug law reform act , reduced penalties , eliminated life sentences and afforded more pleabargaining options , among other things while the changes themselves were less extensive than what many of us had hoped for , it was a good beginning , especially since it gave judges discretion to lower sentences that were unduly harsh for lowlevel , nonviolent offenders no one envisioned that the sentences of drug kingpins would be reduced now the first report that details at least some of the cases resentenced under the new law must force us to reexamine these changes unfortunately , according to the comprehensive report by bridget brennan , new york city s special prosecutor for narcotics , of the 84 drug offenders who applied for resentencing under the new law , only one was a firsttime , lowlevel , nonviolent offender instead , drug kingpins , or major dealers and leaders of drug organizations , received some of the biggest sentence reductions , as did some defendants with felony records , drug suppliers and dealers with large amounts of narcotics and weapons and , sadly , almost no women benefited from the new law why has this happened \? because the new legislation allowed all convicted highlevel drug offenders to apply for resentencing and the majority of those offenders were significant drug dealers or had violated the public trust i presided as a judge in the new york state supreme court on a number of those cases according to the law , all applicants for resentencing were to be returned to their sentencing judge , which makes sense since that judge would know the most about each case but a number of judges , like me , retired , and the cases were sent to other judges as a result , their resentencings were inconsistent and gave rise to some shocking results the new statute itself creates a strong legislative preference , if not a presumption , in favor of resentencing , and this is a problem take alejandro lopez mr lopez was the leader of a large and violent crack cocaine organization that infested the lower east side of new york city for many years he threatened the two lead detectives in his case and their families mr lopez fled to puerto rico but was ultimately returned to my court , where a jury convicted him of the highestlevel felony for possession of drugs and conspiracy i sentenced him to the maximum 331 3 years to life and a 3 million fine \( none of it ever paid \) at a resentencing hearing before another judge , mr lopez was resentenced to only 17 years miguelina gilbert , who had been selling cocaine for at least two years while on duty as a new york state parole officer , was convicted of the highestlevel felony for selling drugs i sentenced her to 15 years to life another judge resentenced her to eight years , and she was released from jail last year a jury convicted luis torres , a leader of a large lower east side cocaine and heroin organization employing 30 managers , of the highestlevel felony for possession of drugs , his fifth felony conviction i sentenced him to 50 years to life and a 1 million fine \( which he has never paid \) he is awaiting resentencing before another judge , and his sentence may well be reduced but the most disturbing news from the report is that fewer defendants are seeking drug treatment as a sentencing option because they now have less incentive to trade shorter prison sentences for long , rigorous treatment programs if that result continues to prove accurate , one of the primary goals of the drug law reform will have failed the report proposes what many of us have long advocated a drug kingpin statute we must separate those minor , nonviolent offenders who do n't deserve unfair sentences from violent drug dealers who deserve every minute of the sentences they received but we also need to establish a procedure that ensures some consistency and rationality in sentencing reform judicial discretion is critical but resentencing should be permitted only in cases that involve insignificant amounts of drugs , no violence , no drug organization , no weapons and no employment of children under 16 the important point is that drug law reform must continue , but in a rational and intelligent manner it must promote fairness for those who deserve it , treat drug kingpins appropriately and encourage drug treatment sadly , the new law that i had so much hope in has succeeded in reducing sentences , but , it appears , primarily for those who should remain incarcerated
helen fisher admits that she was dumbfounded when a friend told her one night when they were out for dinner that he was still , after many years of marriage , madly in love with his wife really \? wow , said dr fisher , who is an anthropology professor at rutgers university and has written several books on human and animal love , divorce and mating then i talked to his wife , and out of nowhere , she says , 'i'm still madly in love with my husband , ' which made me even more astounded it was then , she said , that she knew the time was right to take up an offer made by matchcom , one of the largest internet dating services , to be the company s scientific adviser for its new service , chemistrycom while it seems incongruous for a serious anthropologist to hook up , so to speak , with a dating service , dr fisher has become comfortable with the idea maybe i am pretending , but i think we are all interested in romantic love , and here is a company whose entire business is about romantic love , dr fisher said recently in her upper east side apartment , which was filled with a clutter of notes and shelves overflowing with books on the mind and body i am going to have data on more than 200 , 000 people about matching i think it will be the first big analysis , scientific analysis , of a great deal of data on this it does n't matter , though , if it is not the first whatever it is will be enormously interesting to me the purpose of chemistrycom is to link potential dates through an evaluation of their chances for romantic love the company s officers found dr fisher through her most recent book , why we love the nature and chemistry of romantic love \( henry holt , 2004 \) in it , dr fisher tries to make connections between the amount of several chemicals in the body dopamine , testosterone , estrogen and serotonin and whether they attract or repel potential mates in doing the research for the chemistrycom questionnaire , dr fisher then translated the chemical biological part of her work into personality traits and came up with four basic types of people explorers have an excess of dopamine , which makes them curious , energetic , creative and optimistic those with more serotonin she calls builders , and they are calm , conscientious , dutiful and loyal she calls people with high levels of estrogen negotiators because they are sympathetic , intuitive , imaginative and have good people skills those with high testosterone levels , the directors , are assertive , direct , ambitious and decisive i started reading these books on personality , and over and over and over i saw that plato , aristotle , karl jung , myers and briggs and a lot of others tended to put people into four very broad categories , she said , noting that depending on the situation , similar traits or opposing traits attract mates those four categories corresponded with my understanding of the brain systems that hooked me apparently , americans are also hooked on internet dating services a recent survey by the pew internet and american life project shows that 11 percent of all internet users , more than 16 million people , have filled out a profile for an online dating service when you consider that only a small segment of americans are single and actively looking for a partner , that number is even more impressive , said mary madden , the lead author for the pew study rather than dismiss dr fisher s type of research , ms madden said her study shows that an increasing number of people are trusting internet dating the public discussion of online romance has certainly changed , she said if you looked at press clippings from 1998 , there is a different way of talking about online daters those stories talked a lot about the fear of potential mates lying or other bad things now , as people have had success , the stories are about people getting married or even grandmothers using it according to the latest online publishers association study , americans spent 469 million on internet dating services in 2004 still , dr fisher said she was never overly enthusiastic or skeptical about internet dating , but on the other hand , was never a fan , as an anthropologist anyway , of that other typical dating format the bar scene who says that going to a bar is natural \? she said way back to the grasslands of africa for millions of years , long before you met somebody , you knew their parents , their background , you certainly knew what a lot of people thought of them matchmakers are thousands of years old meeting through agents of one variety or another is millions of years old walking into a bar , where you know nobody , do n't know these people s intentions , do n't know whether they are married or single , do n't know whether they will court you tonight and leave town tomorrow , that is what is odd , strange , unnatural in many ways , this is a more natural system dr fisher , 60 , grew up an identical twin , with an older stepbrother and an older stepsister , in new canaan , conn her parents , she said , were lovers of the arts who also seemed to be in love with each other she said that even as a child , she had the makings of an anthropologist
as naturally handsome as the new jersey landscape is , there is always room for another civic monument and that is the logic behind monumental , a mindbending exhibition at victory hall stocked with a dozen artists' ideas for imaginary monuments to new jersey all i can say is that i sincerely hope none of them is ever built somewhere along the way in the planning for this exhibition the concept turned from being a halfserious proposal to what feels like a bit of a jest fest the problem is that the organizers forgot to tell all of the artists , hence the somewhat incongruous mix of serious proposals and raving parodies , resulting in a curatorial misfire short of waving a magic wand , there is no way to beautify eastern new jersey s crazy quilt of urban and industrial sprawl what to do \? according to many of the artists showing here , the answer is obvious further blight the landscape with junkylooking monuments made out of trash , abandoned cars , toxic waste and the like oh , dear high on the list of irreverent parodies of traditional monuments is jay boucher s idea to install an immense concrete reproduction of a median barrier over the entrance to the new jersey turnpike , with the monument doubling as a tollbooth he has even concocted a digital photograph to show us what it would look like it s hilarious oddly enough , the idea has local cultural relevance given that the poured concrete median barrier was first developed in the 1950 s by the state of new jersey s highway department mr boucher , in an artist statement , also reveals that the present concrete barrier design was created specifically in 1959 to try to keep cars from driving into oncoming traffic across the state s rapidly growing highway system from here the exhibition drifts into fantasyland , with curt ikens s plan for lady jersey , a monument showing an unobstructed view of the statue of liberty s backside \( the view of the monument as seen from new jersey \) surrounded by a tangle of smokestacks that spew continuous plumes of smoke and dust mr ikens would like the monument to be sited atop the 150foottall snake hill rock , just off the new jersey turnpike in the meadowlands he even has a finance plan of sorts , trenton style , proposing that it all be built at taxpayers' expense via a nobid contract in a separate state budget initiative several other zany submissions also propose to foul parks and civic sites with nastylooking monuments there are monuments made of scavenged rubbish , rusted and burnedout cars , and telephone wire and plastic bags one artist even proposes building a reflective sky dome over all of jersey city now that would be a monument by the time you have worked your way around these proposals , you are apt to find the more serious fare stuffy and oldfashioned and it is , mostly , ranging from hohum designs for fountains to a proposal for the creation of garden and recreation areas around public housing developments throughout new jersey sorry , but it is hard to get excited about this one of the few genuinely sensible suggestions is joe heaps nelson s proposal for a monument to new jersey s rock 'n' rollers he proposes a triumphal arch adorned with sculptures of great new jersey rockers like patti smith and jon bon jovi the monument design could be improved , but you ca n't fault the sentiment here , at last , is something for us to be proud of monumental , victory hall , 186 grand street , jersey city , through april 24 information \( 201 \) 2090510 or on the web at www victoryhall org photos joe heaps nelson s proposal for a monument to new jersey s rock 'n' rollers top , jay boucher wants to install an immense concrete reproduction of a median barrier over the entrance to the new jersey turnpike , left , 'paytoplay' land by keungsuk k sexton

matsui obviously must know , they re right behind him anyone else know \? carlos guillen , the tigers shortstop , is up next he barely misses a 30 fastball from wang the count runs full and guillen walks two on , none out  ivan rodriguez , the catcher is up and after faking a bunt , the runners go and pudge misses it before posada guns out ordonez at third one out , runner on second  now rodriguez strikes out on a sinker down and away 2 out  craig monroe , apparently in a hurry , grounds the first pitch to jeter at short , and he s out , after a somewhat comic wobble by sheffield who caught the ball at first , but looked surprised by the whole exchange 3 outs , but wang was lucky to get out of that so easily bottom of the second inning giambi is plunked with the first pitch and heads for first runner on first , no outs  arod comes to the plate to cheers from the crowd and chatter from the commentary box on the highestpaid player in the game sitting sixth given that a pregame graphic reminded us that arod s a career 306 hitter in the postseason , dwelling on his poor first round showing last season seems a little myopic arod lines a 32 pitch that s snagged by polanco at second giambi is luckily slow enough that he wasn t far from first and makes it back without gettign doubled up 1 out  matsui , looking a bit rushed himself , pops up to the left side 2 out  posada grounds a single through the center two on , 2 out  robinson cano , who must be the player with the highest regular season batting average ever to hit 9th in the playoffs , steps up and grounds weakly to third as i was saying typical 9th place hitter inning over  top of the third inning marcus thames , the dh , slaps one down the left field line whoops , matsui thought it was touched by a fan and stopped playing the ball long enough to let thames get to second for a sort of double runner on second , no outs  brandon inge grounds out to arod at third , who keeps the runner from moving over and then throws , somewhat wide of the bag to first , but sheff makes the play 1 out  here s granderson for his second crack at wang he pulls a ball through the infield for a single but the thirdbase coach holds thames , respecting abreu s arm 1st and 3rd , one out  polanco is ready to hit , but wang throws over to hold granderson at first the tigers seem ready to gamble , will he go \? i was just about to say they should send him if he can run at all , sicne wang is a sinkerball pitcher and a double play would get the yanks out of this but then polanco grounded it to jeter s left , he made a nice play and they turned two , with sheffield at full stretch is a sort of balletic split holding on to cano s throw at first inning over again though , the tigers are a lot closer to scoring so far off wang than the yankees have been off robertson bottom of the third inning back to the top of the yanks order damon is up and hits a very slow roller past the pitcher that he misses for some reason damon beats it out runner on , no outs  here s jeter 32 count , will damon go \? yes indeed and jeter lines one in the leftcenter gap granderson cuts it off and they hold damon at third jeter slides in to second for a double second and third , none out  abreu has a shot to put the yanks ahead \( a reply shows that fox announcer tim mccarver is right sending damon moved the tigers shortstop toward the bag , allowing jeter s line drive to get through the infield \) abreu drills a slider to rightcenter for a double of his own two runs in , runner on second , no outs  sheffield quickly pummels a linedrive single to right abreu is in easily and suddenly it s 30 runner on first , no one out giambi follows he skies one into the upper deck on the right , but , this not being cricket , it doesn t count foul ball but this one does giambi pops one into the short porch in left for a home run 50 no one on , no one out robertson s reward arod he lines a single to left robertson may be updating that blog of his again pretty soon runner on first , none out  matsui hits a high fly towards the kanji on the wall in right , but granderson settles under it and makes the catch runner on first , one out  that gives me an opportunity to thank reader iyasu nagata , who writes in to tell us that the japanese characters on the wall in leftcenter say yomiuri shimbun , the name of the newspaper that owns the yomiuri giants , the team matsui starred on in his playing days in japan imagine that , a newspaper owning a baseball team posada loops a fly down the rightfield line and maggio ordonez makes a very nice grab which also gives me a chance to mention that ordonez has some serious hair out there under his cap runner on first , two out  cano , inspired by his place in the batting order , flies out to left , a shell of the al player of the month for september inning over  top of the fourth inning casey at the bat but not that one , this one flies out to matsui in left still , no joy in motorville 1 out  ordonez steps up and flies out to his opposite number , abreu , in right on the first pitch 2 out  getting back to the tangential language questions that are vexing the nation , reader joel engel chimes in with the thought that i m guessing that the dodgers had a korean translator and a japanese translator when chan ho park and hideo nomo were with the team anyone out there know for sure that neither nomo nor park spoke english \? guillen laces yet another double down the left field line runner on second , 2 outs  here s pudge he falls behind 02 before laying off two sinkers down and away 22 he barely gets a piece of the next pitch foultipping it at posada , who can t hang on but that just delayed the inevitable wang strikes him out swinging on another sinker off the plate inning over  bottom of the fourth inning last inning the yankees all got to bat , so damon is up again to lead this one off let s see if robertson learned anything from that experience by the way , an article in the michigan press reminds us that robertson is one of 9 current tigers who were also on the same tiger team that went 43119 and set an american league record for most losses in a season anyone know what the major league record for losses in a season is , and which new york club set it \? damon flies out to left 1 out  jeter lines a single to right runner on first , one out  abreu is up next and can t get to a high and tight pitch on a hit and run jeter is caught in a run down and tagged out on his way back to first no one on now , two away  abreu skies out to left on a 31 pitch that he might ve taken for ball 4 if this didn t feel like batting practice now inning over what did robertson learn \? top of the fifth inning while we wait for things to start up again , are there any readers following this from taiwan or japan \? if so , let us know what s happening where you are how are closely are fans really following the us game \? here s craig monroe , in from left field for a little while as if to punish me for implying detroit was never going to get going , he immediately cranks a fastball straight over the 408 sign in dead center for a home run 51 no one out  thames flows to the plate he quickly chops the ball to jeter at short , who continues the yankee infielder game of make sheff stretch by winging it towards , but not actually right to the novice first baseman 1 out  inge dumps a single into right and my tv inexplicably goes out uhoh ah good , it comes right back and i just missed a pitch apparently it was a strike on granderson runner on first , 1 out  granderson skies it to left runner on first , two out  polanco slices yet another double to right , down the rightfield line inge scores , 52 runner on second , 2 outs  has the highscoring softball game begun \? that wasn t very well hit , but then again neither was giambi s home run casey again at the bat this time he hits the 95th double of the game for the tigers and drives in another run 53 now runner on second , 2 outs  ordonez strikes out inning over but game on bottom of the fifth inning a reader identifying himself as donald feldman writes in to complain about my typos , implying that i can t spell unless he s related to ee cummings , i d counter by saying that he should start using capital letters for his first and last names before he complains again though seriously , given that we are doing this live as it happens , readers will have to forgive us our typos there s no spellcheck in wordpress and not much time to even read over what we re writing , at this pace sheffield pops out to second 1 out  giambi , is plunked again by robertson runner on first , 1 out  arod looks at a pitch on the corner and it slowly dawns on him that he s been called out on strikes runner on first , 2 out  matsui chops it to the pitcher inning over  top of the sixth inning guillen starts things off for the tigers in the sixth the count runs full guillen grounds to cano at second 1 out  pudge , who , to be frank , doesn t look at all overweight to me , returns to see if he can do better against wang he s struck out twice so far this time he makes contact , barely , grounding to jeter 2 outs where d that softball game go \? monroe follows his gamereigniting homer with a grounder to thrid arod look untroubled by it , and so does sheffield on the other end maybe he s going to be fine there inning over  bottom of the sixth inning posada hits a sharp grounder to third inge handles it and easily throws out jorge 1 out  is it just me , or is cano actually now hitting like a 9th place hitter all of a sudden \? he dribbles a very weak grounder to the left side and is thrown out 2 out  damon is next he reaches out and slaps a ball into left for a single runner on first , 2 out  jeter lines his fourth hit to left damon heads for third , that draws a weak throw in that direction , allowing jeter to make it another double runners on second and third , 2 outs  abreu , pulls a ball along the ground that is about 6 inches beyond the glove of the diving polanco damon and jeter both score 73 runner on first , 2 out that s it for robertson , he heads off to the clubhouse to blog well how about that , they replaced robertson with grilli and his first contribution was to throw over the head of the first baseman sean casey and the ball goes into the seats , abreu to second sheffield grounds out to short inning over top of the seventh inning thames is up , briefly , then he s on his way back to the dugout , having struck out in the meantime 1 out  here s inge he slaps a 22 pitch up the middle , but cano backhands it and throws him out 2 outs  yankee manager joe torre s seen enough of all these ground ball outs and he heads out to the mound to remove wang the fans at the stadium seem as uneasy as i am at this development , but give wang a nice ovation as he walks off here comes the start of a new era in new york yankee postseason baseball , in which mariano rivera is a oneinning pitcher and the bridge to him is made of rope myers is in to pitch to granderson he uncorks a couple of slow sidearm balls towards the plate and then granderson figures that delivery out and nails a 22 pitch deep into the right field seats for a home run 74 myers is done what a strange job it is to come in and pitch to one guy hard to feel good about your day at the office if it goes like that scott proctor comes in to spell myers no one on , 2 out polanco slots a single into rightcenter runner on first , 2 outs  casey up , proctor falls behind him 20 and yankee fans , along with the nation of taiwan , wish wang could come back in proctor gets the count to 22 and the fans at the stadium rise and cheer for a strikeout but scott proctor is not exactly ramiro mendoza and he gives up a single to right that sends polanco to third first and third , 2 outs \( the ones earned by wang \)  ordonez hits a high fly to rightcenter that damon snags after calling off abreu inning over and one of the three irish tenors appears to sing god bless america during the 7th inning stretch thoughts during the seventh inning stretch tiger fans have to like the life their club is showing after falling behind early by 5 runs in yankee stadium in october yankee fans have to hope that kyle farnsworth , who will no doubt be in for the 8th , has better success in the postseason as a yankee than he did as a brave bottom of the seventh inning jamie walker is in to pitch for detroit he walks giambi runner on first , no one out  arod lines out to right he s unlucky that it was right at ordonez runner on first , 1 out matsui grounds into a well it should ve been a double play but matsui hustled down the line and beat it out runner on first , 2 outs  posada lines a single to right and matsui continues to make like charlie hustle and gets to third runners on first and third , 2 outs  cano , who suddenly can t buy a hit , gets under one and flies out to right inning over  top of the eighth inning well i guess joe torre has not been as impressed with gary sheffield s defensive work at first base as i have he s out and andy phillips is in as a defensive replacement kyle farnsworth is indeed in to pitch for the yanks he quickly falls behind carlos guillen 30 and follows that up with ball four a leadoff walk runner on first , no one out  ivan rodriguez steps in and farnsworth falls behind 20 right away yankee fans in the stadium look worried pudge bails farnsworth out by getting out in front of a pitch that he could have hammered for a long fly out to left runner on first , 1 out  here s craig monroe , who beat the yankees with a late homer in the regular season another 21 count and monroe swings for the bleachers but misses the fastball 22 count called strike three runner on first , 2 out  thames is up and guess what \? first pitch ball followed by another 20 30 the fans cheer the called strike 1 thames fouls one back 32 thames fouls a ball down the right field line we re a pitch from rivera , but also maybe a pitch from a onerun game the way thames seems to be measuring up farnsworth s fastball but no he takes a mighty cut and pops it to jeter in short left he then slams his bat into the ground as if he was expecting to hit it out too farnsworth escapes and we ll soon see if mariano rivera s elbow is really better inning over  bottom of the eighth inning damon is up to face walker let me take a moment to thank reader slim , who correctly points out that it was indeed the mets who set the major league record for losses in a single season with 120 in 1962 damon strikes out 1 out  jeter caps his night with a home run to straightaway center he s 5 for 5 the fans at the stadium are chanting derek jeter ! ! ! jeter s not taking any curtain calls in the middle of a playoff game abreu grounds out no one on , 2 outs  andy phillips steps in the first batter for the yankees this evening to have never played in an allstar game he hits a long fly to center , but not long enough inning over  top of the ninth inning well this is , in all likelihood , it rivera is on the mound then again , he will eventually fail at this , right \? and who s to say when it will start inge is in on tv , tim mccarver is describing where exactly the pain in rivera s elbow is oddly enough , it seems to be just about where my own elbow hurts , thanks to this new mouse i m using high pop up to first on a 32 count phillips calls for it , snags it 1 out  granderson bloops the ball just over the infield for a single runner on first , 1 out  rivera starts polanco off by nearly hitting him then he induces a double play grounder to cano , who tosses the ball to jeter who then flings it to phillips to end the game which leads me to this statement game over  postgame thoughts well , the tigers certainly had their chances to score more runs and their bullpen looked strong in the middle innings , but the fact is that s 6 straight losses for them in meaningful games they re certainly in a bit of a skid as for the yankees , they ll score a lot of runs in this postseason , but they ll very likely need to with a bullpen like this thanks for all your comments and support , sorry i didn t have a chance to respond to everyone join us again tomorrow at 4pm et for the mets and the dodgers and come back again tomorrow night to see what happens in the next game between the yanks and the tigers oh , and tell your friends we re here good night from new york
when the los angeles dodgers supplanted san diego in first place in the national league west on thursday , they completed a remarkable cycle their climb to the top meant they had been in every one of the five places in the division standings since the allstar game on the other hand , there is nothing remarkable in that division about a team spending time in every place in the standings expanding the time to the entire season , every one of the division s five teams has been in every one of the five positions no other division can make that claim that prompted a question for ned colletti , the dodgers' rookie general manager what will be the order of finish in the division \? a fiveway tie , he said , laughing why not , as improbable as that outcome may be \? this is a division waiting to be taken , and it has no takers the padres , who last season nearly became the first division champion with a losing record , seemed to be in control , holding the top spot for about six weeks except for one day but for that period , they had a 500 record 2222 which only shows how inept the division has been it may be that the team that is hot in the final weeks of the season will finish first , regardless of its standing at the moment that team , in recent weeks , has been the dodgers on july 26 , after losing 8 games in a row and 13 of 14 , the dodgers were in last place , seven and a half games behind the padres then they won 11 straight \( and 14 of 15 after yesterday s win over the giants \) suddenly , they are in first place i do n't think we were as bad as when we lost 13 of 14 , colletti said nor do i expect us to win 12 out of every 13 but in the days and hours leading to the nonwaiver trading deadline , on july 31 , colletti made trades designed to strengthen the dodgers' chances of being closer to the latter team than the former he acquired greg maddux from the chicago cubs for the starting rotation and wilson betemit from atlanta and julio lugo from tampa bay for the infield we 've struggled all year to hit home runs , colletti said last year s freeagent market was n't abundant with home run hitters home run hitters are becoming like no 1 and 2 starters they 're tough to come by we wanted to find someone who can drive it out that s betemit on betemit s 26th birthday , july 28 , the dodgers obtained him for danys b \? , a veteran reliever , and willy aybar , a rookie infielder although he hit only 4 home runs in 115 games \( 246 atbats \) for the braves last season , betemit , a third baseman , hit 9 in 88 games \( 199 atbats \) for them this season and slugged three in his first nine games with the dodgers with jeff kent on the disabled list , colletti wanted middleinfield insurance , and 75 minutes before the deadline he called the devil rays about lugo lugo can play all over the place , including the outfield , colletti said at the same time he continued to pursue maddux trying to get maddux out of chicago was n't easy , colletti said , referring to his talks with the cubs' general manager , jim hendry jimmy wanted some of our top prospects , and we were of a mind not to do that a month earlier hendry had asked the dodgers about c \? r izturis , whom rafael furcal had replaced as the dodgers' shortstop , and was told they did not want to trade him but knowing he could get lugo , colletti at the last hour offered izturis for maddux we made the deals within seconds of each other , colletti said with kent back from the disabled list , the dodgers have an extra infielder we do today , colletti said , suggesting that perhaps another deal could be forthcoming as for adding maddux , who has seen better days , colletti said i 've known greg since he signed his first professional contract in chicago i know he does n't possess cy young stuff anymore , but he s the smartest pitcher i 've ever been around i felt he would add stability and leadership to the pitching staff the 11game winning streak began the night of the first trade , but colletti was not ready to cite cause and complete effect we announced the betemit trade right as the game began , he said i'm not sure that was something everybody got excited about and said here we go but monday when they land in cincinnati they find out they have lugo and maddux with them that has to give them a boost it gives the team a little bit of faith and a little confidence now the dodgers will try to win the division title colletti knows they will not be alone i'm not sure , but i do n't think you can look at anybody and say they ca n't make it , he said shouldering responsibility on the one hand , there is gary majewski s shoulder on the other , there is kip wells s shoulder one is suspicious the other is not pitchers both , they were traded recently , majewski by washington to cincinnati , wells by pittsburgh to texas majewski is on the disabled list with a sore right shoulder wells missed a start with the rangers because of an inflamed right shoulder the cases prompted questions about the teams receiving damaged goods wayne krivsky , the reds' general manager , did not want to make a cause c \? bre out of the majewski incident , but he was not ignoring it either
for a while , the wireless internet connection christine and randy brodeur installed last year seemed perfect they were able to sit in their sunny los angeles backyard working on their laptop computers but they soon began noticing that their highspeed internet access had become as slow as rushhour traffic on the 405 freeway i did n't know whether to blame it on the santa ana winds or what , recalled mrs brodeur , the chief executive of socket media , a marketing and public relations agency the what turned out to be neighbors who had tapped into their system the additional online traffic nearly choked out the brodeurs , who pay a 40 monthly fee for their internet service , slowing their access until it was practically unusable piggybacking , the usually unauthorized tapping into someone else s wireless internet connection , is no longer the exclusive domain of pilfering computer geeks or shady hackers cruising for unguarded networks ordinarily upstanding people are tapping in as they do , new sets of internet behaviors are creeping into america s popular culture i do n't think it s stealing , said edwin caroso , a 21yearold student at miami dade college , echoing an oftenheard sentiment i always find people out there who are n't protecting their connection , so i just feel free to go ahead and use it , mr caroso said he added that he tapped into a stranger s network mainly for web surfing , keeping up with email , text chatting with friends in foreign countries and doing homework many who piggyback say the practice does not feel like theft because it does not seem to take anything away from anyone one occasional piggybacker recently compared it to reading the newspaper over someone s shoulder piggybacking , makers of wireless routers say , is increasingly an issue for people who live in densely populated areas like new york city or chicago , or for anyone clustered in apartment buildings in which wifi radio waves , with an average range of about 200 feet , can easily bleed through walls , floors and ceilings large hotels that offer the service have become bubbling brooks of free access that spill out into nearby homes and restaurants wifi is in the air , and it is a very low curb , if you will , to step up and use it , said mike wolf of abi research , a hightechnology market research company in oyster bay , ny this is especially true , mr wolf said , because so many users do not bother to secure their networks with passwords or encryption programs the programs are usually shipped with customers' wireless routers , devices that plug into an internet connection and make access to it wireless many home network owners admit that they are oblivious to piggybackers some , like marla edwards , who think they have locked intruders out of their networks , learn otherwise ms edwards , a junior at baruch college in new york , said her husband recently discovered that their home network was not secure after a visiting friend with a laptop easily hopped on there s no gauge , no measuring device that says 48 people are using your access , ms edwards said when mr wolf turns on his computer in his suburban seattle home , he regularly sees on his screen a list of two or three wireless networks that do not belong to him but are nonetheless available for use mr wolf uses his own wired network at home , but he says he has piggybacked onto someone else s wireless network when traveling on a family vacation this summer we needed to get access , mr wolf recalled , explaining that his father , who took along his laptop , needed to send an email message to his boss on the east coast from ocean shores , wash i said , 'ok , let s drive around the beach with the window open' we found a signal , and the owner of the network was none the wiser , mr wolf said it took about five minutes jonathan bettino , a senior product marketing manager for the belkin corporation , a major maker of wireless network routers based in compton , calif , said homebased wireless networks were becoming a way of life unless locking out unauthorized users becomes commonplace , piggybacking is likely to increase , too last year , mr bettino said , there were more than 44 million broadband networks among the more than 100 million households in the united states of that number , 162 million are expected to be wireless by the end of this year in 2003 , 39 million households had wireless access to the internet , he said humphrey cheung , the editor of a technology web site , tomshardwarecom , measured how plentiful open wireless networks have become in april 2004 , he and some colleagues flew two singleengine airplanes over metropolitan los angeles with two wireless laptops the project logged more than 4 , 500 wireless networks , with only about 30 percent of them encrypted to lock out outsiders , mr cheung said most people just plug the thing in , he said of those who buy wireless routers ninety percent of the time it works you stop at that point and do n't bother to turn on its security
wrapup an outstanding pitching performance by rogers and the tigers bullpen on a night that shouldn t have been pitchers weather with seven straight postseason wins in the can , this tiger team looks like a juggernaut their offense wasn t spectacular , but the tigers hitters seized the opportunities they got harden s rocky start and a big fat mistake out over the plate for monroe to drive in the fifth and got it done if you re an oakland fan , it s a rotten spot for your team to be in , having to not just find a way to beat these tigers , but to do it four times in a row , starting in a chilly comerica park tomorrow for tigers fans , what a great bandwagon to be riding the team of destiny sign in the stands looks truer every minute thanks to all of you for your comments , and thanks to carla and her associates for keeping the conversation going stick around for our live game tracking of the cardinals at the mets , game two of the nlcs , getting underway here in just a short while neil genzlinger will be blogging that one , while carla let s blog two ! baranauckas will be moderating once again good night ! top of the ninth todd jones pitching for the tigers jones quickly gets to 02 on kendall rally rags again , though they are looking a little weak now tiger fans already have this one half in their pockets mentally , and who can blame em kendall taps to third , easy out , one away now jones is ahead of kotsay , 02 roller to polanco , makes the tough play , and the a s are down to their last out , with bradley up bradley grounds the first pitch up the middle , an easy play , side retired bottom of the eighth mark kiger replaces jimenez at second base his major league debut ! first time that s ever happened in post season play , the annnouncers tell us kiko cakero pitching for the a s rodriguez flies to right , one away alexis gomez pinchhits for the dh , infante a fly ball to left nearly falls in for extra bases , but drops just foul gomez comes back to drive a 32 pitch to center for a single man on first , one out jones is up in the tiger bullpen inge strikes out on a 22 breaking ball two out , man on first fox updates us on zumaya it s tendinitis in the wrist , they ve been treating it all day , tigers hope he will be available for game 4 santiago s groundball to short is shoveled to kiger to make the force play at second and retire the side kiger gets his first bigleague statistic a putout top of the eighth john in the comment area is ready to leave rogers in there until he fades the way this series is going , there might not be much need for a game six starter swisher takes ball one from rogers kenny s pitchers are starting to climb up in and above the strike zone he s now behind 30 swisher takes a couple of strikes and then works out a walk rodney is warmed up in the tigers bullpen , and there s a conference on the mound , but kenny rogers stays in the game , to a roar from the crowd rogers gets ahead of scutaro , 02 the rallyrags are helicoptering all over the stadium doesn t the breeze from them make the fans even colder \?

indeed they do a throw to second almost goes into the outfield , but scutaro saves it polanco bunts left of the mound , gaudin fields it and gets it to third fast , nailing the lead runner one out , man on first and second on the replay it looks like granderson beat the ball to third easier to shrug off if you re winning ordonez grounds to short , should be a dp , but the throw to first is in the dirt swisher knocks it down but recovers to keep monroe from making the turn and scoring two out , men on first and third pitching change , the a s bring in joe kennedy to face guillen the fox announcers are slamming jiminez for protecting himself from the runner as he made the pivot at second , and maybe costing the a s the dp a tapper to third by guillen ends the inning side retired top of the seventh thomas swings at the first pitch and he flies to foul ground in right he can t seem to do a thing in this series , whether he s patient or aggressive at the plate one out play manager if rogers keeps cruising like this through seven , do you let him go for the completegame shutout \? let us know payton strikes out two away the rally rags are awhirl again , and the detroit fans are loving rogers s performance here a slow tapper to first on a 32 pitch , guillen takes it to the bag even though rogers is there covering , and chavez is out easily side retired bottom of the sixth hi liska , thanks , glad you re able to keep up with the action at work if your boss hassles you , get tommy lasorda on the phone to explain it all for you \( i like those promos fox is running , with lasorda exhorting baseball fans to watch even if their own teams are done for the year \) rodriguez lines the first pitch softly to jiminez , one out infante strikes out swinging two out inge draws a walk chad gaudin is up in the bullpen , harden may be done harden is out of the game , he went 5 1 3 , gave up 5 hits , 3 runs , struck out 3 , walked 5 gaudin pitching he starts santiago with a ball after running the count full , santiago flies to left , side retired top of the sixth the top of the a s order tries again to get something going against rogers a sliding catch by ordonez on a sinking liner to right retires kendall one out kotsay can catch but he can t do much with what rogers is throwing , he grounds weakly to short two out there s doom in the eyes of these athletics if they can t find a way to get to the tigers bullpen soon , they re in deep trouble and even then , the prospects aren t so great but the score is still fairly close rogers has gone to a full count on bradley , just missing outside , and then bradley fouls one off but he swings at the next breaking ball and strikes out , side retired bottom of the fifth if he keeps throwing five or six or seven pitches to each batter , this could be harden s last inning even if he goes threeup , three down monroe slams the second pitch he sees over the wall in leftcenter home run , 30 tigers polanco lines softly to first one out ordonez bounces to third two out the game has really started to speed up , the atbats are much shorter , one or two pitches each maybe harden will survive into the sixth after all , against all the odds is leyland willing to stick with the kid \? guillen flies to center , side retired whoops , got my managers crossed make that , will macha stick with harden \? top of the fifth harden owes katson a steak dinner for those two plays in the bottom of the fourth , saving a run or more unusually , rogers starts swisher with a ball then a grounder to the bag at third and a strong throw by inge retires swisher one out scutaro finds a way to plow a rogers breaking ball into right for a single man on first , one out rogers has missed outside to all three batters so far this inning but he gets jimenez to roll to third , double play , side retired bottom of the fourth david k in our comments section recommends that the a s stall until it starts to snow ! the old jack frost play rarely comes up in the regular season considering how he s pitched , harden is lucky not to be behind by more than two he s still in there but he s still throwing a lot of pitches to each batter , going to a full count before giving up a leadoff single to center inge swings at a fastball , and harden gets his third strikeout with his 71st pitch one out , man on first harden throws over and infante , the runner at first , dives back infante takes off on 20 and kendall pops up to throw , but nobody covers second , and infante is in uncontested with a stolen base with the count now 30 , santiago shows bunt and takes a strike , then takes again another full count he pushes a sinking liner to center that kotsay just barely gets to infante has to scurry back two out , man on second action in the a s bullpen blanton warming up kotsay makes a great running catch in right center to retire granderson and end the inning \( fixed my previous misspelling of blanton \) top of the fourth tatsataum in our comment section asks why all the good teams are in the east and midwest interesting question , especially since fewer and fewer players seem to come from coldweather country rogers looks positively serene out there , getting ahead 02 on frank thomas he strikes out looking , and still isn t off the schneid against these tigers one out jay payton swings at the first pitch and turns it into the second out chavez is chasing breaking balls outside that are under 80 mph and gets behind 12 , then swings through a fastishball for strike 3 side retired bottom of the third the comments section has gone as cold as an upperdeck hot dog thaw those typing fingers out and tell us what you think the a s ought to do to keep this one from slipping away polanco lofts a 21 offspeed pitch to the left field corner that drops in for a double because of the defensive shift ordonez bounces weakly up the third base line , and doesn t run hard , thinking it s foul , but he s retired , no advance for poalnco one out man on second guillen lifts a fly to center that might have scored polanco had ordonez advanced him two out , man on second harden seems steadier , and is finding the zone more , letting the tigers put the ball in play he looks sharper he s also using more of his offspeed pitches and not relying on the fastball so much he strikes out rodriguez , side retired top of the third harden danced on the edge of a serious precipice there in the second but escaped without allowing a run can the a s turn the momentum now and get back in the game against rogers \? the contrast between starters seems to get starker by the batter , as rogers steadily gets his firstpitch strikes and induces one easy out after another kendall grounds to short one out kotsay strikes out looking at a 22 fastball in the middle of the zone the a s are going to start talking to themselves if this keeps up two out rogers gets ahead 02 on bradley , then tries a couple of balls away but bradley doesn t bite finally he strikes out swinging side retired rogers is cruising bottom of the second as david posts in our comments section , the crowd closeups look like a lions game , not a tigers game it s knit hats and parkas and hoodies as far as you can say is coffee outselling beer at comerica \? harden starts pudge rodriguez with a strike , and then breaks his bat as pudge lines softly to second one out harden starts infante with a strike as well , maybe the butterflies are settling down or not he gets behind 31 after a foul , infante watches ball four inge s medium grounder to short becomes a fielder s choice , as they get jimenez at second but not inge at first two out , man on first harden goes to 31 again , on santiago , who gets to swing on 31 and fouls off the pitch santiago gets a walk , too fox cuts to a clip of harden talking about growing up in canada , but nobody tells the booth granderson up with two and two out , and harden keeps missing he s thrown 40plus pitches already it s a fourpitch walk and the bases are loaded with two out young s out there again to settle his rookie starter harden gets ahead 02 on monroe , swinging but he misses wide and then throws one in the dirt monroe swings through the splitter , side retired top of the second rogers has a lead to work with now , and is quickly ahead 02 on chavez , who fouls off the first two pitches he flies the third pitch deep to center , but granderson runs it down in that outfield as big as the upper peninsula one out rogers throws with so much less velocity than harden that i thought for a minute fox had switched to slomo but rogers has his control so far , while harden has yet to get his in hand swisher works the count full and then fouls one off , maybe hoping to at least run the pitch count up a bit on rogers finally he draws a walk scutaro flies the first pitch to right man on first , two out rogers shows us his mlbbest pickoff move , but no soap the rally rags are fluttering in the crowd as rogers gets ahead of jimenez 12 rogers s curve seemed to jump up and away , and rogers looks at his hands trouble gripping the ball in the cold \? the fox commentators wonder about a little pine tar jimenez grounds weakly to the left side , side retired bottom of the first harden starts with a fourpitch walk to granderson uhoh a little nervous , ya think \? two of his pitches were in the dirt in front of the plate he s out there wearing short sleeves , too he starts monroe with three balls , and finally a strike monroe takes another strike to run the count full granderson takes off , monroe singles through the hole to right , and it s first and third , no out harden starts polanco with a strike but then misses twice insise , by enough to bend the batter out of the way poalnco singles to right , drives in granderson , monroe to third first and third and still no one out young , the a s pitching coach , is out to the mound to settle harden down ordonez grounds to short , they get the runner at second but monroe scores on the play first and third , one out harden is starting batters with strikes now , mainly fastballs guillen grounds to first , 363 double play , side retired harden sighs in relief top of the first and we re underway ! kendall starts things off with a 21 single to the left side of the infield rogers gets ahead of kotsay 12 , checks the runner at first kotsay pops up foul to left and brandon inge makes a great diving catch as he falls into the crowd the fans help him get back on the field quickly one out bradley flies the first pitch to left two out rogers quickly ahead 02 on thomas , then hits him in the thigh of his left leg , hbp first and second , two out , and once again rogers gets a firstpitch strike , swinging this time from payton payton grounds to inge , who steps on third to retire kendall unassisted , side retired lineups for the a s 1 jason kendall c 2 milt kotsay cf 3 milton bradley rf 4 frank thomas dh 5 jay payton cf 6 eric chavez 3b 7 nick swisher 1b 8 marco scutaro ss 9 d angelo jimenez 2b for the tigers 1 curtis granderson cf 2 craig monroe lf 3 placido polanco 2b 4 magglio ordonez rf 5 carlos guillen 1b 6 ivan rodriguez c 7 omar infante dh 8 brandon inge 3b 9 ramon santiago ss pregame good afternoon ! i m pat lyons and i m the rookie blogger taking the mound for the third game in the american league championship series this afternoon the wily veteran carla baranauckas is on hand to moderate your comments and keep me out of trouble , with jeffrey marcus and other bench help , so weigh in early and often a wily veteran figures to be a big part of the story line this afternoon , as kenny rogers takes the mound for detroit at home , and the situation looks oddly familiar , with the tigers once again up 20 as they give him the ball of course , winning this one won t eliminate the a s the way the last one did the yankees , but coming back from a 30 deficit is so hard that the stakes are almost as high today jack curry of the times wrote this morning about how rogers prepared mentally for that start against the yankees , when rogers came up huge can he do it again this afternoon \? or will the tigers have to turn to a bullpen that may be without joel zumaya and his 100plus heat \? another dominant story line is the weather it s crrrrrrrisp in comerica park this afternoon , with a sharp breeze and a threat of precip cold weather supposedly favors hitters by making it hard for the pitchers to stay loose and warm , but on a great lakes fall day like this , with temps in the low 40 s for the first pitch and maybe the 20 s after the sun sets , staying warm is going to be an issue for everyone on the field not to mention in the stands \( not here in cozy times square , though , where i have a beatup compaq and a 10inch tv to keep me warm \) for the athletics , looking up out of an 02 hole , the big question is what young rich harden brings to the park he last pitched to bigleague hitters nearly two weeks ago , on the final day of the regular season , when he struggled against the angels can he do what barry zito and esteban loaiza could not leash the tigers long enough for his teammates to win \? a s manager ken macha said yesterday that five zeroes from harden would do the trick we ll see tonight plenty to think about , plenty to watch as we get underway shortly after 4 30 pm eastern time
growing up grucci has its perks and perils , even after the grucci in question is all grown up take 56yearold felix j grucci jr , the involuntarily retired republican politician who served one term in congress before being ousted in 2002 by timothy h bishop , a neophyte democrat from the hamptons , in a vicious campaign characterized by mutual smearslinging is mr grucci nostalgic for congress , or for the six rollicking years he spent as supervisor of the town of brookhaven \? not exactly getting yourself elected to public office has gotten to be a blood sport , he says it s not enough to win today the opponent is out to destroy you , and destroy your family name , and i do n't want to say it s like what the mafia does to its enemies , but at the end of the day , it s not exactly not like what the mafia does nostalgic about the family business \? absolutely mr grucci , whose greatuncle tony renounced a hohum career as a greengrocer for a more swashbuckling gig peddling fireworks , has made a smooth return to pyromania from politics it s as if he never left , especially at this time of year the fourth of july is christmas for the fireworks industry , mr grucci says in his baronial office at frenzied fireworks by grucci , booked solid with 150 independence day displays nationwide as for local competitors like bay fireworks , which put a dent in grucci s municipal portfolio , mr grucci waxes cavalier saying grucci has competition from them is like saying i am a competitor of frank sinatra because we both sing we get the tune what does scare him is mother nature god forbid , he says , that it rains on , yes , umbrella beach in montauk or on eisenhower park , where there s to be a 100 , 000 grucci display choreographed to music or that infant piping plovers , the endangered birds that are the nemeses of east coast fireworks , are n't flightready to exit the island s beaches before the weekend festivities \( the west coast culprit is an endangered turtle \) mr grucci , who has a tattoo of a panther on his right bicep and of jesus on his left , is not sold on the plovers' sacrosanct status the environmentalists say they 're endangered , but we run into them everywhere , he said go figure oops do n't mention environmentalists mr grucci has had his share of headaches relating to them while he was brookhaven s supervisor , a plover sighting threatened to close the beach at davis park , on fire island mr grucci asked the united states fish and wildlife service what would happen if he did n't comply i was told i could be arrested and the town fined 10 , 000 a day , he said happily , the plovers nested elsewhere more serious were allegations , in a campaign advertisement for mr bishop , that fireworks by grucci polluted the groundwater here with perchlorate , a byproduct of fireworks manufacturing it was inadvertent , confined to a small area and cleaned up , mr grucci says , but the damage was done if you are perceived as being antienvironment , you do n't hold office very long out here , he says life is simpler , he adds , now that he is out of politics though the company s manufacturing plant is in virginia , its products are tested and tweaked right here on 90 forlorn acres of sand and scrub pines reached by a winding road to nowhere the sense of desolation is by design twice in the past , grucci plants have blown up the first in elmont in 1929 , a blast that killed two relatives the next in bellport in 1983 , the year grucci established itself as a fireworks worldbeater with its brooklyn bridge centennial that was in may on a saturday in november , the bellport plant exploded , killing mr grucci s brother , james , and a cousin had mr grucci not been running late , he might have perished , too it destroyed the family morale , he says of the accident but my sister and i decided we could n't leave the fireworks business and let that be the final chapter they rebuilt , but not in bellport there is a bit of a notinmybackyard attitude toward the grucci operation on long island here in brookhaven , there are no neighbors perfect for testing explosives ! of all sorts in the 1940 s , mr grucci s father , felix sr , began supplying the military with training explosives in 1994 , grucci received a 13 million contract to make simulated missiles for the army , and the relationship has continued for training troops in iraq , the company simulates trip mines and grenades for pleasing civilians on independence day , it serves up a different product i often say we 're the jackass of many trades and the master of none , mr grucci says just kidding his sister , donna , chimes in with a clarification grucci has the same philosophy , she says , as one of its highprofile customers , donald j trump there is no room for flaws in his world ours either as you leave grucci lane , the last signpost reads , have a safe show consider it a family reminder photo \( photo by fireworks by grucci \)

as the mets charged into this year s postseason , their cityskyline logo suddenly appeared on magazine covers , on pencils displayed near grocery checkouts and on bumper stickers sold at gasoline stations but just a few months ago and for many years before that , through thick and mostly thin there was hardly a trace of mets gear to be found my son james and i would trudge from store to store in search of a mets backpack or even just a lunch box , deliberately ignoring the racks and rows of yankee tank tops , change purses and dog sweaters last year , the manager of a large , local sports warehouse truly trying to help asked , have you considered rooting for the yankees \? james , who was 6 at the time , and i had a long , silent , thoughtful ride home even then , of course , metsemblazoned tchotchkes and memorabilia proliferated online and a few clicks did bring us the coveted backpack but seeing that favorite team s logo out in the world , as yankee fans always do , validates that loyalty , makes it seem meaningful and widespread , which is important for a child this year , of course , meaningfulness does n't need a logo but it does need a perspective as both james and i know , this thrilling season would never be so truly , so characteristically amazing without the struggles that preceded it and i do n't mean the team s struggles before he started first grade , james had already learned that it s tough to be a mets fan , especially in yankeeland here in south orange , nj , trickortreaters often resemble the yankees' starting lineup yankeesthemed parties , with the birthday boy in the derek jeter role , are not unusual our daughter s american girl doll wears a yankee uniform \( a promotional giveaway from a game she attended \) even our local history looks toward the bronx babe ruth and lou gehrig played an exhibition game here in 1929 now the town team wears shirts that say , south orange where legends played in big letters across the back ambitious batters , from tball firsttimers to college varsity veterans , aim at an apartment building on a town thoroughfare , hoping to break a window as legend says gehrig did still , we never wavered even as children , the fans i know accepted the mets as their destiny like being lefthanded , it s occasionally inconvenient , but it s a way of life for me , it s a familial trait i was raised national league by a mets father and a phillies mother when the family landed in northern new jersey , my brother and i gravitated toward shea stadium , where i learned to count change at the concession stand and to score a game correctly , filling in the spaces with satisfying k s when the opposing team s batter struck out my father took us to several seasons' worth of mets games , enough to establish a lifetime loyalty to the team even as their fortunes waxed and waned , and i lived in many places , i answered questions about team preference with , mets , of course if i had carried a backpack , i would have wanted a mets logo on it , which is why i 've been willing to travel hopefully from store to store each year , much as the mets approach those first road games each season the peculiar pull of this team is the repeated disappointment that punctuates its bigleague credentials i 've always seen myself in the players the way they blow opportunities , make spectacular errors and sometimes , just barely , catch a break they either do n't deserve or deserve more than any other team in the world that s baseball s equivalent of missed deadlines , bills paid late , children s homework hastily done and the occasional glorious day when either none of that matters or all of it does on the best of good days , i'm willie randolph , my children are a welltrained team , and my suburb is a soldout night game at shea more often , my met life is a rainout followed by a grueling doubleheader on the road and bad news about the pitcher s throwing arm my high school buddy , a queens transplant , and i used to listen to mets games on a transistor radio in his yard when his mother sent us outside to weed the vegetable garden i remember lying in spring s damp grass , which dried to nothing in the heat of late summer and revived for the playoffs even then , back in the 1980 s , it was an apt metaphor for the mets' seasons this year , for the first time in recent memory , i look forward to reading the sports pages after the mets swept the division title , their logo swept the stores with equal bravado , often replacing large yankee displays entire windows of sportinggoods stores in new york city are now filled with mets gear mets tshirts are being advertised in south orange advertised ! at several stores , along with enough backpacks for every child in the tristate area i see myself less clearly in this success story , but that s ok if my mets have a golden season , there s reason to think that i 'll have the same so i'm feeling an unfamiliar exuberance in gleeful anticipation of dare i say it \? a world series title , i decide to buy some party clothes , a new tshirt for myself and a hat for james as a veteran fan , though , my exuberance is tempered , just slightly , by experience browsing through the array of mets gear , i choose a backpack that i hide from james it s for next year just in case we 're all disappointed and it s back to the same old and the mets logo vanishes from sight like a foul ball into a fan s mitt because being a mets fan means celebrating victories a stolen base , a favorable call at third or a division title when we can , and pragmatically planning for errors it s the lesson of the legacy it s the hardwon wisdom that distinguishes us from fans of that other new york team it sets us apart well , that and the backpacks drawing \( drawing by alex nabaum \)
it s a quintessential long island mess , and it s heating up fast the battle over rapid uncoordinated commercial development in what has come to be known as the sagtikos corridor , and the colossal traffic snarls that critics say are bound to follow the corridor is a sixsquaremile area just west of the sagtikos parkway where the borders of smithtown , huntington , babylon and islip come together already , three major development projects are moving ahead in the area , with more on the drawing board all dependent on the same handful of truck roads and exit ramps fearful of being swamped with new car and truck traffic on commack road , crooked hill road and connecting streets , residents of the area are complaining loudly to elected officials that they were given no warning or opportunity to object to projects that will affect them , but that happen to fall on the other side of a town line from their homes in response , the supervisors of the four towns , county legislators from the area and the suffolk county executive , steve levy , met last week to discuss ideas for jointly easing potential traffic congestion in the corridor but some community groups say the effort is too little too late some of these projects should never have seen the light of day , said laura mansi , president of the four towns civic association the county failed us while they do n't have zoning power over the townships , the department of public works , which is supposed to control safety , failed to do that now everyone is coming to the table late one of the projects a bigbox retail center including walmart and kohl s stores is already being built between crooked hill road and the parkway , north of the long island expressway in smithtown another a 180store tanger outlet center south of the expressway in deer park won zoning approval from the town of babylon last week and the biggest , a plan for shops , offices and as many as 9 , 000 apartments on part of the pilgrim psychiatric center grounds in brentwood is being reviewed by the town of islip none of the towns have any formal say in what the others approve the parts of huntington near the corridor are residential , and much of the local opposition is centered there irene blaymore , president of the new imperial gardens community association in dix hills , says she is worried that commack road , which runs along the huntingtonsmithtown town line and is already heavily used , will become a catastrophic logjam of traffic once the three projects are completed ms blaymore , a 20year dix hills resident who lives about 500 feet from the smithtown line and the bigbox center , said her group began as a neighborhood watch but is now focused on fighting overdevelopment at the meeting with legislators and town supervisors , mr levy proposed a twoprong approach to the traffic problem he called for planners in the four towns to look for shortterm improvements like extending turn lanes and reconfiguring intersections that the towns can do immediately , while also lobbying the state government to build a new truck route parallel to the sagtikos parkway to ease the load on commack road and deer park avenue planning commissioners from the four towns are expected to follow up with another meeting on the corridor later this month the proposed truck road , which would serve all three projects and connect with long island avenue at the south end of the corridor near the outlet center , may take up to nine years to design and build , mr levy said supervisor steven bellone of babylon said in an interview that he supports the outlet center , which is scheduled to break ground in the summer , even though it will put more cars on the road in the town the project , he said , would enhance our tax base and lessen the burden on taxpayers huntington residents complain that they will suffer many of the headaches from the new bigbox center , including spillover traffic , increased crime and noise and reduced property values , but will reap none of the benefits because the property taxes collected on the center will go to smithtown supervisor frank petrone of huntington said that the recent meeting speaks highly of what regional planning is , but that town and county officials should have started discussing development in the area years ago the county should have taken a larger role in the process , mr petrone said we have the authority for zoning in the towns , but the only way to resolve major problems is if you join forces commack road and crooked hill road are county highways , and the county has authority to control curb cuts driveways and entrances to private property along the roads but some civic groups contend that the county failed to think through the projects' cumulative impact on congestion and safety before giving curbcut approvals others go further , demanding that the county find a way to override town permits and halt the projects critics do n't understand that zoning powers are exclusively within the town s jurisdiction , mr levy said the county makes recommendations to the town , but it cannot force the town to accept or deny a zoning application state law does n't give us the authority to shut down a town project he said that the county planning department , which reviews projects within 500 feet of a town border , opposed both the outlet center and the bigbox center last year , saying their sites would be better suited to apartment complexes or light industry eric alexander , executive director of vision long island , a group that advocates carefully planned growth and development , said he did not think the county could accomplish much in the short term to alleviate traffic unplanned development , which is what this is , leads to excess congestion , mr alexander said individual government bodies , he added , should not do their planning in isolation this is a lesson to other townships that they should work

the morning constitutional that jerry stabile likes to take while his wife is at 8 30 mass at st henry s used to take him straight down broadway , the central artery in his hometown , bayonne lately , though , it has taken him to a place he has n't been since he was a boy right there , he said , gesturing toward the finger of tidal water that separates the new river walk along the edge of constable hook from the abandoned military base on the next peninsula to the north there was the hulk of a ship sunk in the mud , a steel hulk , and we used to swim off of it the hulk is long gone , but maybe a halfmile north in the gray distance , framed by dockside cranes and blocky warehouses , was a vision of the tropics a gleaming white cruise ship , the explorer of the seas , that had just docked in an unlikely industrial neighborhood nobody ever came down here before , said mr stabile , who has spent almost all of his 76 years in hudson county born and bred at 44th street and avenue b in bayonne , he was a longtime funeral home owner in jersey city before retiring in 1985 and moving back to bayonne , a city of 62 , 000 that is still dominated by irish , italian and polish catholics just who should be joining him here on the waterfront in the years ahead was the central question of a close mayoral race this month a race that came to be seen as a referendum on the future of that peninsula across the way the waterfront is where bayonne has always earned its wages where john d rockefeller built the oil refinery that defined the city , where the army shipped out its tanks and jeeps to overseas wars from a twomilelong stretch of landfill that juts out toward the statue of liberty but when the military ocean terminal closed in 1999 , the city got a 430acre tract almost the size of hoboken and a ticket in the gold coast lottery the continuing reclamation of the ramshackle mudflats of new jersey s hudson river shoreline film and television crews came to the old base first , building sets in the vast warehouses war of the worlds in building 74 , hbo s oz in building 73 the cruise ships followed , dropping off tanned passengers on a barren spit of land that lacked the oldnewsreel glamour of the west side docks of manhattan , but that was easy to drive to and had plenty of parking more cruise ships were on the horizon , along with town houses , apartments , stores , offices , hotels , parks , some light industry and warehouses an ambitious redevelopment plan championed by mayor joseph v doria jr , a twoterm incumbent and also a state senator then former judge patrick d conaghan of municipal court started talking about a container port on the peninsula , and tapping into some quiet ambivalence about a future that looks so much different from the past received enough votes in the mayoral election on may 9 to force a runoff last week on tuesday , mr doria was returned to office with 53 percent of the vote , to mr conaghan s 47 percent mr stabile stopped for a moment at a bench along the river walk and watched the steady stream of buses shuttling cruise passengers off the peninsula which is not open to the general public yet and taking explorer crew members on liberty into bayonne a couple of weeks earlier , the world s largest passenger ship , the freedom of the seas , had visited on its inaugural cruise , and mr stabile had been one spectator among many who came to the river walk , the best publicly accessible view , to get a glimpse the explorer is n't much smaller , just about the size of the chrysler building tipped on its side , but it arrived with no ceremony and no audience , just another 138 , 000ton visitor bearing an ice rink , a casino , a shopping arcade and 3 , 100 passengers coming home from a fiveday jaunt to bermuda three thousand go out , three thousand come in it s a routine now , said jasmine hammond , who spent 30 years working for the defense department here and still gets misty when remembering the flag retirement ceremony at the base s closing she is now the property manager , and institutional memory , for the bayonne local redevelopment authority , and when the ships come in , her office window is almost entirely filled by their cityblock bulk before she arrived for work that day , before jerry stabile started his walk , the explorer had slipped under the verrazano narrows bridge and then slowly spun around and backed into bayonne as carefully as a teenager learning to parallel park , finally facing out toward the water , as the city itself has begun to do that s quite a ship , mr stabile said as he got up from the bench he is a cruise veteran himself , having logged a total of 625 days at sea with his wife on trips across half the world , but none yet from the port near the end of his street i prefer a smaller ship myself photo \( photo by don emert agence francepress getty images \)
no selborne journal today gilbert white made no entry for 2 march 1759 , and on this day in 1784 the year we have been tracking he was in south lambeth visiting his brother new entry tomorrow 2 30 pm 25 degrees light snow on a dim day our land is bounded by fences and by a gravel road and a state highway we have subdivided it further into several zones four pastures , none of them very big , two gardens , a poultry yard , and a horse pen some places are harder to define one we call simply north of the barn a very different place from the barnyard one we think of as that triangular spot behind the garden near the big gate a patch of ground we always imagine being flatter and bigger than it is over time we have built up a vocabulary for our place that is a little elusive it reflects the shifting use we make of various spots that area north of the barn , for instance , was where we parked the horsetrailer last spring , when we used it as a brooderhouse for ducklings and goslings this fall it was where cheryl and suzanne , the tamworth gilts , lived these places are all defined by static boundaries but there is another boundary to our property that is less static that is the crowns of the trees that ring the pastures in summer , this is a dense , massive barrier , its opacity almost unimaginable this time of year , when the high limbs and branches seem woven together in a loose , overlapping fence the keepers of this border the guards of wildness are the crows they rest high in the treetops like black beacons what strikes me is the crows ability to define , somehow , the limits of my perception so many other birds here crowd into our field of view chickadees , of course , like a persistent , nagging thought , and doves and finches and juncoes and even bluebirds , lining up , in their passage , to drink from the eavestrough a redtailed hawk soaring overhead almost out of sight lets its cry fall , and hearing it , i look up to see where it has fallen from and yet i never look to see where the clattering and racheting and crackling of the crows is coming from i know sometimes they are in the top of a dying sugar maple in the barnyard pasture sometimes they have lined up along the top of the poultryyard fence they are always here , utterly familiar and completely unknown it s as though they keep a constant distance from me that s what i mean about defining the limits of my perception i have the sense that they roost at the edge of what i notice , sometimes looking into the circle of my observations , sometimes looking outward and well beyond while i was thinking about our crows , i began to remember the way they flocked around the small iowa town where i grew up just beyond the edge of town there was a cemetery , a small creek , and a railroad trestle farther off in the distance this was where my friends and i sometimes went to pretend that we were anywhere but where we really were and here too , i remember sensing the sly , careful watchfulness of the crows always visible but always just beyond the reach of any harm we might do i seem to remember my dad telling me , as i was learning how to hunt , about the way crows understood the range of a shotgun compared to them a pheasant seemed like a lumbering , panicky creature , a sort of sheep with wings i never hunted crows i believe they would have hunted me back there is an endless mythology about crows , much of it summed up in a book called in the company of crows and ravens by john m marzluff and tony angell humans make myths out of what is true , out of what we fear , out of what we wish but we also make myths every time we encounter intelligence in the natural world the way we react to the obvious intelligence of crows , for instance , suggests that we are fundamentally puzzled by our own intelligence by intelligence itself we simply do not know what it means to be cognizant of the world around us we do everything we can to limit it , to border it , to blunt our perceptions somedays it seems to me that the crows are here crooking their heads from side to side to remind us of that
melky cabrera s confidence is written in red and blue ink on his right shoulder blade it was there , five months ago , that cabrera had a tattoo artist draw a major league baseball logo at the time , cabrera had played in only six games , none very well somehow , he must have known there was more to come cabrera is not supposed to be playing for the yankees now , but there he was in the ninth inning at shea stadium yesterday , down two strikes to the mets' star closer , billy wagner cabrera fouled off three pitches in a row and eventually drew a walk on the 11th pitch of a decidedly major league atbat wagner fell apart after that , and the yankees went on to tie the score they won , 54 , when andy phillips lined a single to center that drove in the goahead run in the 11th inning and mariano rivera struck out the side to end the game it was not a classic the teams combined for seven errors , the most in a game between them but for the second game in a row , the winning team overcame a fourrun deficit the patchwork yankees prevailed this time , with lesser names leading the way melky s atbat was tremendous in the ninth inning , and to have andy come in there in the last inning and get that hit , that was a big deal , said the yankees' mike mussina , who allowed two earned runs in seven innings it makes those guys feel better about their situation and makes joe have more confidence in them joe torre , the yankees' manager , has little choice he could trust in cabrera , phillips and the rest , or dwell on his missing veterans hideki matsui and gary sheffield are on the disabled list , and jorge posada and bernie williams did not start yesterday because of minor injuries when you have these guys eligible for you , torre said , they are the best players in the world of course , mets manager willie randolph could say that with more certainty , considering his starter yesterday it was pedro mart \? z , who seems to have buried his previous futility against the yankees in seven innings , mart \? z allowed four singles , one walk and no runs , striking out eight pedro knows how to pitch , said johnny damon , his former red sox teammate he might be tougher now , cutting the ball and sinking it i 'll tip my hat to him one of the greatest pitchers of all time mart \? z has 202 career victories to rank seventh on the active list , three spots behind mussina , who has 230 mussina was not mart \? z s equal yesterday , but he settled down after doubles by carlos beltr \? and david wright knocked in two runs in the first in the fourth inning , carlos delgado drove a pitch several inches off the plate over the fence in leftcenter for his 14th home run in the seventh , cliff floyd pulled a changeup over the wall in rightcenter for his fourth home run the mets led , 40 , and mart \? z was done after 102 pitches , having struck out kelly stinnett with two on to end the top of the seventh inning duaner s \? hez worked a quick eighth , and randolph called for wagner in the ninth it was not a save situation , and the same yankees hitters had just seen wagner on friday i did n't think pedro would come out , the way he was throwing and with his pitch count pretty low , mussina said it was pretty easy for him and i was surprised when wagner came back with a fourrun lead , and he just pitched last night but , of course , you do n't expect a closer of his caliber to pitch like that strange things happen before yesterday , lefthanders were batting 059 against wagner but two yankees lefties , jason giambi and robinson can \? ad hits in the ninth giambi had been 2 for 31 before his leadoff single , and after alex rodriguez walked , can \? single made the score 41 miguel cairo flied out to bring up cabrera , who had singled against mart \? z in his previous atbat from where he stood , rodriguez said he admired cabrera s approach that was awesome , against a closer like that , to get up there and be 02 and battle back , battle back , rodriguez said i was at second base , and he laid off some pitches that are very hard to lay off he fouled off some great sliders down and in stinnett was the next hitter , and he said cabrera s walk seemed to unnerve wagner , who had struck out the side friday stinnett was the final out of that game , but this time wagner walked him on four pitches to cut the mets' lead to 42 stinnett said he helped wagner on friday by swinging at pitches out of the strike zone the yankees tried to make him work more this time , and wagner said he noticed the difference i thought they 'd be a lot more aggressive , he said , and they were patient williams batted next as a pinchhitter , and wagner hit him with his first pitch , forcing in another run to make the score 43 the lefthander pedro feliciano came in to face the lefthandedhitting damon , who grounded to shortstop jos \? eyes that was the last place he wanted to hit it , damon said , and he thought he would surely be out at first on a gameending double play what was going through his mind \? just run 'run , forrest , run ! ' damon said , quoting a line from the film forrest gump i was running i told you i could run when i need to it s just the slowingdown part damon has a chipped bone in his right foot , and he might have been hurting when he slowed down , but he was also thrilled the score was tied , 44 , and when jorge julio walked cairo to lead off the 11th , the yankees capitalized cairo stole second and third as cabrera and stinnett struck out up came phillips , who had come in for defense in the 10th and was batting 174 in a limited role i just have n't swung the bat well since i 've been here , regardless of how many atbats i 've had , phillips said but i do have confidence in myself at the plate confidence was a theme for the yankees yesterday , and it was well placed this time phillips lashed a single to center , julio waved his arms in dismay , and after a dominant inning by rivera , the yankees sneaked away with a victory photos andy phillips , center , who delivered the winning hit , being congratulated by his teammates after the final out closer billy wagner was charged with four earned runs in the ninth inning as the mets squandered a 40 lead \( photographs by robert caplin for the new york times \) \( pg 1 \) andy phillips s twoout single in the 11th off jorge julio drove in miguel cairo with the winning run cairo had walked and stolen two bases there was a mixed reaction from the shea stadium crowd yesterday when the yankees tied the score on a fielder s choice by johnny damon \( photographs by robert caplin for the new york times \) \( pg 2 \)
for their annual fundraiser , the athletic boosters at centerville high in suburban dayton , ohio , recently raffled off two tickets to a nfl game normally , that would be considered sweetening the pot with an artificial substance , there being no real substitute in these parts for football as it is played in high schools or at nearby ohio state this year is the rarest of exceptions people who do not follow the nfl were giddy at the prospect of procuring tickets for the jets' game this weekend against the packers in green bay , wis the reason was threefold mike nugent and nick mangold of the jets , and a j hawk of the packers grew up in centerville nugent , a secondyear placekicker , is coming off a four fieldgoal performance against the houston texans that included a careerbest 54yarder mangold , a rookie , has started all 11 games at center while accruing only two penalties hawk , a rookie linebacker , was credited with 15 tackles \( 10 unassisted \) in the packers' loss at seattle on monday night for local residents , seeing three of centerville s own in the nfl seems no less preposterous than striking oil in their backyards the city of 23 , 000 is known more for its early stone buildings than for its professional football pipeline the bedroom community is the opposite of sprawling , its tightknit constitution reflected in half of its businesses , which employ five or fewer people before nugent was drafted by the jets in the second round last year , centerville had produced two nfl players and none since andy harmon , a defensive tackle who played for the philadelphia eagles from 1991 to 1997 we 're a very little town , said mangold s father , vern to have three kids playing in the nfl is unreal to have players from centerville squaring off in an nfl game is also a little unnerving picking sides is like having to choose among communal flesh and blood for rick amos , a retired chief master sergeant of the air force , the question of whom to pull for is further complicated amos , who lives in a neighboring town , bellbrook , bought one 5 raffle ticket in the fundraiser and won airfare for two , lodging , a car rental and tickets to the game at lambeau field amos , 53 , does not know any of the centerville players , though he says he feels a tenuous connection to nugent , who signed a visor last year for his 16yearold daughter , katherine but the raffle tickets were donated by hawk , the fifth overall pick in this year s draft , and amos is supposed to meet him after the game so whose colors does he wear \? i am somewhat conflicted , amos said in a telephone interview it s probably not a good idea to be wearing a mike nugent jersey when i meet a j then again , amos cannot in good conscience show up in a hawk jersey after how gracious nugent was to his daughter , whom amos is taking to the game maybe i 'll wear a woody hayes buckeyes hat , amos said , laughing , referring to the legendary former coach of ohio state , which hawk , nugent and mangold attended that s kind of neutral hawk was the first to be pegged for greatness he was a year behind nugent in school , but because of his athletic abilities , he often played up in age it was kind of a big thing around centerville , how good a j was in the sixth grade , mangold said this week he was a lot better than me or mike there was no question about that he was a beast back in the day still is nugent s father , dan , who played football at the university of wisconsin and the university of dayton , said in sixthgrade football , there s ambulances on the field taking off people because of a j he crushed people at cardboard heroes , a sports store at the dayton mall , hawk s reputation for humility and hard work render him much more than a onedimensional star to the shoppers who have made his no 50 packers jersey one of the topselling items it sells better than the jersey of bengals receiver chad johnson and is on par with that of steelers quarterback ben roethlisberger , who played his college ball at nearby miami of ohio nugent was the only nfl kicker whose jersey was stocked at the store until this year , when the colts signed adam vinatieri , prompting some demand for his jersey nuge s jersey sold just as good as anybody else , said eric hillaker , a store employee who said he was four years behind nugent at centerville high hawk and nugent have known each other since they played on the centerville wee elks football team they were teammates at centerville high , then at ohio state centerville s principal , eileen booher , said , the best compliment you can give mike and a j is that they have n't changed at all after attending the same parochial grade school as nugent and hawk , mangold veered slightly off the beaten path he starred at bishop alter high , a 700student catholic school in nearby kettering , before arriving in columbus in the same class as hawk hawk and mangold roomed together for four years at ohio state , and both were named captains , as was nugent mangold says hawk is so shy , he communicates mostly through text messages i think it took two years of us living together to actually talk to each other , mangold said their last three years in columbus , hawk and mangold lived in a threebedroom house with another childhood friend , jonathan thomas
on sept 11 , 2001 , i was a lieutenant in the port authority police department after the attack , i became the night commander of the rescue and recovery operation at ground zero , charged with recovering the remains of my fellow officers and the thousands of other victims of the world trade center collapse i and the 30 to 50 officers under my command worked at ground zero six or seven days a week for more than eight months among the twomillionton mountain of shattered concrete , twisted steel and human remains pulling 19 , 000 body parts out of the rubble , we became accustomed to matching arms and legs like pairs of socks when we got home , we still smelled like ground zero , with bittertasting dust and an odor of decay in our hair and on our skin i could n't hug my wife and children until after i had taken several showers after two months on the job , i began to have sinus infections , headaches and eye irritations i was physically and mentally exhausted almost a year later , i developed a nerve weakness in my neck , back and shoulder that left my right arm nearly powerless besides my physical ailments , i felt isolated and disconnected from my family and alienated from my friends now , five years later , i have had to come to grips with the fact that my health and my future are at best uncertain and i am one of the lucky ones every day i speak with men who worked with me at the site i listen to them talk about suicide and i watch them go through the motions of life as shadows of the men they once were just last month , we buried one of those guys , a decorated port authority police officer , a husband and a father , who jumped off the george washington bridge because he could no longer cope with the loss of friends and colleagues , survivor s guilt , alienation and the frustration of being unable to help other workers who were also suffering since the rescue and recovery mission at ground zero ended in may 2002 , i know of at least half a dozen suicides while government officials have recently begun to take notice of the physical ailments suffered by the 9 11 responders and recovery workers , stress disorders and emotional disturbances are still being denied and yet , most doctors will tell you that physical pain is worsened by a public denial of its existence , increasing the isolation , which is the root cause of suicide port authority officers with 25 years of experience tell me that they ca n't recall a time when they have seen so many of their comrades committing or attempting to commit suicide psychiatric disorders often require years of treatment the 52 million that the federal government has budgeted for treatment of physical ailments and the 3 million that it has set aside for mental health treatment is simply not enough , especially when you 're talking about the unknown thousands of people who may have been affected in some way as a result of their work in rescue and recovery at ground zero starting the recovery mission changed us ending it changed us again none of that was ever properly addressed when we left the site many of us were taken to a hotel in new york s rockland county for a debriefing the intention was admirable but the result was woefully inadequate i had completed more than 220 tours of duty , or roughly 3 , 000 hours , at ground zero , and i was interviewed by a volunteer for a private organization who had less than 16 hours of training and who had never even been to the site it does n't matter who is to blame for the past what matters is who is accountable for the present the american medical establishment must acknowledge that responders and recovery workers are suffering physically and mentally and federal , state and local officials must provide free medical and mentalhealth screening for everyone who worked at ground zero , as well as individual and family counseling , if needed furthermore , the federal emergency management agency should create a medical databank for all workers involved in largescale disasters , like 9 11 or hurricane katrina this databank would contain blood and tissue samples taken regularly to establish the physical health of the workers before , during and after their duties it would also provide individual and group baseline statistical data for research purposes and finally , a coalition of federal and state officials must establish an independent commission for responders and recovery workers similar to the 9 11 victim compensation fund , a nofault alternative to tort litigation that provided compensation to individuals who were injured or killed and eliminated almost all lawsuits against public and private entities the site commanders at ground zero fought the first part of the battle the cleanup without a single fatality or lifethreatening injury to a worker the fact remains that we have lost more workers since the ground zero cleanup than during , and that is simply unacceptable we ca n't afford to lose any more
it has long been something of a quirk in the grim universe of diabetes a small number of pregnant women would become temporarily diabetic with proper care , the consequences were often thought to be mild the babies were usually healthy and the condition would vanish after the delivery , like a cough or a headache but , not unlike the wider expansion of diabetes , this disorder is now growing , and indications are that it is growing fast in new york , socalled gestational diabetes has risen by nearly 50 percent in about 10 years there is also broader recognition that in the lives of many pregnant women , the arrival of the condition is significant and its impact can be grave not only does it identify those women at particularly high risk to develop permanent diabetes , but it may contribute to their babies' eventually getting diabetes as well health care officials worry that insufficient attention is being paid to the rising number of cases , apparently being propelled by genetically susceptible women entering pregnancy too fat the inattention , the officials say , is allowing young mothers to be saddled with a harrowing lifelong disease and increasing the risk to their children of ultimately sharing that troubling destiny it is hard to say just how alarming this will become but those who study the diabetes epidemic are concerned that it s one more time bomb it s really disturbing to us that women come into their pregnancies obese and then leave them even more obese , said barbara hackley , a certified nursemidwife at the health center of the children s health fund and montefiore medical center in the south bronx i 've seen weight gains during pregnancies of 50 to 60 pounds we 've had 11 and 12pound babies that are very dangerous to deliver gestational diabetes , like other forms of diabetes , is characterized by dangerously high levels of sugar in the blood many women who develop it have never even heard of the disorder afterward , they never think much about it , unless visited by its potential legacy , type 2 diabetes , a progressive , potentially fatal illness that can produce a barrage of complications , from strokes to decaying limbs in 2001 , the latest year researchers have studied , there were 4 , 200 cases of gestational diabetes in new york among women who gave birth to a single baby experts believe wider education about the condition might allow some heavy women , through better diet and exercise , to avert it before they become pregnant furthermore , experts say , many mothers are inadequately counseled after delivery by busy clinicians or are unable to absorb the message about the need to monitor their weight and blood sugar , as well as their child s , because of the danger of chronic diabetes a surprising number , doctors say , never even bother to confirm that the gestational diabetes went away take the weight narrative of andrea reyes at 21 , pregnant with her first child , she weighed 153 pounds she tacked on just seven pounds during the pregnancy , because the baby came early but instead of shedding her baby fat , she said , i ate the same food but i ate more four years later , pregnant with her second child , she weighed 190 during her pregnancy , doctors found that she had gestational diabetes , which usually shows up 24 to 28 weeks into pregnancy she had no idea what it was the baby was fine , and the diabetes disappeared , but it was resurrected during her third pregnancy , in 2001 she weighed 193 her son was large 9 pounds , 9 ounces and had low blood sugar , complications of the condition again , the diabetes subsided but her doctor cautioned her that if she did not diet and exercise , she might acquire permanent type 2 diabetes in may 2004 , after fitful progress , that s what happened she is now 32 , a sprightly woman with dark hair knotted in a ponytail who lives in the south bronx and peddles fruit salads in the summers she takes pills and insulin , and sometimes finds herself dizzy though she winnowed her weight down to 180 , she has put on five pounds in the past month i know , ms reyes said sheepishly , too much her doctors have advised her that she needs to keep an eye on her son , whose weight is now normal i know , she said i worry the dimensions of gestational diabetes are imprecise , and there is considerable disagreement about how vigorously to treat it , especially milder cases , and how much difference treatment makes the disorder is not tracked regularly in the city or nation estimates are rooted in scattered studies in its first attempt to measure the problem , the new york city department of health and mental hygiene , in a paper last september in the american journal of public health , said that a review of births between 1990 and 2001 found that the prevalence had leapt to 38 percent , or about 4 , 200 pregnant women in 2001 , from 26 percent there was a pronounced increase among younger women and asians , who tend to get diabetes at lower weights with south and central asian mothers , prevalence hit 111 percent , one of the highest documented levels in the country an increase of more than 75 percent occurred among women delivering before age 35 although the study did not track the weights of mothers , it concluded that obesity was probably the principal force because it has been driving increases in type 2 diabetes

we 've lost our power where i live , there is nothing spiritual , psychological or political about these words they are dire , referring to a physical circumstance they mean that a utility pole or tree has fallen somewhere , wires are down , and the house has no electricity tropical storm ernesto in september was the cause of our most recent power failure , and while it lasted a mere 13 hours , shorter , more spontaneous power failures that seem to occur in the absence of any weatherrelated event have become routine in our area as well there is something about a house without power it has no hum , none of the soft background noises of the furnace , pump or refrigerator , none of the chirping of the computer , phone and fax that subtly reassure you that life is going on a silence and stillness , an invasive quiet , or maybe disquiet , settles in and with it comes uncertainty , because when the power is to be restored is as unpredictable as when it may go later , sometimes much later , comes that slightly magical moment when the house springs back to life , lights on , all the appliances resuming their improvisational rondeau part of the relief of coming through a blackout lies in knowing we have just endured an excursion to some province of uncertainty in his essay selfreliance , ralph waldo emerson observes that with consistency a great soul has simply nothing to do while i lay no claims for my soul , i know that a blackout is a genuine cure for consistency routines are upended , schedules are thwarted , work remains undone still , we manage to manage , bearing out another of emerson s assertions , which is that we thrive by casualties but whether our casualty lasts for three minutes , three hours or three days , it still always raises the question of whether to get a generator so far , we have n't not that we do n't think about it with winter upon us , i leaf through homeequipment magazines and tool catalogs and review my options with the obsessive fascination of paris hilton eyeing the runway during fashion week smart homeowner magazine assures me that power failures lasting more than 24 hours have tripled in this country since 1978 , presumably on account of our ravenous energy consumption and wornout infrastructure and i learned from a phone call to the new york state public service commission that while the frequency of power failures in the state has leveled off in the last five years , their duration has increased the web site for a manufacturer of generators went so far as to track the path of hurricane florence churning its way up the atlantic , all but promising me a blackout in my immediate future generators fall into two categories , standby and portable , the chief difference being that the first comes on automatically within seconds of a power failure while the other needs to be switched on manually standbys are generally installed permanently on concrete pads outdoors , while portables are just that \( all of them , though , must be operated outside , as they produce carbon monoxide fumes \) my head is turned by a standby liquidcooled number that runs on natural gas and has something called an ultraquiet whisper test feature , but its price tag of close to 8 , 000 seems extravagant , and i know i could get by just as well with a lowrent option priced under 1 , 000 with a sixgallon fuel tank , it provides continuous power for 10 or 12 hours if the power failure lasts longer , you can just refuel the one i would probably settle for lies somewhere in between , a portable unit with a 16gallon fuel tank that costs 2 , 000 there is something reassuring about knowing that it can generate electricity for a full 24 hours without refueling there is no such thing as too much power , says its ad copy , underscoring its dependability and like anyone newly infatuated , i reconsider my future , in which our old clapboard farmhouse becomes some epicenter of power and productivity yet for all the lust i try to summon up for one of these , no one i know who has a generator loves it all that much for all the security it offers , it s a piece of equipment that seems to elicit nothing so much as ambivalence it is an essential evil , says anne kreamer , a former neighbor of mine in dutchess county who bought a generator for her house there its smell , fumes and noise are all loathsome

the bagger has stared down the more than four long weeks to oscar night and decided that he will do his best not to sow mischief , mayhem or confusion , although it looks like this month will carry all of the suspense of the second half of the super bowl , with little new data and not much of the way of news the bagger is bad at math and an arriviste at oscar analytics , but he knows a few basic facts the movie that has the most oscar nominations usually wins \( except when it doesn t , like last year when the aviator s 11 nominations were no help when it came to best picture , as it took one on the chin from million dollar baby , which only had 7 \) brokeback mountain has the most nominations this year at 8 , including important categories like best picture , director , actor , supporting actor and actress , adapted screenplay , cinematography and score but something sort of jumps out at the bagger where is film editing , usually something of a buddy movie with best picture \? after some time stumbling around in the oscar database , the bagger got to wondering when was the last time that a best picture winner won without a nomination in the filmediting category \? why , that would be 25 years ago , when ordinary people took the cake without being nominated by the folks that splice or whatever they do now , the bagger is such a luddite the images to make them sing hmmmmmmmm oh , never mind brokeback has favorite written all over it , right \? start with director ang lee , a guy who not only makes great movies , but loves great movies , including the ones he is competing against the industry has no better spokesman in any language he is humble and ambitious , gracious and challenging , foreign and familiar and deserving don t forget deserving brokeback has hardware in its saddlebags from the golden globes , the producers and directors guilds , and the new york and la film critics factor in brilliant marketing for the film by david brooks at focus he learned a thing or two at miramax , no \? and its lock on the ultimate prize in filmmaking grows stronger add in a pair of handsome , wellspoken stars give or take heath ledger s snickering tourette s at the screen actors guild awards and what else do you want \? social relevance \? check grand visuals \? you bet box office \? it s getting there brokeback s business has grown nicely since the nominations were announced so everything is as it should be in leaderland the film editor snub is just one clank in an otherwise seamless bid , to be sure then again , while the bagger is pledged to maintain decorum , he just has to wonder whether the lack of a film editing nomination is an indication of underlying softness among the technical guilds the sound editors and mixers , the visual effects folks , etc now those guilds are something of a testosterone fest if you get the bagger s drift , more male than your average lakers crowd could it be that they see brokeback as a chick flick , something they will see if they have to on a date , but wouldn t be caught dead in with another guy \? can the average male love a movie about a little man love \? the bagger can , but then he s very in touch with his androgynous spirit so , anyway , the crafts were all over the place in nominations , right \? their big favorite was memoirs of a geisha , a huge chick flick which isn t even in the hunt , and king kong , which went flying off a cliff and landed with four nominations oh , and walk the line , which captured film editing and sound mixing nods on its way to five nominations the crafts have been hacking their own path oscarwise for a while , so the divergence is really a natural one still , the editing branch is huge , and even historical wild cards like life is beautiful and the crying game , which came out of nowhere to get best picture nominations , had the support of the film editors let s assume , only for the sake of argument and not hijinks of course , that there is a thinness to the support for the presumptive favorite who might be able to push it from behind while the ballots are out \? one of the things that makes crash the tiniest little threat is not only are there all those dvd s out there , but the bagger knows from personal experience that this parable of race scans just fine on the small screen it is going to get some serious second looks from academy members not so for brokeback , whose watery metaphors benefit from a more monumental presentation the problem with crash , and it is a significant one , is who will carry the banner of this ensemble wonder \? don cheadle \? great choice , much to commend , except well , he wasn t nominated the director paul haggis can do his share he kept the production of his movie local , spread the work around town , and has an excellent reputation but the best marketers around oscar time are usually famous faces that leaves matt dillon , who is a legit if longshot contender in the supporting category who performed a role people have no trouble remembering two problems there matt and dillon to say that mr dillon does not enjoy unalloyed moments with the press is , ah , putting it nicely he not only doesn t like them , he s not good at them and it shows i do not know mr dillon , but have seen him up close a few times and i got the impression he would rather have tea at chateau marmont with a table full of raging pit bulls than sit through a tender q a with reporters capote , then \? well , perhaps more people have seen the bagger s endless slideshow of his trip to maine last summer than have seen this fine film the boys at sony classics are now going wide with this baby there are tv ads and everything but there is going to have to be some significant build for the movie to be anything other than an arthouse flick that hit the academy bull s eye good night , and good luck has its supporters st george did a movie that scans as the people s work in the context of contemporary events he put his mouth and money behind something that looked like a long shot , but who is going to spend major dollars to get this gorgeous , conceptually brilliant movie into the race \? that leaves munich , and if there were a need for a lesson in steven spielberg s enduring influence and popularity in the industry , it arrived last tuesday the nominations shut up the oscar wonks and naysayers like the bagger , and ran right over the folks who tried to suggest that the film was not worthy because it did not serve as zionist propaganda but it did take some blows mr spielberg blamed the blogosphere , but the hand that struck it most efficiently was his own during an illconceived rollout and its hard to see a picture that picked itself off the mat go on to score the ultimate knockout so , to review the bagger has pledged to avoid creating conflict where none exists and brokeback is a huge , worthy favorite except it has tiny problems , nothing to dwell on , really as far as the bagger can tell , it will be a stately march for brokeback to the podium , unless the horse bucks at an inopportune moment and somebody is in a position to go blazing past photos top , a scene from brokeback mountain \( kimberley french focus features \) bottom , thandie newton in crash \( lorey sebastian lions gate films \)

to the editor i want to object to your characterization of the film what the bleep do we know ! \? i was a member of a panel of scholars asked to comment on the film in a discussion at a movie theater near my home in northern virginia the film does not blend science and spirituality , nor does it convey one iota of scientific information science requires testing , experimentation , and empirically grounded criticism , none of which played any role in the film ted kinnaman fairfax , va the writer is the chairman of the department of philosophy at george mason university
readers respond to bob herbert s may 8 column ,  david lang , jackson , miss hillary clinton s not being honest , but instead playing politics or , at least what she considers politics meanwhile , hillary is ignoring the reality that we are getting more and more people killed and maimed each and every day we remain in iraq she is refusing to take a clear stand , just as you write it s a horror to all of us who have feared from the beginning that this war is a failure , an embarrassment and a nightmare that is going to haunt our country and my children and grandchildren for years to come thank you for speaking out p harrison picot , haymarket va your article on hillary clinton is on the correct track , but , i think , allows her and bush credit where none is due both think we have done some good which will lead to a victory in iraq that looks something like what they said they would do that theory reminds me of why i gave up golf i thought i had a future as a decent amateur , until i read a helpful article by jack nicklaus , in which he said that the great shots by amateurs or pros are luck , not examples of what we could do with more practice he said the holeinone is as lucky as a ball in the lake , but we brag about it he was correct i thought that the good shots were all skill hillary clinton and bush fail to see that some of the good things in iraq are being helped along by leaders who see the results in punishing their enemies so destroying 60 mosques in falluja , and driving 200 , 000 former ba athists out of the town by destroying their homes along with driving out the same 1 , 000 or so insurgents we are always after , is seen as a good thing by people who want a civil war with saddam s supporters but it hardly leads to peace that is the war equivalent of making par on one hole it is not a sign of the future , or a confirmation of previous choices the truth is that hillary clinton and bush have had some good luck in iraq , just as bush did after katrina , but they claim the good luck as skill and blame the bad luck on the press william perry , atlanta c mon , bob the idea is to get elected that democrats were perceived as being soft on national security by the voters in 2004 is not paranoia all the postelection polls showed this was true hillary s prewar vote to give the president war powers was smart , however misinformed the vast majority of the american people already feel the president mislead the country with regards to iraq ultimately , it is the bush administration that is being blamed for the actual getting into this mess , not the mislead congress their low polls are as a result of other issues spending , gas prices , corruption , et al today , hillary can only look to the future and the only responsible stand she can take on iraq is to provide security while we see how the unified government takes shape if she cannot responsibly affect war policy in the minds of voters , why should she come out for immediate withdrawal , even if she wants it \? it would only ensure that the voters know the democrats are soft on national security and she would lose the presidency
twelveyearold aliana lohan was making funny faces , giggling , grimacing and blowing her long dark hair away from her face slouched in a striped wing chair in the plush living room of her family s colonialstyle home in north merrick , aliana , who is known as ali , fingered the gold chains around her neck , stretched her twiggylike legs and clicked her pointy black heels if she could have a role in any movie , aliana said , shrugging and looking coy , she would choose the part played by sandra bullock in miss congeniality like a princess assuming she will be the next queen , aliana did n't think becoming the toast of tinseltown was farfetched her sister , whose looks and raspy voice she shares , is lindsay lohan , the hollywood teen throb and paparazzi target asked how she would describe herself , aliana rolled her eyes and replied , funny people laugh at me like my jokes , not personally at me , she said her sister is known for her onscreen wit , aliana said but watch out lindsay s not as funny as me , aliana added with a smirk lindsay lohan , now 19 , hit the limelight with the 1998 disney remake of the parent trap , when she was aliana s age , followed by freaky friday , confessions of a teenage drama queen , mean girls and herbie fully loaded a prairie home companion with meryl streep is coming out in june aliana , who had cameo roles in the parent trap and freaky friday , said she often watched when lindsay was filming she followed like a little puppy dog , said dina lohan , their mother and the manager of her four children s careers the ontheset training may pay off dina lohan , who studied with the american ballet theater under mikhail baryshnikov , has apparently mastered the art of stage mother she said she had been positioning aliana to follow lindsay s it girl trajectory she s on the track , basically , ms lohan said , discounting the pitfalls of fame that have dogged lindsay , including a tabloid focus on her partygirl image , reports about bulimia and a car accident involving paparazzi last christmas aliana recorded her first single , rockin' around the christmas tree , on totally awesome christmas volume one , sharing the compilation disc with hilary duff , among others recently aliana was at tainted blue studios in manhattan finishing up her debut solo album with chris christian , chief executive of world digital media group and a producer , singer and songwriter who has worked with elvis presley , olivia newtonjohn and sheena easton aliana also won a leading role in an independent movie that starts shooting this spring in kansas city there are a couple of studios vying for it , dina lohan said negotiations are also under way for a network television series big sister is helping lindsay will obviously recommend ali for roles , their mother said if something comes up and there is a little girl in the movie , she will have ali read for it but having a famous sibling is no guarantee it s harder for ali because ali s going to have to try twice as hard , ms lohan said at some auditions , directors assume it s in her genes , she said others will scrutinize her for how she got in the door it can go either way , ms lohan said nor is it always a picnic with her peers aliana s favorite lindsay lohan movie is mean girls \( 2004 \) since aliana started seeking the spotlight , she said , she has encountered some meanness herself her sixthgrade classmates at old mill road school , aliana said , sometimes get jealous , which has been going on a lot i thought it would be fun and they would be proud of me , she added aliana said that her big sister advised her to ignore everything else and just do what you 've got to do last year , when lindsay lohan directed and sang in a music video , confessions of a broken heart , about the breakup of their parents' marriage , aliana wore a tutu , clutched a teddy bear and sobbed , playing her older sister i had to cry in it , but i just thought of something sad , aliana recalled it was really easy for me , because my sister was with me to tell me to do this and that in an email message , lindsay lohan said i am so proud of my little sister ali she was amazing in my video 'confessions of a broken heart' she is so talented , and i am here for her 100 percent ! paparazzi are already snapping her photo when we walk out of the restaurant , they 're like 'ali , over here ! ' aliana said they call me , too a few months ago aliana signed autographs , as if she were already a teen queen , at a ronald mcdonald house event in manhattan but most of the time aliana is just a regular preteen she plays forward and , when necessary , defense for the merrick jaguars , a travel soccer team she likes to sneak into her older sister s closet with her friends and play dressup and cavort with the family dogs , polo , gucci and chloe aliana plays piano , wants to learn guitar , takes singing lessons and wrote some of her own lyrics for the album due out in november it s just girl gossip , aliana said , refusing to disclose the words like all the lohan siblings , aliana is a ford model she started at 18 months though dina lohan said her sons are more into sports than stardom , michael lohan , 18 , and dakota , 9 , are also no strangers to the cameras
how chaotic have things gotten in the republican party in new jersey \? well , to give you some idea , the party is having backlashes against backlashes first , tom kean jr angered the party s conservative wing by acting like a timid moderate the pique of the rightwingers begat the candidacy of john ginty , a conservative financial data analyst who is now challenging mr kean in the republican primary to see who will seek the united state senate seat now held by robert menendez , who wants to hold on to it mr ginty s move was applauded by marie tasy , the executive director of new jersey right to life , and steve lonegan , the outspokenly conservative mayor of bogota now thom ammirato , a republican consultant who worked for mr lonegan s gubernatorial campaign last year , is lashing out at mr lonegan and company for being a bunch of babies if they do n't get what they want , they take their ball and go home , he wrote in an email message mr ammirato , who was a spokesman for former bergen county executive pat schuber also said he thought that the current leaders of the republican party were at fault for refusing to stand for something asked how he distinguished between those leaders and mr kean , he wrote i do n't none of them have anything of value to offer josh benson
east to hold off redskins , manning and giants must improve this may be the nfl s deepest division , with any team capable of making the playoffs the washington redskins have the veteran talent to unseat the giants as the division champions acquiring antwaan randle el and brandon lloyd will strengthen a washington receiving corps that features the electric santana moss and the dependable tight end chris cooley assuming clinton portis recovers from a preseason shoulder injury , the running game should be potent the redskins traded for t j duckett as insurance in case portis has problems recovering the defense is solid , anchored by linebacker marcus washington and safeties sean taylor and adam archuleta teams coached by joe gibbs almost always finish strong , and the redskins should manage at least 10 victories , enough to return to the playoffs the giants have super bowl aspirations , but that may be a stretch the offense has superb talent , with tiki barber at running back , plaxico burress at wide receiver and jeremy shockey at tight end but it will be difficult for the giants to repeat as the division champions unless quarterback eli manning raises his game look for more teams to key on barber , daring manning to beat them the carolina panthers did that during the playoffs last season and defeated the giants , 230 defensively , the giants addressed their needs during free agency , acquiring linebacker lavar arrington and defensive backs sam madison and will demps arrington was once one of the league s most feared linebackers , especially when he rushed the passer the giants hope arrington will boost an already formidable pass rush , led by defensive ends michael strahan and osi umenyiora if they perform as expected , the giants could create nightmares for opposing quarterbacks but sooner or later , barber and strahan will slow down , and if manning remains inconsistent , the giants may have another short run in the playoffs , if they get there at all by the middle of last season , the philadelphia eagles were a disabled , dysfunctional team their quarterback , donovan mcnabb , was lost to a hernia injury terrell owens was off the team after feuding with mcnabb and alienating the coaching staff and the front office by the end of the season , the eagles were 610 , their worst record since 1999 the eagles are unlikely to reach miami in february , but they look poised for a bounceback season mcnabb is healthy , free of t o and eager to prove he is one of the game s top quarterbacks without owens s bigplay ability , philadelphia will revert to its dumpandrun offense with mcnabb throwing highpercentage passes to running back brian westbrook , tight end l j smith and wide receiver donte' stallworth defense is where the eagles should improve significantly the acquisition of defensive end darren howard will aid the pass rush , which is anchored by defensive end jevon kearse more pressure on the quarterback should help philadelphia s veteran secondary of safeties brian dawkins and michael lewis , and cornerbacks lito sheppard and sheldon brown look for the eagles to win at least eight games , and , with a little luck , challenge for the division title jerry jones , the owner of the dallas cowboys , gambled by signing owens even if owens behaves and contributes , the cowboys have a suspect offensive line and an inconsistent running attack bill parcells is a great coach , but the cowboys have not won a playoff game during his three seasons in dallas in a weaker division , the cowboys would fare better but in this division , they could finish in last place west postsuper bowl stumbles will end with the seahawks the seattle seahawks are well aware that the past five super bowl losers have missed the playoffs the next season but seattle has the talent to avoid the postsuper bowl blues matt hasselbeck is not a glamour quarterback , but he is a winner he does not overwhelm opponents with arm strength , but he almost always throws accurately he is also a master at buying time in the pocket coach mike holmgren has developed hasselbeck into a franchise quarterback , as he did with brett favre in green bay shaun alexander was the nfl s best running back last season , scoring a record 28 touchdowns and rushing for 1 , 880 yards , and the seahawks rewarded him with a lucrative contract some expect alexander to lose his edge with a bigger bank account , but losing to pittsburgh in the super bowl gives alexander and his teammates motivation the defense should be as solid as last season s seattle has two talented young linebackers , lofa tatupu and leroy hill both were superb as rookies , and they ignite a defense that is aggressive and smart the seahawks have one of the league s biggest homefield advantages they play in a loud stadium , and they often face teams that have traveled through several times zones with its talent and experience , seattle is poised to make another super bowl run the arizona cardinals have reason for optimism , with a new stadium their new running back , edgerrin james and their splendid wide receivers , anquan boldin and larry fitzgerald but the cardinals still have holes , particularly on the offensive line
the price of grapes in kandahar is in free fall wooden carts with tall wheels are lining up side by side at their traditional spot in front of police headquarters , each one lit at night by the pinprick of a single kerosene lantern this week , the merchants are parting with their carefully arrayed jewels for just 15 cents a pound swift fluctuations in produce prices are typical here , depending on what makes it to the wholesale market on a given day , on the rains , on parasites , and at the moment on the situation grapes are down because of the fighting in panjwayi panjwayi district , just west and south of kandahar proper , is grape country , as arghandab is pomegranate country the packed earth plain is ruled off in serried ranks venerable vines , their trunks thick as a forearm , lean heavily against the mud walls farmers have built to support them deep channels carry precious water to their roots the kandahar fruit market is surprisingly sophisticated several weeks before harvest , big traders or their representatives , who may ship tons of fruit to kabul or pakistan or india , fan out into the countryside and inspect orchards and vineyards with the unripe fruit still on the branch , they bargain with farmers for entire orchards it s a kind of rudimentary futures market but with the fighting in panjwayi , no one visited this year and so its luscious grapes , four or five varieties , flood the kandahar bazaar a pride of elders approached the provincial council last week to request a ceasefire for the harvest period , so the crop would not be a total loss the most sophisticated produce traders of all are the opium dealers opium is a perfectly integrated element in the local economy at harvest time for poppies , tinkers prominently display the tools of the trade in heaps small sticks with two teeth for scoring the stems , and woodedged metal scrapers for collecting the sap it is not just the market value that induces so many people to plant the frillyedged pink and white blooms with homegrown savvy , opium traders offer farmers a range of often irresistible advantages the most important of these is credit there are no financial institutions to speak of in kandahar , so there is no way to take out a loan even though loans are needed not only for yearly agricultural inputs such as fertilizer , but for the several major outlays every family incurs for example , in afghanistan , bride price , not dowry , is the cultural norm it costs a family 5 , 000 to 10 , 000 to marry off a son a fortune usually , the new bride leaves her family s home and joins that of her husband often a new room must be added to the family compound in these cases , one of the few people a family can borrow from is the local opium trafficker typical terms include repayment in a year , in opium , which is counted at half the market value making the transaction in effect a 100percent interest loan dealers also solve farmers logistics problems by picking up the opium paste at the farm gate another factor pushing farmers toward the cultivation of poppies is the scarcity of water if it is exceptionally dry and growers must in effect pay for water because they must buy diesel to fire the pumps that draw it up from wells then they may well have to take land out of production , because it is simply too expensive to water that means many farmers must plant their reduced acreage with a highvalue crop in order to survive because of these constraints , it does not seem sensible to focus antiopium campaigns on growers growers need as i have heard village elders repeat since i began working in kandahar in 2002 improved infrastructure for transporting their produce to market and assistance with techniques to expand their market access , such as training in how to clean and package their dry fruit for the international market perhaps above all , they need access to credit but since the fall of the taliban , farmers have seen almost none of these things except improved primary and secondary roads a coldstorage warehouse financed by the indian government was completed only this spring , and local and provincial authorities are still squabbling over jurisdiction and how it should be regulated so it remains padlocked , while panjwayi s grapes rot in the market opium eradication campaigns target the lowest rung of the opium economy , the struggling farmers yet wellknown traffickers strut around town , flaunting their connections with senior officials they drive latemodel suv s they buy up property at fantastic prices and build wedding cake villas the kind that used to be rented out to alqaeda members trading in bulk opium is not the only way to make a killing off it eradication campaigns themselves have proven a gold mine for corrupt public officials in 2002 , compensation vouchers in helmand province were sold to people who did not even own farmland since then , i have come to know of a provincial governor and a district administrator who have routinely offered protection from eradication to whole villages , for a price government officials provision of safe passage to opium convoys for a flat fee or a cut of the profits is a matter of common knowledge i know one governor and two security officials who , when they caught an opium shipment and arrested those conveying it , received calls or written orders from superiors commanding them to let the goods go in two such cases , the subordinate who balked was dismissed from his position so glaring are these realities that everyone in southern afghanistan is aware of them and they make a mockery of all the pious handwringing by international and afghan officials about the opium problem they make a mockery of any pretense that the posttaliban government might be lawabiding and accountable and they open the door to taliban insurgents , who this spring in panjwayi set themselves up as the defenders of farmers against unjust government eradication
maybe it was somebody s idea of a very inside joke but for some time now new york state officials have referred to a huge pool of hidden money that albany legislators appropriate annually as the 007 accounts these accounts amount to 200 million each year to finance a long list of porkbarrel projects across the state the money is controlled by state leaders and appears in the budget in anonymous chunks , listed under health care , economic development or some other broad category this is camouflage for hundreds of socalled member items small and mediumsize public projects in each legislator s home district the clandestine way that 007 money is parceled out would make q himself proud very little about these items is disclosed to the public the scant records available on the state senate web site offer glimpses of items like 25 , 000 for a youth center \( no address given \) or 112 , 000 for dental clinics \( no locations listed \) it would take a fulltime investigator to figure out why one baseball field receives state aid and not another , and that is apparently how joseph bruno , the senate majority leader , and sheldon silver , the assembly speaker , want to keep it controlling these millions allows the leaders to control their legislators member items are , in fact , a form of legislative blackmail no politician wants to be held responsible for losing funds for the home district so when mr bruno whispers a command , republican senators jump when mr silver beckons his herd , democratic assembly members trip over one another to get to him this is no way to create a robust and democratic legislature and it is no way to sort out the priorities for spending the public s money the governor and leaders of the minority parties in each house traditionally get a share of these slush funds , and in recent months they have decided to open up their books , showing where the money goes that s the right response but mr bruno and mr silver argue that it s none of the public s business how the public s money is spent reporters at the times union of albany spent months trying to use the new york freedom of information law to uncover details of the 007 accounts frustrated , the newspaper filed suit on june 21 against mr silver and mr bruno to force them to cough up the information it may be worth noting that the newspaper s editors had trouble finding a lawyer in albany for this case apparently the idea of bucking mr bruno and mr silver in the state capitol is about as popular as kicking the soccer referee who hands out the red cards as the times union discovered in the course of its investigation , the leaders have many reasons for keeping things quiet grants are often awarded to community centers , clinics or other enterprises whose payrolls are padded with family members and friends of the local legislators last year , one chunk of money found its way to a charity controlled by former senator guy velella , even after mr velella was jailed for taking bribes were they ever to become completely public , the files would surely yield many more conflicts of interest and cases in which state funds are quietly funneled to relatives and contributors that is to be expected when the funneling happens under cover of darkness it s time to blow the covers off albany s secret 007 accounts

a fine wine will deliver layers of flavor that unfold on the palate call it complexity similarly , a good plate of food , even a slab of steak , should not be onedimensional but must bring various tastes and textures into play , and do it harmoniously over and over again as i tasted the dolcettos with the panel , i noted alluring tastes of tobacco , black cherries and earth that were impressively balanced the seamless grace in many of these dolcettos suggested compatibility with a number of ingredients , though none with overwhelmingly strong flavors mushrooms , for example i wanted to build a dish that combined them with other subtle elements , like a rich pasta , some sweetly meaty pork , a whiff of garlic and a shower of parsley i opted for dried porcini so that the liquid that resulted from rehydrating them could be used to moisten the pasta for this main dish , i used eggs to thicken and enrich the mushrooms and pasta , as in spaghetti carbonara the eggs must be heated only enough to become custardy , without scrambling at the same time , you do not want the pasta to cool down so your bowls or plates must be warm , the pasta wellmixed and hot , and you , the cook , must not be distracted for a second with an efficient onetwothreefour , you remove the pan from the burner , fold in the eggs , divide the dressed fettuccine among the bowls and serve it immediately the freshly grated cheese will already have been placed on the table , and of course the dolcetto will have been poured fettuccine with porcini time 1 hour 2 ounces dried porcini 5 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil 1 1 2 ounces pancetta , finely diced 2 cloves garlic , sliced salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 pound fresh fettuccine 4 eggs at room temperature , beaten 1 1 2 tablespoons minced flatleaf parsley leaves grated parmigianoreggiano for serving 1 place porcini in a bowl , cover with about 1 cup warm water , and soak 30 minutes drain well , straining liquid into large measuring cup place porcini on several thicknesses of paper towel , cover with paper towel and press to remove moisture cut very large pieces in half 2 meanwhile , heat 3 tablespoons oil in a skillet large enough to hold pasta for 4 servings add pancetta and saut \? ntil barely beginning to brown add garlic and saut \? minute or so 3 add porcini and cook until heated through and beginning to brown remove from heat season with salt and pepper warm 4 plates 4 bring a pot of salted water to a boil for pasta cook pasta about 3 minutes and drain well transfer to skillet , add remaining oil , and cook over low heat to incorporate and heat ingredients gradually add 3 4 cup porcini liquid when some has been absorbed , remove pan from heat add eggs and fold together quickly , to warm eggs without scrambling them add a little more liquid if needed immediately divide among plates and garnish with parsley serve at once with cheese alongside yield 4 servings

to the editor re public misled on air quality after 9 11 attack , judge says \( news article , feb 3 \) the finding that the public was misled on air quality after the 9 11 attack on the world trade center has confirmed some of our most unsettling fears by telling us something we already know , but have not yet been able to accept this is maddening enough but what s at least as infuriating are politicians' statements more than four years later decrying the outrageous conduct of the environmental protection agency and the federal government in providing information about air quality in lower manhattan it s significant because this is an issue about the interests of society , and the continuity and change in its institutions , which means that it is an issue that is neither liberal nor conservative liberal politicians have been quick to malign the conservative administration that oversaw the epa when 9 11 occurred however , these are the same liberal politicians who have been incensed when conservative politicians have used 9 11 to benefit their political means and ends this contradiction resolves none of the problems in lower manhattan or in our nation s capital , and will do nothing to prepare the epa to react to the next terrorist attack lee h igel new york , feb 3 , 2006
there are 108 licensed dogs in this village of 4 , 800 , but as so often happens elsewhere in the county and in communities far beyond , none of them are free to roam unleashed on public property that , however , is about to change the village is officially opening its first offleash , fencedin dog park today in a quarteracre plot at the corner of north evarts and winthrop avenues , a former staging site for transportation workers just off interstate 287 elmsford s mayor , robert williams , a selfdescribed dog lover who does not own a dog at the moment \( his last one , a shih tzu , died about a year ago \) , said the park was right in the middle of the village , which is nice , but it s also close to 287 , so it wo n't bother the people who say that dogs bark too much twothirds of the park s area is reserved for large breeds , while the rest is for small ones , he said the process of creating the dog park seems to have unfolded with none of the squabbles and controversy that have mired them elsewhere in pound ridge , dog owners have lobbied the town unsuccessfully for three years to designate a leashfree play area for dogs in greenburgh , the town board has not approved a proposal to construct a dog park , mainly because of liability concerns , said paul j feiner , the town s supervisor mayor williams said he was not worried about lawsuits in elmsford the village s insurance company will treat the dog park just like every other municipal park , he said if something happens to a dog or to a person , he said , it should be handled the same way as we handle a kid who falls off a swing the town s insurance rates will not rise because of the dog park , he said the village will ban violent dogs and allow only those who have had their shots to enter the park , mayor williams said he said the police would conduct spot checks of vaccination tags there are two other dog parks in westchester county , in ossining and in white plains , county officials said in white plains , which opened its dog park off belway place in 2004 , liability is assigned to the dog owners , who also play a role in keeping the park clean , said arne abramowitz , the city s commissioner of recreation and parks it s pretty much selfpolicing , mr abramowitz said if you do n't clean up after your dog , people will say , 'this is not appropriate , ' or 'this is gross and you should n't do it' the dog park has also become a popular spot for singles , especially on fridays , when dog owners meet and make dates for the weekend , he said mayor williams said that dozens of residents in elmsford had asked officials over the past two years to create a dog park last winter , the town picked the site , fenced it in during the spring and installed benches , a water fountain and garbage cans to collect dog waste , at a cost of less than 5 , 000 angela white , 37 , has two labrador retrievers , biscuit and donut , whom she keeps on a leash when she takes them for a walk ms white said that she , her husband , martin , and their two children planned to celebrate donut s 7th birthday today by taking the dogs to the park for their first free run since puppy school the dogs love icecream cake , so we 're going to have to bring a cake down , she said it should be a little party for our family , but if other dogs feel like it , they 're welcome to join in photo play angela and martin white with their 5yearold son , anthony , and their labrador retrievers biscuit , jumping , and donut in elmsford s dog park , which officially opens today \( photo by alan zale for the new york times \)
for those of you who keep pining for a united states in which everyone cares deeply about soccer , we refer you to the onion s vision of such a land as it would have appeared a couple of days after the americans 30 loss to the czech republic a country where the dow jones average plummets 600 points , the suicide rate spikes and bruce arena comes close to accepting responsibility without publicly shaming his players but all that is the stuff of satire as we write this on the eve of the makeorbreak match saturday against italy , a match in which even a lifeprolonging draw seems like a long shot , american soccer fans are girding themselves for some very real disappointment it s entirely possible , of course , that the amerks will get a good result , even a victory but just in case they don t , it would be a good idea to get some things straight before the hammer comes down starting with just how good the us national team really is , or was every american soccer fan in the know understands that the fifa world rankings are nothing more than a promotional vehicle for cocacola and , therefore , that the amerks no 5 ranking is irrelevant but to those not in the know \( many newscasters and sportscasters \) , and to those for whom the no 5 ranking is good business \( networks and advertisers \) , that status was worth trumpeting and after a while , it became an endless feedback loop , constantly repeated and taking on a factualness that eventually had knowledgable us fans thinking , we might not be no 5 in the world , but surely we re in the top dozen there seemed to be real evidence for that belief at japan korea 2002 , the americans reached the quarterfinals and were unlucky not to beat mighty germany , losing by 10 while having a certain penalty for handball on the goal line refused the yanks put on a fine performance in that tournament , but the thing about that world cup was that it was held in asia , on neutral ground , where you could throw out the form book the 2002 world cup was one in which not only the us did well so too did turkey , korea , japan , and a couple of other countries unaccustomed to success asia was uncharted territory , where the old habits of european teams dominating on european soil and south american teams dominating on latin american soil did not apply \( it s the same way in hockey , the one international team sport with a spread of competition roughly analogous to that of soccer canada and the us win when the olympic tournament is held in north america and european teams win in europe , but when it was held in japan in 1998 , all bets were off , the us and canada crashed out , and the czechs won \) the us reaching the quarterfinals at the funhouse of japan korea 2002 is one thing , but wait just how well did the amerks really do \? they won two matches , tied one , and lost two that s a 500 record another test for the idea of rising american power would have been a surge in signings of us players by big european clubs but that did not really take place damarcus beasley , landon donovan , tim howard , and a small number of others were snapped up , but that big surge never took place so while american fans believed the team s 2002 performance was proof of power \( while not looking too closely at that performance in actual statistical terms \) , the big european clubs did not even though it s their business to buy up the best players , wherever they may come from american fans , both the smart ones and the casual , also tended to poohpooh the team s many unconvincing performances over the last year minnows like panama gave the us fits in actual competitions , and in friendly matches on home soil the amerks had to struggle to get results against the likes of canada , jamaica and latvia in europe they beat poland but were slaughtered by germany this was not the way a toplevel team played , but whenever concerns were raised , they tended to be dismissed all the best american players weren t there , results weren t important , etc stubbornly , the us team itself didn t seem worried about all this there was no sense of urgency in the final couple of months leading up to the world cup , despite the weaknesses the shellacking by germany exposed friendlies were scheduled with weak opponents and were jammed into a fiveday period all three of those matches were played in the us , and none were scheduled for europe , despite the difficulties every team from the americas even brazil and argentina has experienced over the decades in playing world cups on the old continent instead , bruce arena and the us federation tried to replicate the training regimen from japan korea 2002 only they forgot one thing a european world cup is an entirely different animal from an asian world cup and indeed , the results at germany 2006 have held up remarkably close to form the big european powers have all been winning , whether boringly or with flair , and the usual suspects from south america , brazil and argentina , have won so far too as always in europe there has been a little room for a surprise package , but that role has been played by ecuador , not the united states perhaps the us can surprise against italy , but that would go against world cup history and the form book so far at this tournament it would also go against the evidence of the last four years , which we now see was saying all along that the united states wasn t all that good to begin with what takes place at kaiserslautern on saturday will tell us if that is true

the headline on the times s aug 16 obituary for leonard h marks troubled his son , because it said the late mr marks had helped lyndon johnson get rich rob marks , the son , complained that the get rich phrase cast his father , a communications lawyer who helped the late president and his wife acquire the television stations that built their fortune , in a questionable light i passed the son s email to bill mcdonald , the obituaries editor , who found the complaint a valid one but mr mcdonald also carefully explained the space limitations that make an obituary headline difficult to compose , especially when it seeks to put in a nutshell the life of an accomplished individual here s the complete exchange of emails between mr marks and mr mcdonald  to the public editor i am writing to complain about a recent \( wednesday , august 16 \) obituary that the times carried about my father , leonard h marks the article itself was fine \( with one exception , noted below \) , with several good stories and anecdotes that illustrated dad s views , particularly about lyndon johnson and his family and their media holdings what i found troubling , for several reasons , was the headline l h marks , 90 , dies helped lyndon johnson get rich my principal objection is that there is a clear pejorative tone to the choice of words , get rich , which i feel casts his legal work for the johnsons in a questionable light certainly good lawyers intend for their clients to make money \( or to prevent them from losing money \) , and i do not question the accuracy of the claim that dad s efforts served to help the johnsons enhance the value of their radio and tv assets the choice of those words implies that something underhanded or sleazy or unethical was done that this may have happened is alluded to in the ninth paragraph in the article , but that claim is by no means proven or certain i find that the use of the words get rich subliminally indicates that the times feels some chicanery was at hand , that dad had a role in it , and that this is his legacy i have looked at the ny times headlines for others who have recently died , and in no case did i find a similar pejorative slant in the headline most amazing was the headline for the obituary of general alfredo stroessner on thursday , august 17 , who was described as a colorful dictator of paraguay for 35 years , while the story discusses his reign as being charcterized by fraudulent elections , very uneven wealth and land distribution , a haven for nazi s including josef mengele , and hundreds of political prisoners imprisoned in concentration camps colorful , indeed i even went back to see what the times had said about controversial figures in the past ken lay \( july 6 , 2006 \) enron founder and symbol of corporate excess lee atwater \( march , 1991 \) master of tactics for bush and gop and strom thurmond \( june 2003 \) senate institution who fought integration i believe that most of your obituary headlines refer generally to the work of the decesed with no judgment attached conga player , author , or ornithologist for example moreover , lyndon johnson s administration ended on january 20 , 1969 , more than 37 years ago while the work of my father that had the greatest impact on the nation certainly related to lyndon johnson and his presidency , the headline totally ignores his efforts on behalf of the country and notforprofit causes afterwards the obituary itself summarizes all of his efforts serving on four international delegations , two as chairman major involvement in the establishment of communications satellite entities \( comsat and intelsat \) heading up important notforprofit organizations such as the international rescue committee , world press freedom committee , radio free europe and radio liberty serving on the executive committee for the think tank the center for strategic and international studies in one short paragraph at the very end , which i think underweights his contributions clearly , the headline writer in my father s case made the judgment that his efforts to help make lyndon johnson rich were worthy of singling out , to the exclusion of all else that he did , and contrary to what appears to be the usual practice of the times , using words that few would find complimentary or laudable i find this attitude unacceptable in an obituary , gratuitously meanspirited frankly , for a 90 year old man who served his country well in many many ways i should point out that none of the other publications which ran dad s obituary the washington post , the los angeles times , the boston globe , fox news chose words for their headlines to characterize his work in the way that the times did i considered the possibility that i was just being overly sensitive i can assure you that i have received any number of comments from friends and former colleagues of dad s who have expressed their condolences and added , what a shame about that headline in the new york times robert evan marks  mr marks , your email to the public editor about the headline over your father s obituary was passed on to me , the obituaries editor at the paper i think your complaint is entirely valid under our editing system , the headline was written by a copy editor on our national news desk i actually had no hand in it but i have to say that it also gave me some pause when i saw it in the paper it was rather blunt , and i can understand how you might have read it as pejorative i m sure that that was not the intent , however in fact , having written many a headline myself , i could see that the copy editor had little space in which to maneuver \( over which he or she had no control the configuration of the page is determined by a layout editor such is the system \) so space constraints dictated a terse headline and get rich was an attempt to put in a nutshell the emphasis of the obituary that your father had helped the johnsons build their fortune but that s an explanation having more to do with production it doesn t necessarily take the sting away , i m sure interestingly , when i pointed out the headline to a few editors here , none took it as pejorative one said , well , if it said get rich quick , that would be another matter but clearly you didn t feel that way , and we re sorry for any distress caused if any readers shared your reaction , i think they would have soon understood , in reading the obituary , that your father performed his work with complete integrity as for the stroessner headline , you are entirely correct colorful was an egregious way to describe that repressive dictator what you apparently saw , however , was an early edition of the paper a senior news editor saw the headline in the early edition and , reacting as you did , had it changed for the later run so hundreds of thousands of our readers were spared that one again , our apologies and please accept our condolences as well sincerely , william mcdonald obituaries editor the new york times  bill thank you for your reply and the earnest effort to explain what may have happened however , i must say , that notwithstanding space and time constraints that i am sure are real , i believe that copy editors on the ny times national news desk choose their words with care and thought , and he she could have found other words that would have fit into the allotted space as the headline gave you some pause due to its rather blunt nature , i can only conclude that there was some intent behind it , whatever that may have been in any event , it is what it is , and , along with the stroessner headline , perhaps some more oversight of the headline writers is called for sincerely , rob marks

from their introduction to each other 20 years ago to the sudden death of one of them last year , rene price always surprised betty jordan ms price and ms jordan met late in life , fell in love and registered as domestic partners but because of the vague wording in new jersey s domestic partnership act extending certain rights and benefits to gay and lesbian couples when it was passed two years ago , and a legislative clarification that came too late , ms jordan could lose her partner s house , savings and two cars it bothers me that they might take 20 years of my happiness what i have left and try to take it away , said ms jordan , 66 , who still lives in the house in perth amboy that she and ms price called home it makes me sad , it makes me angry to hear ms jordan tell it , this jolt is just the latest in a series of surprises in the relationship shared by the two women a mutual friend introduced ms price and ms jordan in may 1986 tall and lean with a frenetic personality , ms price was working as a high school physical education teacher in brooklyn during the day and a new york city bus driver at night ms jordan sold cosmetics at the woodbridge center mall i knew the moment i laid eyes on her there was something about rene , ms jordan said she was just so sincere , a very caring person , an honest person in 2000 , ms price took ms jordan to see a white brick cottage in perth amboy , where they were already living together in an apartment across town ms jordan said that she asked why they were there and that ms price replied it s yours we 're on our way to closing then , on new year s eve 2004 , the couple registered at the perth amboy city hall as domestic partners ms price had retired from her teaching job in 2001 , though she continued to drive a crosstown bus in manhattan on weekends , the couple would work around the house on july 28 , 2005 , as ms price went through her checklist to prepare her bus for the day s shift , she collapsed and died of a heart attack at age 61 we loved each other , but not only that , we were in love with each other , she said for 19 years we were in each other s lives we breathed for each other still grieving , ms jordan went about the necessary but emotionally painful work of dealing with ms price s estate , which included the white brick house , the cars and a bank account with a 9 , 000 balance but when ms jordan went to the middlesex county surrogate , kevin j hoagland , to clear up the estate , he listed her as no relation and refused to allow her control of the property until she posted a bond of more than 250 , 000 and provided a letter from ms price s surviving relatives relinquishing their rights to the estate for their part , ms price s brother and two sisters , who do not live in the area , said they recognized ms jordan s right to the inheritance we have no right to rene s estate , betty has the right to her estate , mary l clore , one of ms price s sisters , said in a telephone interview from virginia beach , va me , my sister and my brother would never want to be a barrier for betty then it seemed as if ms jordan s final barrier had fallen with a legislative amendment to the domestic partnership act , which richard j codey , then the acting governor , signed in january in the wake of another lesbian couple s efforts to win rights through the law in that case , lt laurel hester , an investigator in the ocean county prosecutor s office , who was dying of cancer , fought for and won the right for her partner to inherit her pension benefits inspired by lieutenant hester , the legislature approved and mr codey signed into law two bills that extended the rights of domestic partners in new jersey to include pension benefits and allowed them to be recognized as surviving spouses this law would have resolved the problem for ms jordan except that it was passed six months after ms price died , and the legislature made no stipulation that the new laws should be retroactive so even though none of ms price s surviving family members claim the estate , the surrogate still cannot apply the new law to her case at the time of the application there was no provision under the domestic partnership act , mr hoagland said at the time the act went into effect , he said , he and the 20 other county surrogates foresaw problems ahead we all knew that it would be an issue , mr hoagland said with no other choice left , ms price hired a lawyer and filed a suit in state superior court in middlesex county against mr hoagland s office , contending that under a broad interpretation of the existing act , ms jordan should be considered a surviving spouse we believe that the domestic partnership act intended this to be one of those rights , said her lawyer , steven j hyland , who also argued that the new law should be applied retroactively if ms jordan prevails in her suit , she will become the administrator of ms price s estate , mr hyland said , at the same time possibly broadening the interpretation of the domestic partnership act and providing more rights for samesex couples if she loses , the estate will go to ms price s siblings , who have stated that they will simply let the state take it over rather than give it to ms jordan , who would become saddled with an array of estate taxes we 've left it up to the superior court , mr hoagland said photo betty jordan , 66 , has filed a suit seeking to inherit the estate of her domestic partner of 20 years , rene price , at left in photograph \( photo by aaron houston for the new

if you want a nominee for nastiest political fight in 2006 , the frontrunner , hands down , has been the bloodbath that has erupted within the usually genteel bergen county republican party it started with an oped article in the record on jan 11 , in which alan c marcus , a public relations executive who led the organization in the 1960 s , lambasted the leadership for being absent and decimated so he announced that he wanted to start a revolution , and become the next party chairman the man mr marcus wants to unseat , guy f talarico , would have none of that he accused mr marcus of being a republican in name only because of donations to democrats , which mr marcus says are a routine in lobbying and public relations mr marcus then upset the balance of power by persuading the only two republicans now elected to county office kathleen donovan , county clerk , and elizabeth randall , a freeholder to join him mr talarico put state senator thomas h kean jr , who is running for the united states senate , on the hot seat , and asked if he was , with apologies to president bush , with us or against us oh , and do n't forget the pushing and shoving at a raucous county convention a couple of weeks ago at one level , the fight for supremacy is a local one about the present the chairmanship will be decided in june the primary between mr marcus s candidate for county executive , ms donovan , and mr talarico s , todd c caliguire , a former county freeholder , will be in june the winner will then take on the democratic incumbent , dennis mcnerney but the fight could well have a bearing on the state party no republican running for statewide office has ever won without carrying bergen , the state s most populous and prosperous county and this is something that has not been lost on mr kean , who is facing a tough fight against sen robert menendez to mr talarico , the battle is chiefly about ideology he counts as among his strongest allies steve lonegan , the conservative mayor of bogota , who ran a fiery but unsuccessful race for the republican nomination for governor and he said that the reason douglas r forrester lost to mr corzine was because he was a democratlite who did n't have a powerful message what i 've been trying to do is adopt our core principles , and adopt the national party platform , mr talarico said this is the liberals marcus and his crew trying to block the efforts for us to become a true republican party and donovan \? a huge liberal to mr marcus , the battle is not about ideology , but about a desire to jumpstart a party that has been thoroughly outfoxed and outspent in recent years and to remember what winning feels like you 've got to stop the bleeding , mr marcus said and when you have the county executive s race and a strong candidate for the us senate , you 've got a unique opportunity to raise money and attract voters who have n't come out before there has n't been this much excitement in a long time part of the reason the fight has been so contentious is because ms donovan and her slate technically entered the race too late to be nominated for the official line on the june primary ballot as might be expected , both sides have been vacuuming endorsements on a neardaily basis mr caliguire picked up the support of the former assembly majority leader paul digaetano ms donovan won the backing of state senator henry mcnamara , who lost the county executive s race in 2002 to mr mcnerney on march 10 , assemblywoman charlotte vandervalk , in a letter to mr talarico , expressed shock at the appalling conduct over the shoving and shouting at the march 7 county convention the same day , mr talarico wrote to mr kean , and gave him three days to decide whether he would run on the official party line if not , mr talarico wrote , the line would be deemed vacant and that kind of language , to everyone but mr talarico , came across as an ultimatum mr kean s camp was not amused tom kean jr does not respond to ultimatums , said jill hazelbaker , his press secretary period in any event , whichever slate prevails will face an uphill battle in november after all , bergen county has quickly become a democratic stronghold after years of republican domination and part of that success must be attributed to the aggressive fundraising , organizing and outreach efforts of the party chairman , joseph a ferriero mr ferriero has been so good , in fact , that some republicans are envious so if you ca n't join them , perhaps imitate them the republican party needs someone like that , said rick shaftan , a consultant who worked with mr lonegan last year , someone who can take charge and lead

a program last week at the museum of television and radio in new york celebrating polaroid s legendary threedecade advertising campaign by doyle dane bernbach , now part of ddb worldwide , showed how much things have changed since 1985 , when this collaboration ended alan alda , the actor , who briefly appeared in the campaign in 1976 , said that until sir laurence olivier made commercials for polaroid earlier in the decade , wellknown movie and television stars were often advised not to participate in campaigns for consumer products you would n't want to be called a sellout by selling a product , he said selling out was frowned on , whereas now you can major in it at business school asked if market research and focus groups were employed to prepare the advertising , peter c wensberg , a former senior vice president at polaroid , replied , almost none he knew , he added , that the commercials were good when you looked at 'em , you said , 'gee , those are good commercials' some things have n't changed , however ted voss , a former group vice president at polaroid , recalled , we always had to rationalize why we were spending this serious money on advertising that featured celebrities jane l levere

i think they are hideous kenny lofton skies out to floyd in left nomar hits a sharp grounder deep to short and beats out the throw from reyes but he limps past first looks like he s strained a thigh muscle \( again ! \) but he s staying in the game jeff kent is up with one out and nomar on first kent hits a liner into left for a base hit garciaparra trots into second first and second , one out , with drew at the plate drew takes a called strike three on a ball that just paints the outside corner of the plate two out russell martin is up tom brennaman and steve lyons point out that with two outs , nomar has an advantage in that he can run on any hit so even though he is limping he might be able to score but martin swings at a 30 pitch ! and he flies out harmless to right , leaving two on base side retired bottom of the third due up chavezglavinereyes endy chaves bunts up the first base line , and kuo can t pick it up but as steve lyons points out on fox , even if he had fielded it , nomar was out of position to get a throw a base hit for chavez tom glavine fouls off his first bunt attempt kuo is now preoccupied with chavez at first , throwing over a few times another foul bunt by glavine will he try a third or swing away \? he looks ready to bunt on the next pitch , but barely manages to get the bat out of the way the next pitch is high and tight and goes all the way to the backstop chavez goes to second on the wild pitch glavine swings away , and hits a little nubber right in front of the plate it s the same as a sacrifice chavez gets to third and glavine is thrown out by martin jose reyes has a chance to pick up an rbi he fouls off a couple of pitches , including a screamer that flies into the stands behind the mets dugout everybody is fouling off pitches tonight glavine has thrown 41 so far kuo , 45 reyes has seen seven in this at bat on the eighth he hits a bouncer to furcal who bobbles it , losing the slight chance he might have had to get chavez at the plate he throws reyes out by a fraction of a step run scores , mets lead 10 paul loduca smacks a fat fastball that flies over lofton s head in right and bounces over the wall for what john sterling would call a groundsrule double he s on second carlos beltran strikes out swinging , ending the inning but the mets are on top top of the third due up lugokuofurcal lugo hits a sharp grounder right at wright lugo , who can run , is out by five steps one out hongchih kuo may have once been an outfielder , but he doesn t look too comfortable at the plate three light swings and he s out two out second time around for the lineup now furcal sends an easy fly to center that beltran collars another easy inning for glavine quite a pitcher s duel so far side retired fox has a new twist on the showtheplayerswives and showthecelebrities appraoch to sports broadcasting they ve shown mia hamm , who is both a player s wife \( nomar s \) and a celebrity bottom of the second due up delgadowrightfloyd isn t it amazing how the guy who catches the ball to make the last out of the top half of the inning sometimes is the first to bat in the bottom half \? \? delgado lofts a little blooper that drops in front of lofton for the first hit of the game delgadowrightfloyd went 7 for 12 yesterday wright takes a called third strike on a slider down and in on the replay it looked inside one out , with delgado still on first floyd just took a called strike two it looked pretty low , and he looked pretty unhappy fox is playing up the coincidence that two taiwanese pitchers kuo and chienming wang of the yankees grew up in the same town and , in the last 38 hours , pitched in the same town in the mlb playoffs they have time to talk about that because floyd is on his eighth pitch so far the count is 2 and 2 now we re up to 10 pitches , and the count is full delgado swings and misses at the 11th pitch , which was a little high and tight two out jose valentin batting takes the first 3 pitches , all balls kuo brings it back to 3 and 2 , and valentin hits a soft liner to furcal at short side retired top of the second due up kentdrewmartin jeff kent , the former met , makes solid contact but lofts a fly to beltran in center one out jd drew grounds to reyes for another easy out glavine seems sharp so far two out russell martin is fouling off glavine s pitches he s thrown nine to him so far , and the count is 3 and 2 and glavine walks him on the 10th he was keeping the ball away , and martin refused to chase on the last pitch marlon anderson batting with martin on first a catcher , he could hardly be described as a threat to steal glavine gets anderson to hit a comebacker a soft throw to delgado and the inning is over bottom of the first due up reyesloducabeltran best wishes to pedro martinez , who had rotator cuff surgery today in manhattan hopefully we ll see him on the mound next summer hongchih kuo pitching for the dodgers his only career victory was here at shea this summer he s a lefthander who throws hard jose reyes strikes out swinging one out paul loduca slices off an 01 pitch and jd dreww makes an easy catch in right two outs carlos beltran pops up a 21 pitch that s caught by nomar easy inning for kuo , too top of the first nomar garciaparra hits a lazy 10 fly to chavez in right an easy 123 inning for glavine on a 32 pitch , kenny lofton hits a onebounce smash that david wright grabs going to his left two out furcal hits an easy grounder to reyes at short quick throw to delgado one out grady little seemed to be having some trouble with his lineup card , and came out to discuss things with the homeplate umpire , ted barrett a slight delay until he walks back to the dugout , satisfied rafael furcal fouls the first pitch off , and game 2 is underway ! the dodgers starting lineup is nearly unchanged from yesterday other than the pitching spot , the only change is julio lugo in place of wilson betemit at third base and in the no 8 spot ss rafael furcal cf kenny lofton 1b nomar garciaparra 2b jeff kent rf jd drew c russell martin lf marlon anderson 3b julio lugo p hongchih kuo the mets have one change as well endy chavez replaces shawn green in right , and bats eighth ss jose reyes c paul loduca cf carlos beltran 1b carlos delgado 3b david wright lf cliff floyd 2b jpse valentin rf endy chavez p tom glavine the weather tonight in flushing shouldn t be much of a factor mostly cloudy with temperatures in the low 50s and winds out of the northeast at about 10 mph the wind direction should be good news for fans at shea planes from nearby laguardia airport shouldn t be flying near the stadium on takeoff \( planes coming into laguardia might be nearby , but that shouldn t be nearly as earsplitting \) you can follow the action at laguardia here on deck at shea good evening and welcome to nytimescom s live batterbybatter coverage of game 2 of the national league division series , the new york mets vs the los angeles dodgers henry fountain here , blogging from a subterranean suburban location north of the whitestone bridge dylan mcclain will be taking a break from the chess board and moderating your comments , so post early and often the mets are looking to go twoup after taking the first game , 65 , wednesday afternoon the game was marked by solid performances by a bevy of mets pitchers , beginning with john maine , the emergency starter penciled into the lineup after orlando hernandez strained a calf muscle the game was also marked by one of the weirder double plays in postseason history , a baserunning blunder by the dodgers that resulted in two tagouts at home plate tonight s matchup features the mets tom glavine making his first postseason appearance not in an atlanta braves uniform , and the dodgers hongchih kuo , making his first postseason appearance in any uniform first pitch tonight is scheduled for 8 19 pm eastern once coverage starts , stay on top of developments by clicking refresh or by hitting f5 repeatedly to get the latest posts if you d like to make relevant comments about the game , please do so by taking advantage of the comments box below

my older son , gabriel , is in his room , propped up on elbows over a copy of ripley s believe it or not ! hey mom , want to see a picture of the man with fireproof skin \? i sit beside him and peer at the photo of a man who holds a torch to his body with no apparent repercussions awesome next , he shows me the smiling woman , arms knotted behind her back then another who writes her name with both hands simultaneously upside down and backwards wow like many 10yearolds , mine is fascinated by the amazing , strange , inexplicable , weird and all true found within these 500 pages who can blame him \? different is interesting different is cool but different can also be deeply troubling when it s happening to you last year , i had to label my son md \( multiply disabled \) , a broad classification for children with a combination of learning problems most recently , we changed the label to something beginning with the letter a the hardest thing i 'd ever done what is a , you wonder \? attention deficit disorder \? anxiety \? autism \? can we hold off a moment , please \? there s so much more to tell last march , the big yellow school bus stopped coming by our house instead , a small van now takes my boy off to a special school everything is different now so much is better the labeling game is a tricky one like any good parent , i wanted no part of it i intended to emphasize my child s strengths , not spend years studying his problems and repeating them over and over again to teachers , therapists and lawyers in order to get help years ago , i developed my own labels to explain my son s uniqueness gifted , scientist , voracious reader , dry wit , outoftheboxthinker , shy , creativeprobablyanartist and kind older brother but none of these labels could explain why such a bright child could not survive in a public school why , in kindergarten , he was alone at lunch why , in first grade , it seemed he was writing with paws rather than hands why , in second grade , he could not pay attention why , by third grade , he developed insomnia , became nauseous each morning , and said he would rather die than go to school and why , by fourth grade , he looked me in the eye one morning and said , teeth gritted , i am not going the only way to get him up would have been with a crane now that the van comes each day , we 've had an astonishing turnaround he calmly goes out the door , like , well , a norma i mean , a typical child he attends a class with 12 students , receives motivating points for good behavior , has successes and is accepted and respected for who he is suddenly , we are all feeling hopeful and whole again the label which i once feared and despised may have saved our lives of course , lots of people are skeptical about all these learning disabilities that have suddenly beset our society where did all this dyslexia , and add , and autism come from \? we did n't have all this stuff back then we turned out all right i'm not so sure what about the alcoholics , the chronically unemployed , the angry antisocial loners of the past \? what was at the root of their problems \? new developments in neuroscience and brain imaging now reveal that learning disabilities are not a fad , not an excuse , not a reflection of baby boomers' obsession with their children but the result of brain wiring that is different from typical brains sure , it s good to be skeptical about labels plenty of children with academic troubles do n't require classification , and most do n't need special schools diagnoses can be baffling and imprecise doctors do n't always agree \( ours sure did n't at first \) , and symptoms may be nebulous some fit , others do not like many children with learning difficulties , our son has a plateful of overlapping challenges it s hard to know which one is in charge some days , my guy does n't look like he has any of the a s but once we got a decent diagnosis \( one that fit at least most of the time \) , we began to cope we found the right people to help , and other parents who understood perhaps , most important , we began to forgive our son will have to work harder we 'll all have to work harder but we understand now that he is not lazy or naturally defiant , and his path will be unique in his book the misunderstood child , dr larry b silver , a clinical professor of psychiatry at georgetown , poignantly describes his own tortured experience having learning disabilities and writes that at least 10 percent of schoolage children have them our own psychiatrist makes a larger estimate he says , listen , there s a 50 percent chance you 'll get at least a little bit of something here he s talking about the whole gamut of psychiatric quirks , conditions and syndromes , not all of which even merit treatment but the idea is a comfort sort of like ripley s busting open our ideas of normal to a bigger and more accepting place complain if you wish about video games and the stresses of our modern world this is one area where we as a society are improving as we accept the big variety of human life gabriel , what do you think of the term 'learning difference' \? i think it s fair , he replies it s better than learning disabilities i hate that term it makes you sound like you 're mentally ill or something what do you think of the term asperger s syndrome \? i ask cautiouslyfor yes , this is his label , a neurobiological condition at the highfunctioning end of the autism spectrum symptoms range in intensity but include social difficulties , developmental delays , some quirky behaviors and , sometimes , great talents \( parents love to tell you that einstein and mozart probably had it , too \) you say i have this , he replies but i really have no idea what it means then he adds you know , it would have been much easier not to have all this i know i'm different but i do n't feel different at all , really it s just like i'm me most of the time i just try to act like normal do you mean typical \? ok , typical i try to act typical i only want to pay attention to my learning difference when i have to i ask for the twentieth time how he likes his new school i like it , he replies calmly and maturely i feel better i see that mine is n't the only problem some kids have it worse some have it better and , mom , you 've asked me enough now really , you do n't need to ask me again i do like it to tell you the truth , we 're feeling more typical each day yes , we 've got a lot ahead but it s time to give labels and worries a rest right now things are going well it s time to focus on the positives and his individuality , and the divine spark of how we never know where the future will lead no label can predict drawing \( drawing by alex nabaum \)
imagine a commuter railroad where the tracks are lined with palm trees , the cars are airy and spacious and a monthly ticket costs 80 , no matter how far you ride clearly , we are not talking about metronorth here on a recent visit to florida , i was introduced to trirail , which runs 72 miles between west palm beach and miami riding from delray beach to miami to visit a colleague gave me new perspective on my own daily commute and the relative merits of metronorth first , i was reminded of how much we have to pay to take the train to manhattan my roundtrip trirail ticket costs 850 , less than half what i 'd have to pay for an offpeak ticket on metronorth at 80 , the monthly ticket on trirail is roughly 26 percent of what i pay a study last year by california transit officials in preparation for a fare increase there found that the cost per mile traveled of a oneway ticket on metronorth was 23 cents the highest of any commuter railroad in the country by comparison , the long island railroad was 22 cents and new jersey transit was 16 cents and trirail \? a mere 8 cents but the disparity is even worse when viewed on a monthly basis on metronorth , the cost per mile of a monthly ticket was 477 again , the highest in the nation the long island was 449 and new jersey transit was 448 trirail was 113 , by far the lowest of any commuter railroad one big reason for the low fares in florida is that riders pay only about 26 percent of the railroad s operating cost the state and the counties pay the rest metronorth riders pay 56 percent but what do you get for your money on trirail \? the rail cars are a culture shock , like so many things in the sunshine state on the outside you wo n't find the allbusiness silver with the red or blue stripe trirail cars are blue , with a cloud pattern , palm trees and a multicolor trirail logo splashed across the middle to a northerner , they look as if they were designed by someone in a pi \? olada fog inside , the culture shock continues the cars are bilevel , so i headed for the upper deck and was stunned to see how spacious it was , with only two seats on each side of the aisle no dreaded middle seat the seats are in clusters of four , many with small tables in the center i saw commuters using the tables for their laptops , their lunch or for reading material but it was n't all soft breezes and mellow smiles my train arrived 20 minutes late in delray beach without any announcement of a delay and lumbered along from station to station , arriving in miami nearly a halfhour late to their credit , riders took this in stride none of them whipped out cellphones to announce that they would be late to some meeting or to reschedule an appointment moreover , there was no conductor to complain to only a security guard who checked to make sure everyone had a ticket on my return trip , there was n't even that you cannot buy tickets on the train in addition , trirail stations are all far from any urban center , even in fort lauderdale and miami , requiring a car or bus to get where you need to go that is largely a factor of trirail s history it began operations in 1989 on an existing freight line to ease congestion during construction on i95 in the new york area , all the cities built up around railroad stations , said joe giulietti , executive director of trirail down here , we 're trying to integrate a rail system around existing cities mr giulietti knows both railroads about as well as anyone can before moving to florida eight years ago , he spent 27 years at metronorth and its predecessors , holding a variety of jobs , including superintendent of the new haven line he said he took the job at trirail because of the challenge of developing a new railroad besides , he said it s a wonderful , wonderful place to live i do n't miss your ice storms and your snowstorms with the addition of a second track , he said , trirail plans to go to 40 trains a day , from the current 24 that compares with 621 on metronorth but in a state where cars rule , trirail still seems very much an afterthought , an alternative that only 10 , 000 people use each day , compared with 125 , 000 on metronorth in the end , i returned home with a new appreciation of metronorth the fares are high , the equipment is old and tired , and the riders are , by and large , silent and stressed out but it works , it s usually on time , and the region could n't function without it photo trirail links west palm beach and miami \( photo by jon bell presbyterian college \)
the second season of prison break , the fox hit that last spring saw eight convicts escape from the fox river penitentiary , has already been compared to many classics of the genre to the fugitive times eight , for example , or to the great escape in its form , to dickens s serialized novels , and in its premise , to the camus novel the stranger wade williams , who plays bellick , the prison guard with a heart of lead , has another idea i think it s like 'finding nemo , ' he said recently , sitting in a trailer on a broiling parking lot in this exurb north of dallas , where the second season is being filmed you know , when they all escape from the aquarium and they really are fish out of water verifying its provenance is only one of the problems that those involved with the show , which emerged as one of the most fascinating dramas of last season , have had another has been how to get the audience to buy into a concept where the traditional good guys the president , for example are bad and the bad guys like the loathsome murdererpedophile tbag have at least an inkling of goodness buried within then there was the issue of how to sustain a onetopic premise we 're bustin' out , tonight over 22 episodes and nine months in the new season , which begins monday , the storytelling challenges would seem to get only harder , as the main characters , who finally escaped in last season s finale , run in eight different directions but paul t scheuring , the series creator and head writer , is confident , for one main reason a lot of people , he said , are going to be killed the ramifications of this escape are going to be very obvious , in that we 're not going to try to sustain the show or kind of cheapen it in any way by trying to stretch too much out of the season , he said those eight guys who start on the ground running in season 2 , he added , virtually none of those will be there in their current iterations , involved in the season 3 story line for most shows , killing off a single character is a big deal it alters a show s dynamics , both onscreen and off , itself a risk for an enterprise that relies on the cooperation of the multiple parties on the set each day a character s death also risks alienating a fair portion of the audience , because each player in a complex drama is bound to attract his own set of fans other popular shows , like lost on abc , have centered large parts of their seasons on the occasional death of a character but despite the fact that there is no precedent for him to follow or avoid , mr scheuring seems almost blas \? s he invokes the right to pursue mass bloodshed we just want to tell the most intriguing and best story that we can , he said , and we ca n't pull any punches in doing that if we kill characters , and characters fall by the wayside , it makes the audience that much more fearful for our protagonists while they 're on the run , because they realize that they could get caught and killed the actors realize it too comfortable though mr scheuring may be , his approach has created a certain level of tension on the set , where the actors and crew are enduring 12hour days in temperatures that are routinely topping 100 degrees one of the actors here , he s about to eat it , and he s very upset , said dominic purcell , who plays lincoln burrows , the death row inmate who is wrongly accused of assassinating the vice president s brother it s a very sensitive subject a series like this comes along once in a while , and of course you want it to last as long as possible and just as clearly , some will be disappointed if everybody continues on in this safe world , then by episode 6 or 8 or 10 , you 're bored , mr scheuring said but if it s like , 'is scofield going to die at the end too \? ' he might , and i think that s cool scofield is michael scofield , the structural engineer who had himself incarcerated with a tattoo of the prison s blueprints to bust out his brother , the accused assassin that is only the beginning of the show s convoluted plot the vice president s brother , it was revealed in last season s finale , is anything but dead , and the vice president is now the president after she appeared to have a hand in knocking off the big man herself and what would a prison drama be without a love interest \? not that kind although there is that too but rather a burgeoning flirtation between scofield and dr sara tancredi , the prison physician who happens to be the governor s daughter farfetched \? perhaps but the plot s credibility problems are overcome by rich , intense character portrayals , anchored by wentworth miller as the tattooed brother and robert knepper , who plays the repellent tbag with a creepy , insinuating grin the second season also adds a new antagonist , special agent alexander mahone of the fbi , portrayed by william fichtner as javert to scofield s valjean , mahone chases the prisoners along their intersecting crosscountry paths

to the editor your policy of assigning reviews to unbiased third parties has been violated by your assignment of a gman s life the fbi , being 'deep throat , ' and the struggle for honor in washington , by mark felt and me , to john dean \( may 7 \) it would be hard to imagine a reviewer more biased than dean he was convicted of a crime and disbarred as a result of both felt s investigation of watergate and his role as deep throat additionally , the book assigned for review deals sneeringly with dean s lack of integrity dean himself has written two books assessing the identity and motives of deep throat , both of which were proven embarrassingly wrong in light of the recent revelation of felt s role dean s bias has resulted in palpably false assertions in the review , the heart of which , ironically , is that felt has supposedly made factual errors in this book dean claims , for example , that , contrary to felt s assertion in our book , john ehrlichman and i were out of the white house at the time of l patrick gray s resignation in fact , gray resigned and was replaced on april 27 , 1973 , while dean and ehrlichman were employed in the white house until april 30 dean also states unequivocally that felt was wrong in writing that the white house was following the watergate investigation through l patrick gray in fact , dean himself , as white house counsel , received multiple fbi investigative reports from gray , as any informed observer knows finally , dean s claim that it is absurd to say daniel ellsberg had been briefed rests upon deliberate misreading felt claimed only that ellsberg had been briefed on the subject , which is the kissinger wiretaps generally , revealed in time magazine three months earlier , about which his lawyers had since been inquiring and not that ellsberg knew that he had actually been overheard the oleaginous dean s attempt to alchemize these provably false charges into mere technicalities engenders yet more falsity ehrlichman was influential with , and praised by , nixon through the end in fact , dean devoured a foothigh stack of fbi summaries , 302 and airtel investigative reports , which he often kept on his desk , admitting in blind ambition that on a park bench , i told gray i needed the materials to keep track of the investigation s progress in any case , felt s work is proven not to be riddled with errors someone else s , though , is because dean s accusations of inaccuracy are at the core of his criticism of the book , they cannot be dismissed as inconsequential accordingly , dean s obvious bias has sullied , actually and substantially , the integrity of the review process john d o'connor san francisco john dean replies john o'connor claims i am biased against mark felt , so i wrote a review falsely claiming his book with felt has errors i do confess a bias toward honest history , but i have none toward mark felt in fact , when it was revealed that he was deep throat , i made highly favorable comments publicly , at a time when my former nixon white house colleagues were busy trashing him \( i publicly congratulated o'connor as well , but i stand by my deep throat sleuthing , for mark felt does not fit all the clues found in all the president s men \) as for felt s sneering , since he does it to everyone in the nixon white house , and he is deeply confused about the facts , i did not take it personally o'connor asserts that felt s investigation of watergate and his role as deep throat are reason for my bias , but he could not be more wrong the historical record \( testimony and nixon tapes \) show that after trying to persuade my colleagues to end the watergate coverup which was not being investigated by the fbi at the time , for only the senate watergate committee was exploring it as a potential matter of misconduct i went to the united states attorney s office on my own initiative to end the coverup felt had nothing whatsoever to do with my decision as for deep throat , according to all the president s men , he never mentioned my name until april 16 , 1973 \( after i had been dealing with the prosecutors for several weeks \) , and then he gave woodward totally false information about me , like claiming i had talked with senator howard baker , who was in the bag which was untrue and that nixon personally threatened to send me to jail if i told the prosecutors about national security matters which was also untrue the distortions in o'connor s letter , in which he misstates what i wrote in my review and uses his misstatements to assert i have falsely accused the book of being in error , necessarily require a bit of explanation in my review i wrote felt , who was passed over for the director s job , claims that in the period after gray s departure from the fbi , he 'knew that as long as john dean and john ehrlichman were in the white house , ' he 'would have less chance of receiving the appointment than the man in the moon' but ehrlichman and i were out of the white house at that time note , however , how o'connor has twisted my words , writing dean claims that , contrary to felt s assertion in our book , 'ehrlichman and i were out of the white house at the time' of l patrick gray s resignation \( emphasis added because i did not mention gray s resignation \)
by 11 am yesterday , barry bonds had n't heard the news on this , the final day of a disappointing season , bonds , baseball s second greatest home run hitter , sat in front of his dressing area , watching his beloved 49ers get shellacked by the kansas city chiefs bonds was n't aware that names had been disclosed in connection with the continuing peril of the use of human growth hormone in yesterday s editions , the los angeles times reported that roger clemens was among six players named by a former teammate as using performanceenhancing drugs none of the players was named barry bonds the article said the former major league pitcher jason grimsley also identified andy pettitte , miguel tejada , brian roberts and jay gibbons as players who used performanceenhancing drugs the big fish in these allegations and they are only allegations is clemens , perhaps the most dominating pitcher of his generation i'm not sure how i expected bonds to react to the news indignation \? a sense of satisfaction \? bonds arched his eyebrows in surprise and not much else that s awful , he said , and let it go at that it is awful , and infuriating , that the hypocrisies of two industries baseball and news media are converging baseball , if it did n't encourage drug use , at least looked the other way season after season as players did what they it had to do to make it through 162 games the news media , selectively picking and choosing who to vilify , has been on a bonds hunt for two seasons now it may be confronted with clemens if i know my industry , there will now be calls for restraint , for withholding judgment there will be calls for evenhandedness , for letting it play itself out , following the truth where it leads right this hunt has never been about getting at the larger truth , never about purging , going back and finding out how baseball helped perpetuate a culture of amphetamines instead , we 've witnessed a typically american approach to solving deepseated problems denial first , finding a scapegoat , initiating a public chase , holding an equally public execution and subsequently declaring the problem over bonds was supposed to be that scapegoat the problem is that the loose string we 've grabbed and pulled is undressing an entire industry , dredging up names never intended to be dredged up clemens and pettitte , teammates with the yankees and the astros , denied the allegations i just think it s incredibly dangerous to sit out there and just throw names out there , clemens said yesterday before the astros played in atlanta he added i 've been tested plenty of times my physicals i 've taken , they have taken my bloodwork i have passed every test again , i just find it amazing that you can throw anybody out there pettitte said he was stunned by the report i played with grimsley for a couple of years in new york and had a great relationship with him , pettitte told reporters pettitte said he never used any performanceenhancing drugs i do n't know what else to say except to say it s embarrassing my name would be out there , he said indeed the moving finger writes and having writ , moves on before yesterday s game , giants manager felipe alou noted , the minute your name comes out , even if it s not true , your name came out it s nice to go home clean in june , federal agents searched grimsley s home in arizona after he admitted using human growth hormone , steroids and amphetamines grimsley was released by arizona and suspended by major league baseball alou , who may be on his way out as the giants' manager , was asked what he thought of the new set of disclosures i was shocked to see some of the names on television this morning , alou said there are some big names i said , 'here we go again' can you imagine having to go through another year \? you believe the season is going to be behind us , the season is over and all of that is behind now it s in front of us alou predicted that more names more big names will surface as federal agents dig and dig in their attempt to get bonds the battleground is filling up with casualties in pursuit of bonds , the san francisco chronicle published a story based on documents obtained from a grand jury now two of its reporters face prison time more bigname athletes will have their reputations tarnished meanwhile , bonds , the target in all of this , is sitting in front of his stall , watching a football game what fitting symmetry to a baseball season that began with bonds hounded by suspicion of steroid use , despite never testing positive the season ends with big names other than bonds being implicated by a former teammate now the mob that has pursued bonds with a singleminded vengeance must decide whether to pursue clemens and pettitte as well asked whether he thought the news media will go as hard after clemens as it has after bonds , alou said first of all , it has to be true we do n't know if that is true but i gotta say though , he said , smiling , that rockets are hard to catch baseball deserves this we deserve this photo roger clemens with his strength coach , brian mcnamee clemens was among six players named in a los angeles times article as using performanceenhancing drugs \( photo by steven senne associated press \)
need a little break from the bcs bashing and critiquing the giants \? here s some meaningless entertainment \( \? \) in the form of pseudogame tracking of a key fantasy football matchup between commish and mr samkon gado watch final sgw 87 , commish 74 it was a strong effort by westbrook , but it was not strong enough barring another overnight scoring adjustment , he totalled 20 points , with 68 rushing yards , 6 receptions for 56 yards and a touchdown he was given two chances inside the 12 to score late in the fourth , but gained a net total of 0 yards and the eagles kicked a field goal so good luck in the semifinals next week mr sgw you ll need it since you re playing ladainian tomlinson at least i didn t lose by 11 or less , which is how many points i left on my bench so i am comforted by the notion that my lineup decisions did not lead to my loss and sometimes that s all you have in fantasy football halftime sgw 87 , commish 67 the evening was not looking so great for me or brian westbrook for much of the first half in philadelphia he wasn t getting much room to run , but he had a touchdown reception with two minutes left in the half to give him 13 for the game i take solace in the fact that the eagles are playing from behind i do not take solace in the fact that the eagles quarterback is jeff garcia update due to an overnight scoring adjustment , commish now trails sgw , 8754 the scoring wizards gave ben s defense , the bears , 4 additional points , for a whopping total of 26 for some reason i thought getting a 31point game out of brian westbrook seemed doable but 33 points seems impossible but i refuse to concede even though ben is already proclaiming victory so join me this evening \( if you re extremely bored \) , as i follow westbrook s adventures our league s score is as follows 6 points per touchdown 2 points per 2point conversion 1 point for every 10 yards rushing 1 point for every 20 yards receiving 1 point per reception 1 bonus point for a 50 yard touchdown 1 bonus point for 100yard rushing or receiving minus1 point for a lost fumble earlier this season , we wrote about the monday night hail mary do you have any good monday night comeback stories \?

with the legislature facing a selfimposed deadline of nov 15 to come up with proposals to reduce property taxes , there have been a few signs of progress in the last two weeks few being the operative word sure , one special committee dedicated to the property tax effort debated actual legislation on wednesday about folding some towns into neighboring communities to save money but both the ruling democratic party and the opposition republicans are dropping strong hints that their efforts will most likely fall short of expectations , so they are already engaging in a preemptive blame game it started on sept 27 , when the assembly minority leader , alex decroce , dismissed the property tax committees as a colossal waste of time in a news release , the democrats fired back , offering what they described as today s 'colossal waste of time' nominee republican efforts to sell their 30in3 property tax 'plan' to new jersey taxpayers maybe misfired is a more apt description of what the democrats did , because only political insiders would remember that 30in3 refers to the plan advocated by douglas r forrester , the republican candidate for governor last year , to reduce property taxes by 30 percent over three years later , assemblyman guy r gregg , a republican from sussex county , said that the democrats had promised in 2001 to cut property taxes as best i can tell , the democrats who campaigned in 2001 on lowering property taxes put up a white flag of surrender the day they took office , he said in fact , they did n't just surrender , they switched sides and did everything in their power to help increase property taxes then it got personal and weird after assemblyman richard a merkt , a republican from morris county , accused assemblyman wilfredo caraballo , a democrat from essex county , of failing to pass ethics reform , mr caraballo criticized mr merkt for failing to mention property tax reform once in his 666word news release , which he said was more meandering than a country road mr caraballo was soon joined by a fellow democratic assemblyman , reed gusciora of mercer county , in what may go down as the oddest statement of the year mr gusciora urged that there be a protect us from merkt rule for the sake of the public and general security , it may be time for the assembly republicans to issue only plastic eating utensils to assemblyman merkt at their next caucus meeting , he said so far , anyway , new jersey residents are having none of this in a rutgerseagleton poll released thursday , 70 percent said it was unlikely that the legislature would succeed in lowering property taxes significantly the potential silver lining , though , is that if nothing happens , trenton will be positioned for the ultimate punt creating a citizens' convention to get something done photo alex decroce
we were not the first mother and daughter to be arguing over an inheritance i do not feel you have the right to make decisions for my children and my sister s children , and for our children s children , my daughter elisabeth wrote to me i imagine myself as a mother and i know that i would have chosen a very different way of handling the great treasure you were given this battle was not about money , or jewelry , or real estate we were at odds over faded pieces of paper , a precious archive of letters and photographs that were mailed to my mother , sala kirschner , during her five years in nazi slave labor camps she had kept the secrets of these letters for nearly 50 years , breaking her silence only when she was about to undergo cardiac surgery in 1991 until the day she gave me the letters , neither my father , a gi from new york who met the beautiful young survivor named sala garncarz soon after liberation , nor my two brothers knew any more than i did about her once large family , her experiences in the camps or the hundreds of letters that she preserved at great risk my mother recovered from the surgery in the following years , through close reading of the letters and our many conversations , i became acquainted with sala as a young girl , a daring teenager who volunteered for a sixweek posting to a nazi labor camp , taking the place of her sister raizel in the belief that she would get to see something of the world beyond sosnowiec , poland sala s six weeks stretched into five years raizel was her most faithful correspondent in more than a hundred letters , she cherished , admonished and soothed her youngest sister , until raizel , too , was deported , and then nearly killed on a 280mile forced march in the winter of 1945 i also found dozens of love notes from an ardent suitor named harry haubenstock , who gave sala his baby pictures and managed to have a photograph of the two of them taken inside the labor camp there were 31 letters from her friend and mentor ala gertner , whose strength , optimism and intelligence seemed to leap off the pages ala was not only my heroine , but also an important historical figure in 1945 , just three weeks before liberation , she was hanged at auschwitz , one of four women punished for smuggling gunpowder that fueled the only armed uprising at the camp for 10 years , i researched the story behind the letters at the same time , together with my husband , i navigated a complicated life with our three children and two careers i tried to strike a reasonable balance , but sometimes the letters drifted to the back of my mind besides , i was not exactly sure what to do next with them my aunt raizel s death in 2002 jolted me awake for too long , the letters had languished in my closet , nearly as silent they had once been in my mother s house sala had been motivated by fear that the weight of her sad history would compromise her new life in america or poison her children make us somehow not normal as time passed , we no longer needed that protection my next step became obvious finding a permanent home for the collection with my mother s permission , i consulted dozens of libraries and museums and eventually agreed to donate the original letters to the new york public library news of the decision set off a storm of opposition from my children in their view , these letters must never leave the family the needs of nameless strangers , whether historians or the general public , were none of their business they rejected any concern about the physical preservation of the archive , vowing that they would learn how to take care of the delicate papers my proposal to give them high quality digital copies elicited their deepest scorn , as if technology could substitute for the real thing my daughters grew so hot in their objections that one night i took the letters from their usual place and hid them in an empty suitcase , feeling absurd , yet genuinely anxious about thieving children their siege led to unforeseen revelations my father revealed in 2004 that he , too , had a box of letters , bigger than bubbe s , he boasted and it was indeed a bigger box , crammed full of his wartime correspondence within this second box , we eventually found another 56 letters and documents including a diary that sala had kept in the first few weeks of her imprisonment \( why these had been separated from the others remains a mystery \) with the help of this new discovery , we reached a compromise although almost all of the letters became part of the new york public library s permanent collection , i retained enough to give one to each of sala s children , her grandchildren and greatgrandchildren on the night before we delivered the original letters to the library , my daughter caroline turned over each one , as if saying goodbye to a dear friend forever i had been caught unawares in some strange mutation of the echo boom at the very moment that i defined a path for myself , my children came of age as thirdgeneration survivors , confronting their grandmother s history , claiming it and demanding their independence their campaign forced me to acknowledge that more than a little egotism had crept into my decisions over the years my mother had given her letters to me , but my exclusivity was limited it had taken me more than a decade to solve the mysteries of what happened to the nearly 80 correspondents who had written to sala , and to answer the questions of how and where she had received these letters i had taken an active role in the planning of the first public exhibition at new york public library , and i wrote the first book on the letters , sala s gift , which was also my first book yes , i had certainly earned the distinction of being the storyteller with special standing but i would not be the only one the voices of the letters called to me not only because they led my family out of the shadows but also because they emanated from rare historical documents a bridge to history , a time capsule , the letters opened up a direct encounter with my mother s past raw and powerful in their immediacy , the writers' words , even their handwriting , exposed the gradual disintegration of individual lives now my children were listening carefully , not only hearing the darker notes , the heartrending grief of mothers , fathers and children , the sounds of holocaust and war , but also the poignant and unforgettable messages of hope , love and humanity that sustained one young girl photo legacy top

are liberals wrong to spend so much time worrying about the bogeyman of religious conservatism \? in a wall street journal oped that was published last week and posted on the journal s free opinionjournal site over the weekend , ross douthat , an associate editor at the atlantic , suggests that socalled theoconservatism is the closest thing to a credible public philosophy the gop has to offer moreover , douthat writes , theoconservatism is not a radical break from america s historic separation of church and state rather , the religiousconservative movement fits comfortably into the rich american tradition of a religioninfused politics contemporary theoconservatism is best understood as an heir to america s long line of christhaunted reform movements the abolitionists and the populists , the progressives and the suffragettes , the civilrights crusaders and even the antiwar activist of the middle 1960s , among whom richard john neuhaus \( now the theocon in chief to his enemies , but then a man of the religious left \) cut his teeth like the victorian reformers who strove to mitigate the worst consequences of the industrial revolution , religious conservatism , at its best , is a response to the excesses of the sexual revolution the fatherless children and broken homes , the millions of abortions and the commodification of human life the eras aren t parallel , but there are similarities the victorian reformers passed the laws against abortion that theocons yearn to restore , and waged war against the same kind of crude , politicized darwinism that s associated with the contemporary culture of death the republican party scandals have left the members of the theocon wing \( as opposed to the neocon wing \) relatively unsullied , douthat argues , and stronger , in numbers and credibility , than most of their rivals for control of the party but for the thecon moment to arrive , he writes , religious conservatives must distance themselves from jowly bigots like pat robertson and jerry falwell instead , they need to appeal to the political middle , by pursuing a strategy of incrementalism this probably means being willing , in a possible post roe world , to ease in regulations on abortion slowly and with relatively mild penalties , rather than leaping immediately to a ban even in cases of rape and incest , as south dakota recently did it means focusing energy on issues that have the potential to expand your base as vouchers and school prayer do , say , with africanamerican voters rather than on controversies that shrink it , like crusades against std vaccines or gay teletubbies it means avoiding the temptation to federalize issues , like gay marriage and the fate of terri schiavo , that most americans would prefer be kept local if religious conservatives fail to moderate their political language and aims , they will end up less like the abolitionists and more like a far less successful movement in american history , douthat writes it would consign them to a place in history alongside the populists , another movement that burned brightly but then guttered and went out , with its most ambitious goals unfulfilled and its greatest spokesman , william jennings bryan , reduced to a figure of bienpensant mockery for his opposition to evolution the intellectual backdrop for douthat s essay is a debate prompted by a new republic cover story written by former first things editor damon linker , who criticized current first things editor and theocon richard john neuhaus as part of that conversation , linker has been posting in the comments section of douthat s blog , the american scene this post from douthat includes an excerpt from linker s response to the wall street journal oped linker , whose book the theocons will be published this fall , says that douthat s attempt at becoming less scary to the moody center of the political spectrum is just tactics and the end is the same the coercive imposition of catholicchristian moral absolutes on a modern nation currently lacking in a catholicchristian cultural consensus participating in the democratic process by running candidates for political office who then try to pass legislation is hardly a coercive imposition , douthat objects he writes of course the christian right has its share \( or more than its share \) of bigots and sexists , fanatics and fools , and of course there are people in the movement who are mainly in it for the chance to be busybodies , anxious to regulate their neighbor s private lives and bring the power of the state to bear in places where it doesn t belong with sodomy laws , for instance , or bans on contraception which was one of the points of my oped that after twenty years \( and all of the efforts , by neuhaus and others , to bring the movement into the mainstream \) , social conservatives still haven t shed a lot of their falwellrobertson bigotries and bad habits and they need to , both as a matter of tactics and because those bigotries and bad habits are , well , bad but none of this means that the religious right is wrong about the big political questions the fate of the family , the abortion rate , the impact of pornography , and the illegitimacy rate are all issues that serious christians should care about and the idea that they we should confine ourselves to writing sermons \( or blog posts \) exhorting people to be moral is just silly
it s been very busy lately , so my apologies for the lack of posts lately but in particular , i wanted to say something about am rosenthal , the former times executive editor abe died last week , and the funeral an incredibly moving one was sunday abe hired me , back in 1984 , and gave me my first couple of promotions my wife and i shared his interest in china and foreign affairs , and in human rights , and i m now using the office that he used when he was a columnist he could be caustic as a manager , i realize , but i never encountered that side of him , and he was certainly brilliant in presiding over the times for 17 years and modernizing it in ways that cultivated a new and younger audience the times was lucky to have a remarkable pairing of talent at the helm , for abe s boss as publisher then was punch sulzberger , a former marine who initially was underestimated when he took over as times publisher in his 30 s in fact , punch turned out to be an outstanding leader , and he took the gutsy step of backing abe up in the pentagon papers case , when both of them could have gone to jail or even conceivably witnessed the collapse of the newspaper itself likewise , punch gave abe the resources to rethink the times and start new sections like science times , and their partnership helped make this newspaper what it is today punch was an honorary pallbearer at abe s funeral my own favorite memory of abe rosenthal goes back to the summer of 1985 , when there was a party held by one of the young reporters i think it may have been esther fein , or perhaps betsy kolbert the party was in a dilapidated apartment on the upper west side , with people sitting around on couches that looked as if they d been rescued from the salvation army , and it was an entirely young crowd and then in walks abe he was such a journalistic giant , and so many strata above us , that none of us had conceived that he might show up but he spent the evening chatting and hamming it up and drinking incredibly cheap white wine with us , leaving us all with warm feelings about the family of the the new york times
because of a general belief among frequent business travelers that corporate flights are safer than going commercial , times are flush for companies like landmark aviation , which services private jets at least that is the way shawn vick , the company s president , explained its recent expansion into westchester , to a fixed base operation , or fbo , at the county airport landmark s customers believe they have a higher degree of security on corporate flights that they can control , mr vick said , pointing out another asset of fixedbase operations shorter waits and faster security clearances we 're a real timesaver for our corporate customers , he said , describing those clients as many fortune 2000 s who do business in and around the new york metropolitan area landmark , a yearold tempe , ariz , company , recently acquired skyport , a smaller company already operating out of the westchester airport , which is home to one of the largest corporate fleets in the country , according to lawrence c salley , commissioner for the county department of transportation the purchase gives landmark 34 fixedbase operations in the united states and canada , most of them in the southeast and texas the company , which also owns another nine maintenance centers throughout the country , was created by the carlyle group , a private equity firm in washington , from the merger of three aviation services companies garrett aviation services of tempe piedmont hawthorne of winstonsalem , nc and associated air center of dallas with the merger , landmark now employs 2 , 500 people it had 800 million in revenues in 2005 according to mr vick , it caters to the increasing number of corporations that fly their own jets or own fractional shares in such aircraft in its annual business aviation outlook last november , honeywell aerospace forecast a sharp increase in new businessjet sales in the coming years the industry recovery that began in 2004 gained momentum in 2005 , frank daly , an executive vice president for honeywell , was quoted as saying if current expectations regarding growth in us gross domestic product and the global economy hold , 2006 should be a record year for business jet deliveries , topping the previous peak in 2001 security and privacy concerns have corporations leery of identifying their operations hubs , said tom o'halloran , who regularly flies a 14passenger jet into the county airport for aim aviation , a private company for one such corporation but he did explain what might draw a corporate airline to a specific fixedbase operation a full range of services along with a competitive price on fuel , which can range from 365 a gallon to 575 a gallon , depending on the volume purchased at the end of the day it s about fuel , mr o'halloran said , but we also look for the whole package , including customer services for the executives who are our passengers roughly 50 percent of the county airport s 180 , 000 flights every year are made by corporations or timeshares , said mr salley , the county transportation commissioner the remaining flights are made by commercial airlines or by private owners of smaller aircraft in all , mr salley said , there are 87 corporateowned planes at the airport because of its proximity to new york city and connecticut , he added , the airport has become a major hub of corporate aviation especially since 9 11 , we 've seen a shift , mr salley said corporate and charter flights are on the increase , and because of the costs of insurance and fuel , general light aviation is decreasing meanwhile , the percentage of commercial flights has held steady in all , he said , more than a million corporate and commercial passengers were served last year as for landmark s future , mr vick explained that its acquisition of skyport was part of a larger plan to operate fixedbase operations at hubs throughout the united states with footholds already in syracuse , albany and rochester but none in new jersey or long island , the company would consider establishing such service centers at teterboro or morristown airport , he explained right now at those sites , it is relying only on mobile service centers westchester serves as a base for the mobile technician teams landmark , which also refurbishes corporate aircraft and installs new aviation technology , maintains an executive terminal and a pilots' lounge in white plains , where its ground services include interior cleaning , tiedowns , catering , deicing , and exterior washing and polishing of aircraft it plans to build a new passenger lounge in white plains for its customers and has already added more maintenance capabilities there the idea is that you could land in westchester and get everything done , mr vick said the landmark fixed base has longterm leases with the county on 80 , 000 square feet of hangar and office space its hangars accommodate 22 private and corporate jet aircraft under multiyear tenant leases , he said it will continue to employ skyport s 38 workers , but has no immediate plans for hiring more people photo mardo medina of landmark aviation works at westchester airport , where the

the jets look bad , changing general managers three weeks after hiring a coach this dysfunction could make the jets the worstrun sports franchise in the greater metropolitan area except , of course , for the existence of the knicks but the jets' spasmodic management turnovers could be far worse at least they had a legend tucked away in the front office , waiting for his opportunity for years , mike tannenbaum has been a mythic figure in football , a numberscruncher who arranged the contract that brought curtis martin to the jets in 1998 , with figures that satisfied the league s salary cap tannenbaum , who was named general manager yesterday , replacing the deposed terry bradway , has been clattering the abacus in some cubbyhole in the jets' gloomy bunker on long island you can find him on the internet by searching words like wizard and guru a lawyer with a background in sports and entertainment law , tannenbaum was famous within the national football league for being able to pay all these large people within the limits of the salary cap that takes imagination more than jets fans have seen in offensive formations since the days of joe willie namath occasionally , the jets would even let tannenbaum out in public we caught a glimpse of him in the spring of 2001 , when herman edwards remember herman edwards \? conducted a media day that included a seminar for reporters on salarycap intricacies tannenbaum not only explained the salary cap , he even made a wry little joke about the rapid turnover in pro football just suppose we had a coaching change , something that never happens with the jets \( this was after bill parcells and bill belichick , two of his mentors , and al groh had all come and gone in the span of four years \) the jets regarded tannenbaum as their secret weapon woody johnson inherited him when he bought the team six years ago , and quivered whenever it seemed tannenbaum might join parcells on one of his forays to yet another franchise tannenbaum was frequently described as a future general manager the other shoe dropped yesterday there will be various theories of blood all over the back corridors at jetland from infighting between bradway and tannenbaum over last month s hiring of eric mangini as coach tannenbaum and mangini are allies going back to their days with belichick in cleveland , so bradway will be perceived as the loser in a power struggle , and maybe he is but he was n't all that secure anyway yesterday , johnson and bradway referred to bradway s actually having a family life , in faraway atlantic city when billionaires start gushing about the joys of family life , you know something slippery has taken place if i had it to do over again , i 'd spend more time with my family , johnson said , as if he were doing bradway some huge favor bradway , hardly a public person , will become a consultant on player personnel , presumably spending more time at home he hugged me and told me he loved me like a brother , tannenbaum said about bradway , who spoke to reporters later it might have been better if they had hugged in public , but the story was believable now the question is whether a numbers guy can improve the jets if chad pennington s shoulder had not fallen apart again last season , none of this might have happened but the jets finished with a 412 record , and edwards split to kansas city after apparently annoying johnson with his contract demands tannenbaum alluded to a lot of great people in this building he invoked some of them , recalling , as herm would say , 'enjoy the journey , ' and quoting parcells as often saying you 're driving the train your job is to keep the train rolling every day promising to work 24 hours a day , tannenbaum said , you can improve your team in march from the canadian league or arena football , and you may win a game during the season he gave examples of recent successful teams winning with key players acquired outside the glamorous early rounds of the college draft my job is to get the head coach players , tannenbaum said it s easy to ridicule the jets for virtually starting over , after spending years and energy on the impractical and doomed west side olympic stadium ultimately , football is a sport of specialization one constant with the jets since 1997 , before even martin s time , has been their salarycap expert , tannenbaum , not exactly a boy wonder at 36 theo epstein won a world series at 30 with the red sox in 2004 , and brian cashman won with the yankees at 31 in 1998 the jets are starting over at least they are trying it with their own guru
to the editor re beirut mob burns danish mission building over cartoons \( news article , feb 6 \) the muslim world is up in arms about a cartoon in the name of islam , the world has endured hijackings , the burning of presidential effigies , the burning of national flags , antisemitic articles and cartoons in the arab press , the murder of 3 , 000 people on 9 11 , suicide bombings leading to many deaths of civilians around the world , and the kidnapping , torture and beheading of innocent victims , all conveniently captured on videotapes to further traumatize the rest of the world none of this has provoked so much as a yawn from the muslim populace is something wrong with this picture \? jane miness new york , feb 6 , 2006
the wrapup 9 6 it was a great game for eight innings so now the mets can enjoy a little yankee angst , going into a hostile stadium tied at 1 though of course it s not quite the same , the mets having the luxury of a sevengame series in any case , check in tomorrow , when joaquin andujar starts for the cards , dwight gooden takes the mound for the mets , and someone who s actually qualified to do this will presumably be providing your commentary here on the bats blog thanks for stopping by and thanks , carla , for keeping all the smut and threats of bodily harm off the board  thank you for joining the times bats blog this evening for a contest that , alas , falls into the category of foregone conclusion the cardinals wll probably show up at shea stadium , but they might as well not no team in the history of sports has ever come back from a 10 deficit in a bestofseven series at least , as far as i remember in truth , because of budget constraints i have no research assistant working with me this evening , so i ll be forced to make up most of the statistics i spew into this blog , including that one also , i haven t paid much attention to the national league ever since , as a young boy living in the philadelphia suburbs , i was psychologically scarred by listening to the phillies great collapse of 1962 , or was it 1964 hey , i told you , i ve got no research assistant and so my information may be a little out of date bottom of the ninth 9 6 delgado gives it a shot against tyler johnson and mails it in , striking out on five pitches apparently neil has left early like many of the fans at shea did not ! went to the oh , never mind how the heck did the game end in that amount of time \? \? somebody tell me ! ! pleeeeze ! top of the ninth , 6 6 billy wagner , professional closer , comes in for the mets and , as charlie bhe notes , a substitution la russa made earlier , replacing duncan with so taguchi , who bats righthanded , could pay off that s what they call good managing charlie , you are the man , in terms of baseball strategizing taguchi homers to left wow there s some baseball being played here this evening , and some baseball managing being practiced i m guessing it s kinda quiet over there at shea at the moment and albert doubles to left , though a good throw might have turned it into an out or kept it a single oh , endy , endy , endy , why have you let us down \? edmonds grounds out , which brings up the beard who actually used to be on my roto team back when he was young and promising you gotta be kidding me he doubles to right he s going to be the goddanged mvp of this game disgraceful none of my business , mets fans , but this guy is your closer \? up in the bronx we got this guy who we bring in late in games who actually gets people out a single by carnation drives in spezio this game is , for all practical purposes , over wagner , the former pride of tannersville , va , leaves to a hail of boos that i can hear all the way in times square , even though the sound s off on the tv molina hits a grounder that puts encarnacion in what may be the longest rundown in the history of postseason baseball \( can i get in one last plea for a researcher \? \) , and the inning mercifully ends but so much air went out of shea stadium and the mets in the last 15 minutes that weather patterns around the globe are being affected bottom of the eighth josh kinney comes in to pitch the tv guys are talking about what a great story he is , how he was a journeyman who was called up from some obscure minor league or semi pro or some such team , and now here he is in the playoffs which means that there s something really big at stake right now a disney movie contract and he s facing a pinchhitter julio franco , the oldest player in , well , ever who remembers what they were doing in april 1982 \? that s when franco made his major league debut eisenhower was president , and games were still broadcast by town crier , radio still being five years in the future franco strikes out ! just like in the rookie ! someone call dennis quaid ! but wait , hold on now he gives up a single to reyes , which means a double , which means the winning run will score before 10 45 catcher not named piazza walks , and carlos b steps up and grounds into a double play ! ! kinney gets a movie contract ! ! ! let s cast it robin williams as la russa top of the eighth all right , now this molina guy is just showing off he singles to left after whoever was up before him made an out of some kind those sluggin molinas ! i read that if this series goes on much longer the mets may actually start a pitcher with a 3 and 13 record and the cards , in that same article , were listed as having a guy named tba as their starter which leads me to a new game show rumor or no rumor roger clemens , now that he has discharged his obligations to houston , is negotiating with both teams make an appearance for them on a perpitch basis his agent is offering 30 pitches for 1 million or 50 for 2 million , but negotiations have reportedly stalled over the issue of whether pickoff throws count meanwhile , there s a cardinal on first with two outs and eckstein is up oh , yeah , now i remember it s molina on base and now he s on second thanks to a pitch so wild that even a molina could get to second on it but a groundout ends it on to crunch time bottom of the seventh , 6 6 pujols makes a fine play at first to retire , i dunno , probably green , and someone else made an out , and poor endy made a third out , which is apparently all you get somewhere in there valentin also got a single , which is noteworthy only because he hasn t had a hit since the clinton administration maybe i spoke too soon national league baseball is boring correction carla advises that in my earlier rant about hockey , the phrase should have been whom do i have to call to get the rangers out of new york , not who also , ozzie smith is not currently playing short for the cardinals , and his nickname when he was playing was the wizard of oz , not the gizzard of oz top of the seventh 6 4 eckstein leads it off and decides the best thing for his team and the people of st louis is for him to ground out to short endy handles a fly ball from whoever s up before pu the guy whose name i can t spell , and now albert steps in , a mere shell of the man who hit 143 home runs in the regular season and had so many rbi they stopped counting will he continue to let down his team , his city , his state , his division \? he is , we re told by the fox guys in the midst of an orgy of kudos , a very special player theory tv commentators praise of sluggers is doled out in reverse proportion to how well they re producing pujols gets a hit ! repeat pujols gets a hit ! and edmonds walks which brings up spezio with two on i swear , if this guy with the irritating facial hair becomes a hero for the cards , i will not be responsible for my actions spezio triples or possibly homers \( it s called a triple may or may not have cleared the fence \) somebody get me a razor and some burma shave i m going out to the stadium and take care of this goatee problem right now mota , who was pitching , is rewarded for giving up the gametyer with a hot shower heilman comes in for the third out all right , i m converted , at least for the night national league baseball rocks ! bottom of the sixth snappy snacks , are you still there \? are you really in ghana \? man , that is one strong radio signal love bruce wayne s suggestion below for female softball pitchers to be allowed in the major leagues in fact , either of these could use one if this series goes 5 games and i think most of them throw faster than some of these guys reyes has gotten on first somehow while i wasn t paying attention , which means he ll be on second soon and score soon after that and how about that suggestion earlier about a rule change to allow running of the bases in either direction \? would liven things up considerably well , i was close on reyes the catcher who isn t piazza doubles to left reyes scores , and this game is effectively over because no team in either league in the history of the game has ever come back from a tworun deficit with fewer than five innings to play that i can remember ok , i take everything back that i said about belliard he just made a jeterian play on a grounder way to go , ronnie bummer about your name delgado s up again anyone for a threehomer game \? carlos , apparently , decides the mets have all the runs they need he grounds out to ronald also , there was a pitching change in there somewhere eckersley replaced franco , or maybe it was gossage top of the sixth , 5 4 if i cared about the national league , i d have to say this would be a darned entertaining game certainly more entertaining than hockey speaking of which , who do i have to call to get the new york rangers to play somewhere other than in new york \? i hate this time of year because i seem to have a knack for getting off of work at the exact instant the hockey game finishes , which means my train home to new jersey is packed with either a unruly or b irate hockey fans some appear to have imbibed alcohol during the game how about a hockeyfanfree car , new jersey transit \? the guy whose name is spelled something like carnation instant milk products flies out , i think i wasn t really paying much attention anyway , there s one out molina singles , giving him more hits in this game than his brother had the entire time he was on my roto team the if i were chris carpenter contest is hereby canceled , since he has just been pinchhit for it s rodriguez pick your own first name a feliciano comes in to pitch and makes short work of whoever rodriguez might have even been a double play not sure all i know is there s commercials on bottom of the fifth 4 4 beltran pulls a puljos , as it s now being called 1 out while we re waiting for the other carlos to hit another home run , how about somebody help me finish writing this parody of the tim hardin song if i were a carpenter i ve done the first line if i were chris carpenter now you take it and , as predicted by your blogger moments ago , delgado homers to left you heard it here first , folks belliard i m telling you , it s that wimpy first name of his boots a grounder by wright and then the scrawny green singles two on , one out , under two minutes left on the clock this , one surmises , has the potential to be the pivotal inning except that valentin is up if this were the yankees , by the way , valentin being the 7 hitter , arod would be on deck in fact , now he d be up , since the v just flied out carla keeps yelling at me for misspelling pujhlos i need a researcher , dadgummit endy grounds out to end the inning i m sorry i had him immortalized in verse top of the fifth apparently there s a rule in this league that if some guy other than the pitcher bats , the pitcher can t play any more hardly seems fair but chad bradford is now pitching , a guy with no skin on the back of his right hand because his sidearm delivery is sooooo low that he leaves it on the mound ackk ! ! someone from my roto team has posted a comment ! please , tuck , please don t mention where i finished this year puljols , or arod , as he is now being called , grounds out meekly edmonds , who s playing with something resembling a concussion , almost hits another home run , but in fact it s a long out spezio does no better how do you fastforward this thing to get to some actual scoring \? bottom of the fourth , 4 , 4 endy , we barely knew ye he grounds out on what might have been the first pitch not sure , was eating pizza someone in the dugout is apparently reading this blog they send up michael tucker instead of the pitcher , maine tucker is rewarded by being hit with a pitch in , i think , the thigh that s gonna sting reyes ground into a near doubleplay but he s too darn fast and makes first they ought to make these fast guys carry weights or something la duca makes it a moot point by grounding out 4 2 4 after 4 correction the description of albert puljos s most recent atbat on this blog was actually from the natural by bernard malamud so sue me top of the fourth molina stands in , still named yadier had one of his brothers on my rotisserie team in 2005 benji , jose , fredo , can i get a researcher here please \? but dumped him this molinda flies out to right one out i ask again why are these pitchers batting \? they don t do that in the league i usually watch research has shown conclusively that pitchers can t hit carpenter proves it again by popping out on tv they re talking about whether chris duncan carries a burden of expectations because he s dave duncan s kid lo duca , apparently distracted by their blabbering , throws the ball into center when eckstein , who got on base somehow when i wasn t paying attention , tries to steal second runner on third , two outs but duncan , nearly crushed under the parental burden , strikes out which , considering the way maine is pitching , is close to a miracle inning over bottom of the third i understand we have a commentator from canada this evening congratulations , canada , on finally getting the internet ! what is this shoetop camera shot fox is using \? some kind of weird product placement for nike \? i ve lost track of who s up , but i ve got a 2in9 chance of being right if i guess it s a carlos anyway , somebody made an out and somebody reached first , and some kinda scrawny looking guy is up oh , the scrawny guy in green hey , canada , didn t he used to play for the blue jays \? in fact , didn t practically all of these soon to be world champion mets used to play for the blue jays \? do they even still have a team up there \? scrawny green walks , but valentin hits into a double play still 44 going to , well , whatever inning we re going to geez these baseball games are long top of the third 4 2 duncan strikes out , and big albert puljols steps in he stands at the plate lean and loose , righthanded with an open stance , knees relaxed and shoulders squared the bat he holds in a curious position , lifted slightly above his head as if prepared to beat a rattlesnake to death maine , apparently a snakelover , walks him edmonds , apparently eager to get home for deal or no deal , doesn t waste a lot of time before blasting a home run it s a tie game superdave down on the posting board thinks maine is pitching fine randolph , however , doesn t he s on the phone , and probably not calling for pizza spezio walks just speaking theoretically , what would the likely punishment be if the mets sent some scrub out with a razor and gave him a forced shave \? a game or two suspension \? certainly no more than alomar got for spitting on the umpire all those years ago it d be worth it in fact , the crowd would give the scrub a curtain call encarnacion flies out , and so does belliard , but of course the horse has left the station , or the bats have left the barn , or whatever that expression is is that bat expert still online \? help us out here what s it called , batwise , when you ve already given up the tying home run but then go on to retire the side \? belatedly , part 2 another half a lineup , this one the mets' reyes ss lo duca c beltran cf delgado 1b wright 3b green rf valentin 2b chavez lf maine p bottom of the second , 32 mets endy chavez hits a breaking ball barely fair down the line in right for a double and how cool a name is endy \?

reported cases of lyme disease in the metropolitan region rose sharply in 2005 , according to health officials , with increases of 34 percent in connecticut , 23 percent in new jersey and 9 percent in new york state but some counties showed declines westchester had 458 reported cases , a decrease of 39 percent from 2004 on long island , suffolk county , with 542 cases , declined 3 percent , while nassau county , with 122 cases , had an increase of 107 percent fluctuations in case numbers are common , officials said , and the causes are difficult to pinpoint connecticut s increase last year , to 1 , 810 cases , is right within what we 've been seeing historically for the past 15 years , said randall nelson of the infectious disease division of the state department of public health there s variation from year to year contributing factors are food supplies for deer and rodents , which carry the ticks that spread the disease weather \( ticks have a twoyear life span and flourish during warm , wet winters \) and human activity , including prevention efforts and disease reporting midmay to early july is peak season , when about 90 percent of cases are transmitted , officials said the disease often causes a bull seyeshaped rash near a tick bite it can spread through the body if left untreated , causing arthritis , cardiac irregularities and neurological problems reported cases have been increasing over the last decade , experts say , partly because of greater awareness of the disease there s either a real increase or an increase in recognition , and it s probably a combination of both , said dr steven e phillips , the immediate past president of the international lyme and associated diseases society the disease was first identified in the 1970 s in lyme , conn , thus giving it its name another expert , eddy bresnitz , the state epidemiologist in new jersey , where 3 , 372 cases were reported in 2005 , cited the increased proximity of humans to wildlife there s more and more suburbia constructed closer to parks and areas where there s increased vegetation , he said we have more deer and more deer ticks anyone who walks through leaf litter in the woods or on the edge of fields or lawns this time of year should check regularly for the nymphal stage of the tick , said durland fish , a professor of epidemiology at the yale school of medicine the size of a poppy seed , the tick spreads 95 percent of cases , dr fish said some prevention efforts appear to be working in hunterdon county in new jersey , the rate of reported cases fell almost by half , to 268 per 100 , 000 residents in 2005 from 554 in 1996 for comparison , the rate of lyme disease nationally in 2005 was 67 cases per 100 , 000 people , and it is 274 in the 12 eastern and midwestern states where it is most common , according to the centers for disease control and prevention hunterdon experienced an increase in the number of cases in the 1990 s after the completion of a section of interstate 78 in western new jersey in 1968 led to housing construction and more people moving into deer habitat , said john w beckley , director of the county health department he said some of the recent decline in lyme disease in the county might be attributable to public health efforts that included putting signs in county parks warning visitors to check for ticks distributing fliers about the disease to doctors' and veterinarians' offices , garden centers and schools and publishing a lymeometer in a local newspaper announcing the level of tick danger each week dr andrea gaito , a rheumatologist in basking ridge , nj , in neighboring somerset county , said in midmay that she was already seeing three to four new cases of lyme a week there s more awareness , that s what brings people in early , and that s the good news , she said it makes early diagnosis and treatment so much better as a result , she said , she is seeing fewer cases of chronic lyme disease , which she estimates account for 15 to 20 percent of cases kim uffleman , 49 , of rivervale , nj , in bergen county , suffers from the chronic form of the disease , which she contracted 17 years ago nine months after being bitten by a tick , she was bedridden , and it was two years before ms uffleman , who used to run almost 50 miles a week , could leave her house without help it took her too long , she said , to find a doctor who could give her a clear diagnosis , even though she had had the classic bull seye rash i grieve the loss of my health , and that i had to raise three children while being extremely ill , she said they know nothing except for a sick mother , and that s very difficult she still has headaches , back pain , fatigue , numbness in her hands and burning pain down her arms pat smith , president of the lyme disease association , a national nonprofit group based in jackson , nj , said her group had helped develop two bills now before congress that would provide 100 million for research , education and prevention , in part to develop a definitive diagnostic test people who receive an early diagnosis and treatment with antibiotics generally recover and do not develop chronic symptoms but diagnostic tests have only been about 50 percent accurate , ms smith said , adding that she has seen an increase in chronic cases since the disease was identified , because as the number of cases grows , the number of undiagnosed , misdiagnosed and slowly treated cases has also grown some people have to go to dozens of physicians before they get diagnosed , and people are getting delayed or inappropriate treatments , she said linda davis , 42 , of freehold , nj , in monmouth county , had misdiagnoses of multiple sclerosis and fibromyalgia , among other ailments , before learning she had lyme disease in 2003 she was using a wheelchair when she finally started receiving proper treatment her sons , austin hutcherson , 8 , and myles hutcherson , 6 , also have the disease none of us had the bull seye rash , she said after receiving antibiotics , they are all doing better , though they still have symptoms austin has gastrointestinal problems , and myles has chronic fatigue we try to keep everything normal , she said they 're always playing outside most people do n't even know they have lyme disease ms smith said the lyme disease association was also raising money for an endowed research center at columbia university devoted to chronic lyme disease and supported research into the genome of borrelia burgdorferi , the bacteria that causes lyme disease researchers at the university of medicine and dentistry of new jersey in newark are determining the genetic structure of 17 strains of the bacteria , with help from researchers at the institute for genomic research in rockville , md , stony brook university and the university of utah one new jersey researcher , dr steven schutzer , said , knowing the genetic sequence will help in diagnostics , and possibly different kinds of therapeutics despite concerns about the disease , mr beckley , the hunterdon county health officer , urged people to enjoy the outdoors you can go on as many hikes as you want through the woods , but stay on the path , he said if you must go off the path , you should tuck your pants in your socks , he said , and use insecticides or insect repellent and check for ticks on yourself , your children and pets after being outside photos kim uffleman , shown with her dog , topaz , has had chronic lyme for 17 years a sign at mine brook park in flemington , nj , warns hikers

about midway through his speech during a town hall meeting at monmouth university here to discuss the state budget , gov jon s corzine pointed out as if anyone needed reminding that the number of days were dwindling until he presented his budget on march 21 then , he deadpanned , you all have about 1 , 412 days if you want to decide to get my tail out of office there was sustained laughter in the packed pollak theater , and the moment on wednesday night seemed to confirm the adage that humor is truth perhaps more than any other factor , mr corzine s appeal to voters in this fiscally troubled state was his wall street pedigree and his business acumen and more than any other move that he has made so far , what mr corzine presents in nine days as his solution to the state s budget woes will both shape the crucial first year of his term and perhaps help define his early prospects for reelection although it may seem premature to say that mr corzine faces a political moment of truth 63 days into his term , the intensity with which the governor has tried to untangle the state s 45 billion deficit suggests that he sees it as precisely that besides three successive nights of town hall meetings across the state to discuss the budget , mr corzine has been combining behindthescenes work to close the state s shortfall with a quiet but deliberate campaign to sell what he has called tough choices \( read tax increases \) to new jerseyans mr corzine has been referring to the shared pain required by residents to fix the budget practically since election night and through a succession of news conferences and oneonone sessions with reporters , he has ratcheted up the prospect that new or increased taxes are in order he also seems to embrace the perception that his business background may help him solve the state s shortfall although that may only raise expectations and increase the blowback if the deficit fix comes up short if nothing else , mr corzine has been frank though at times melodramatic in describing the budget when he told the audience at monmouth that the state s woes stemmed from years of spending more than revenue brought in , someone in the audience yelled amen we 've been getting bills and we 've either been putting it on credit cards and using credit cards to pay credit card bills and even more simply put sometimes we 've been putting the bills in the desk drawer and forgetting about them , and they come back to haunt you , he said still , there is the question of whether mr corzine has the will to impose the kind of tax increases to make a sustainable difference in the budget the governor did little to bolster his political braveheart credentials with his plan to rescue the transportation trust fund , which helps to maintain it s the state s roads and bridges mr corzine s plan refinances 18 billion of the trust s debt , a move that would add a billion dollars of debt over the next three decades instead of the refinancing plan , mr corzine could have chosen to raise the state s 105centsagallon gasoline tax , which helps finance the fund and is one of the lowest in the nation while there has been speculation that mr corzine declined to raise the gas tax to soften the blow of other increases , some argue that the move , particularly from a governor regarded for his financial acumen , does not suggest a new era of fiscal responsibility or political nerve it certainly does n't bode well for the wherewithal to deal with some of the tough decisions , dr joseph r marbach , a political scientist at seton hall , said of the trustfund rescue plan it smacks of the budgetary gimmicks that have really been practiced by every administration the governor s aides insist that the refinancing plan is sound because it solely applies to capital investments bridges , roads , transit infrastructure and will not allow the fund to be used for operating expenses like washing buses assemblyman louis d greenwald , chairman of the budget committee , deflected criticism of the borrowing plan and cautioned against drawing conclusions about how the governor may deal with the deficit based on the trustfund experience jon corzine has had tremendous success in private life , mr greenwald said we 're in great hands dr marbach wonders whether those hands may be forced to deal with the prickly tax issue because of the state s tumultuous recent history with chief executives since christie whitman left the governor s office in 2001 to join the bush administration , none of her three successors has served longer than 34 months because each had considered running for reelection , dr marbach theorizes , none of them seriously considered increasing taxes the attitude was , 'why bother with this \? ' dr marbach said 'i 'll leave it for the next guy' that perspective might be steeped in the fate of former gov jim florio , who after raising taxes was defeated by ms whitman significant tax increases is something we might see in the second term , dr marbach said , when corzine has nothing to lose as luck would have it , mr corzine s message last week was largely muted by the disclosure that he had lent a former campaign staff aide 5 , 000 to bail herself out of jail shortly after the monmouth gathering , mr corzine met with reporters who peppered him with questions about the loan at one point , jim hooker of new jersey network , said , governor , can i ask you one other thing on the taxes \? sure , the governor said quickly , i 'd love to photo

at 8 30 on a recent morning in west windsor , nj , ken anderson was sitting behind the wheel of his car , waiting patiently for a train to pull into the princeton junction station from new york he was not picking anyone up in what has become part of his daily hourlong commute into manhattan , mr anderson was staking out reverse commuters so he could grab a parking spot there s usually one or two people who get off the train and into their cars , and when one of their spots opens up , i make my move , said mr anderson , 34 , of hightstown , nj , who works as an accounts payable supervisor at atari to have any chance for a parking spot , you have to get here before 6 30 in the morning or after 8 for me , parking every day is an adventure earlier that morning , kristan flynn , a 34yearold research associate who lives in princeton , five miles from the station , sped into the parking lot on her bicycle no place to park , she said even the bike racks are nearly all full more than 7 , 000 people board commuter trains each day at the princeton junction station , but there are only enough parking spaces for about half of them , according to new jersey transit for mr anderson and the 3 , 767 other commuters who have applied for a permit through the west windsor parking authority , the wait can be as long as seven years , officials said another 2 , 833 from west windsor are on a twoyear waiting list for parking lots reserved for township residents commuters do n't have many alternatives at nearby stations thirteen miles to the south , the daily lot at the hamilton train station is filled by 6 30 am , and there are no available permits a few miles south , in trenton , the parking garage operator says the 90amonth specials are all taken , leaving commuters the option of paying 8 a day or 135 a month at a time when gov jon s corzine is pushing for the construction of another commuter rail tunnel under the hudson river , at a cost of 72 billion , transit and local officials have yet to address a longstanding problem even now there are not enough parking spaces and the problem is not unique to new jersey parking is a scarce commodity at many rail stations along the tracks operated by metronorth in westchester county and connecticut and by the long island rail road in nassau and suffolk counties in westchester , there are about 26 , 000 parking spaces for 75 , 000 commuters on long island , almost half of the parking lots are more than 95 percent full if we 're growing the commuter rail system , we have to grapple with how we are going to get people to the trains , said jon orcutt , the executive director of the tristate transportation campaign in new york , a mass transit advocacy group it s a major planning issue with towns across the metropolitan area yet , commuters without parking permits find themselves caught between municipalities reluctant to build parking garages and state transit agencies , like new jersey transit and new york s metropolitan transportation authority , which operates metronorth and the long island rail road , that have failed to keep up with the growing demand the names of many commuters still dreaming of a permit to call their own are on waiting lists longer than their vehicles in the meantime , people find themselves paying hefty fees at private lots and , at princeton junction , even offering nearby homeowners 100 a month to use their driveways gone are what transportation officials call the kiss and ride days , when wives dropped husbands off at the station and picked them up at night for many families , the parking crunch has created a hardship , particularly for those working parents who ca n't drop their children off at day care centers before 7 am or who would like to put their child on the school bus come september , but ca n't afford to wave goodbye because parking spots vanish just after dawn those who live too far to walk to train and bus stations have come up with assorted strategies , including getting there by bicycle , inline skating , even skateboards in new jersey and across the region , municipalities own and operate most of the parking lots at train stations this means that residents usually get parking permits before nonresidents it also means that municipalities can restrict the expansion of parking lots and throw up obstacles to proposed parking garages , often out of concern that additional spaces would attract more commuters from outside the community , leading to more traffic adding a big monolithic structure like a parking garage makes people from small towns feel like the bigcity boogeyman is coming , said darius sollohub , a professor at the new jersey institute of technology who heads the infrastructure planning program at the college s school of architecture it makes them feel that they have become too urban , that they are a city now and no longer a town , mr sollohub said it goes against the reasons for why they moved to a small town in the first place
